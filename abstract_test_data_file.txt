2654882	"Exposure of the skin to solar ultraviolet (UV) radiations causes important oxidative damages that result in clinical and hystopathological changes, contributing to premature skin aging. Hyperpigmented lesions, also known as age spots, are one of the most visible alterations in skin photoaging. Skin is naturally equipped with antioxidant systems against UV-induced ROS generation; however, these antioxidant defenses are not completely efficient during exposure to sunlight. Oral antioxidants are able to counteract the harmful effects of UV radiation and to strengthen the physiological skin antioxidant defenses.                                                                             The present study was performed to evaluate the in vivo skin photo-protecting and anti-aging effects of a red orange (Citrus sinensis varieties Moro, Tarocco and Sanguinello) extract supplementation. Previous studies showed that red orange extracts possess strong in vitro free radical scavenging/antioxidant activity and photo-protective effects on human skin.                                                                                        The photo-protective effects of red orange extract intake against UV-induced skin erythema and melanin production in solar lentigo was evaluated on healthy volunteers by an objective instrumental method (reflectance spectrophotometry).                                                                              Data obtained from in vivo studies showed that supplementation of red orange extract (100 mg/daily) for 15 days brought a significant reduction in the UV-induced skin erythema degree. Moreover, skin age spots pigmentation (melanin content) decreased from 27% to 7% when subjects were exposed to solar lamp during red orange extract supplementation.                                                                                      Red orange extract intake can strengthen physiological antioxidant skin defenses, protecting skin from the damaging processes involved in photo-aging and leading to an improvement in skin appearance and pigmentation."
3739089	"Frosty pod rot (FPR) of Theobroma cacao (cacao) is caused by the hemibiotrophic fungus Moniliophthora roreri. Cacao clones tolerant to FPR are being planted throughout Central America. To determine whether M. roreri shows a differential molecular response during successful infections of tolerant clones, we collected field-infected pods at all stages of symptomatology for two highly susceptible clones (Pound-7 and CATIE-1000) and three tolerant clones (UF-273, CATIE-R7 and CATIE-R4). Metabolite analysis was carried out on clones Pound-7, CATIE-1000, CATIE-R7 and CATIE-R4. As FPR progressed, the concentrations of sugars in pods dropped, whereas the levels of trehalose and mannitol increased. Associations between symptoms and fungal loads and some organic and amino acid concentrations varied depending on the clone. RNA-Seq analysis identified 873 M. roreri genes that were differentially expressed between clones, with the primary difference being whether the clone was susceptible or tolerant. Genes encoding transcription factors, heat shock proteins, transporters, enzymes modifying membranes or cell walls and metabolic enzymes, such as malate synthase and alternative oxidase, were differentially expressed. The differential expression between clones of 43 M. roreri genes was validated by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The expression profiles of some genes were similar in susceptible and tolerant clones (other than CATIE-R4) and varied with the biotrophic/necrotropic shift. Moniliophthora roreri genes associated with stress metabolism and responses to heat shock and anoxia were induced early in tolerant clones, their expression profiles resembling that of the necrotrophic phase. Moniliophthora roreri stress response genes, induced during the infection of tolerant clones, may benefit the fungus in overcoming cacao defense mechanisms."
7472768	"Asexual spores of the rice blast fungus germinate to produce a specialized and melanized infection structure, the appressorium, which is pivotal to successful plant penetration. To investigate whether Magnaporthe grisea counteracts the toxic burst of H2O2 localized beneath the site of attempted invasion, we examined the temporal expression of five candidate antioxidant genes. Of these, the putatively secreted large subunit catalase CATB gene was 600-fold up-regulated in vivo, coincident with penetration, and moderately up-regulated in vitro, in response to exogenous H2O2. Targeted gene replacement of CATB led to compromised pathogen fitness; the catB mutant displayed paler pigmentation and accelerated hyphal growth but lower biomass, poorer sporulation, fragile conidia and appressoria, and impaired melanization. The catB mutant was severely less pathogenic than Guy 11 on barley and rice, and its infectivity was further reduced on exposure to H2O2. The wild-type phenotype was restored by the reintroduction of CATB into the catB mutant We found no evidence to support a role for CATB in detoxification of the host-derived H2O2 at the site of penetration. Instead, we demonstrated that CATB plays a part in strengthening the fungal wall, a role of particular importance during forceful entry into the host."
5835936	"The value of psoriatic plaques pretreatment with specific topical preparations in the setting of NB-ultraviolet-B (UVB) therapy is debatable. It may be clarified through a comparative assessment between crude coal tar and petrolatum as pretreatment candidates.                                                                              A prospective study included 40 patients with plaque psoriasis undergoing NB-UVB therapy. We compared among three treatment regimens: NB-UVB alone (control group; n=20) as well as NB-UVB preceded by crude coal tar 3% on one side and petrolatum on the other side (cases group I and II; n=20). Tar and petrolatum were topically applied thrice/day the day before NB-UVB exposure. Applications were removed using olive oil directly before NB-UVB exposure. Regimens' frequency was thrice/week and the clinical outcome was assessed, through both psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) and physician global assessment (PGA) scores, at baseline and 3 months later.                                                                              There were significant (P<   0.01) decreases in both PASI and PGA scores in all the groups. In comparison with the controls, cases revealed significantly (P<   0.05) higher improvement percentages in both PASI and PGA scores for both tar and petrolatum. This influence, through the PGA score, was significantly (P<   0.05) in favor of petrolatum.                                                                                     The pretreatment of psoriatic plaques with either petrolatum or crude coal tar may enhance the therapeutic outcome of NB-UVB, which appeared to favor petrolatum."
3058480	"Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) can develop at any time during the course of psoriasis.                                                                             The aims of these practical recommendations are to help dermatologists identify patients at risk of PsA, to diagnose PsA in collaboration with rheumatologists and to gain a better understanding of initial PsA management.                                                                                            A scientific committee consisting of 10 dermatologists and a rheumatologist selected clinically relevant questions to be addressed by evidence-based recommendations using the DELPHI method. For each question, a systematic literature review was performed in Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library databases. The levels of evidence of all selected and reviewed articles were appraised according to the Oxford levels of evidence.                                                                              An expert board of 30 dermatologists reviewed and analysed the evidence and developed recommendations for the selected questions. Agreement among participants was assessed on a 10-point scale, and the potential impact of the recommendations on clinical practice was evaluated. Among the 6960 references identified, 190 relevant articles were included in the reviews. Three recommendations regarding risk factors for PsA and one regarding PsA prevalence were issued. The mean agreement score between participants varied from 7.8 to 9.6. Three recommendations on PsA screening tools that can be used by dermatologists were issued. The mean agreement score between participants varied from 7.7 to 9.4. Initial PsA treatment options according to published guidelines were critically appraised for axial and peripheral involvement and enthesitis/dactylitis. Three recommendations were issued. The mean agreement score between participants varied from 7.6 to 8.7.                                                                                     The systematic literature research and meta-analyses did not provide high-quality evidence to support recommendations regarding PsA screening. Conversely, PsA treatment options were supported by strong evidence.                                                                                     Cooperation between dermatologists and rheumatologists should be emphasized to better identify and manage PsA patients."
3116667	"Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a group of inherited rare diseases characterized by fragility and blistering of the skin and mucous membranes. An EB nevus (EBN) is a very rare acquired nevus that occurs only in patients with EB. An EBN usually arises in an area of previous blistering, and frequently has an atypical appearance that mimics malignant melanoma. We describe an older man with an EBN on the sole. Physical examination revealed irregularly pigmented band-like black macules on his right sole, suggestive of malignant melanoma. Dermoscopic examination showed a parallel furrow pattern with a monotonous area. The histopathological findings were consistent with a benign acquired nevus. Interestingly, the lesion regressed spontaneously within a year. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of EBN on the sole. Dermoscopy may be a useful addition to histopathological examination to ensure correct diagnosis of EBN."
5211457	"In eukaryotic cells, transduction of external stimuli into the nucleus to induce transcription and export of mRNAs for translation in the cytoplasm is mediated by nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) composed of nucleoporin proteins (Nups). We previously reported that Arabidopsis MOS3, encoding the homolog of vertebrate Nup96, is required for plant immunity and constitutive resistance mediated by the de-regulated Toll interleukin 1 receptor/nucleotide-binding/leucine-rich repeat (TNL)-type R gene snc1. In vertebrates, Nup96 is a component of the conserved Nup107-160 nuclear pore sub-complex, and implicated in immunity-related mRNA export. Here, we used a reverse genetics approach to examine the requirement for additional subunits of the predicted Arabidopsis Nup107-160 complex in plant immunity. We show that, among eight putative complex members, beside MOS3, only plants with defects in Nup160 or Seh1 are impaired in basal resistance. Constitutive resistance in the snc1 mutant and immunity mediated by TNL-type R genes also depend on functional Nup160 and have a partial requirement for Seh1. Conversely, resistance conferred by coiled coil-type immune receptors operates largely independently of both genes, demonstrating specific contributions to plant defense signaling. Our functional analysis further revealed that defects in nup160 and seh1 result in nuclear accumulation of poly(A) mRNA, and, in the case of nup160, considerable depletion of EDS1, a key positive regulator of basal and TNL-triggered resistance. These findings suggest that Nup160 is required for nuclear mRNA export and full expression of EDS1-conditioned resistance pathways in Arabidopsis."
5887133	"The earliest clinical signs of Fabry disease often manifest as dermatologic disturbances such as angiokeratomata, hypohidrosis, acroparesthesias, and impaired thermal and vibration detection. These disturbances are caused by cellular globotriaosylceramide accumulation in the skin due to deficient lysosomal alpha-galactosidase A activity. In this histologic study, we analyzed pre- and post-treatment dermatologic biopsies from 58 Fabry patients enrolled in a 5 mo, Phase 3 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial followed by a 30 mo open label extension study of recombinant human alpha-galactosidase A (r-halphaGalA), administered i.v. at 1 mg per kg every 2 wk. Baseline evaluations revealed globotriaosylceramide in multiple dermal cell types (vascular endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, perineurium). Five months of r-halphaGalA treatment in the Phase 3 trial resulted in complete clearance of globotriaosylceramide from the superficial capillary endothelium in all treatment patients and in only 1 (3%) placebo patient (p<   0.001). The placebo group achieved similar results after 6 mo of r-halphaGalA in the open label trial. The capillary endothelium remained free of globotriaosylceramide for up to 30 mo into the extension study among 39 of 40 (98%) patients who underwent biopsies. Globotriaosylceramide clearance from deep vascular endothelial cells was similarly robust. Vascular smooth muscle cells and perineurium demonstrated moderate clearance. These findings suggest that long-term treatment with r-halphaGalA may halt the progression of pathology and prevent the dermatologic disturbances in Fabry patients, and that periodic dermal biopsies can serve as a reliable monitor of sustained efficacy."
1843098	"Gene therapy is a potentially promising new treatment for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), which has been difficult to treat with conventional therapeutics. Viral vector-mediated somatic gene therapy is a rapidly developing methodology for providing never before achieved capability to deliver specific genes to the CNS in a highly localized and controlled manner. With the advent and refinements of this technology one focus is directed to which genes are the most appropriate to select for specific disease indications. Nerve growth factor (NGF), a potent survival factor for critical cell populations that degenerate in AD, has been chosen already for clinical gene therapy trials in human AD patients. Much knowledge about the pathophysiological underpinnings of AD is still lacking to make clear which patients may benefit from a gene therapy approach. Moreover, a detailed understanding of sustained NGF action in the normal and diseased CNS needs to be resolved before conclusions can be drawn regarding the utility of NGF gene therapy. Systematic efforts to acquire this new knowledge should compel clinically and biologically sophisticated efforts to advance gene therapy for neurodegenerative diseases."
4854910	"Some plant species develop multiple defense traits. To test the hypothesis that plants with both direct and indirect defense traits mainly develop the direct and indirect defense traits under the low and high soil moisture conditions, respectively, the development of multiple defense traits on the young plants of Mallotus japonicus (Thunb.) Muell. Arg., and the number of ants on the plants were experimentally examined under different soil moisture conditions. Under the low soil moisture condition, the plant growth declined, and the trichomes and pellucid dots developed well. The pearl bodies developed on the plants under the high soil moisture condition. The volume of extrafloral nectar secreted and the number of ants on the plants significantly increased under the high soil moisture condition. These results clearly show that the young plants of M. japonicus firmly develop sound direct defense traits under the low soil moisture condition, and they develop indirect defense traits that are less reliable but have relatively low costs under the high soil moisture condition."
7028440	"The development of pulmonary hypertension before heart transplantation increases the risk for postoperative right ventricular failure. Reversibility of pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), which indicates the feasibility of heart transplantation, can be tested with the use of intravenous vasodilators, such as sodium nitroprusside (NaNTP) or prostacyclin. However, the drawback of these drugs is the development of systemic hypotension. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safely and feasibility of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) compared with sodium nitroprusside to test PVR reversibility, while avoiding systemic hypotension.                                                                                            We included all patients who were affected by end stage heart failure undergoing evaluation for heart transplantation if they showed elevated PVR >    2.5 Wood units and mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) >   25 mm Hg. The hemodynamic parameters measured by right heart catheterization were: systolic blood pressure (SBP), mPAP, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and cardiac index (CI). The following variables were derived: transpulmonary gradient (TPG) and PVR. All patients were tested by both iNO (20-40 ppm) and intravenous NaNTP, at increasing dosages which were titrated based on systemic pressure. We randomly assigned the order of administration of iNO and NaNTP.                                                                              The 9 male candidates has an average age of 56 ± 4 years. Seven of the 9 (71%) had postischemic cardiomyopathy, and 2 had idiopathic cardiomyopathy. We observed a reduction of mPAP (32% and 14%), PVR (41% and 32%), TPG (20% and 26%), and SBP (17% and 5%) and an increase of CI with administration of NaNTP and iNO, respectively.                                                                                      We observed a reduction in PVR and mPAP with administration of either iNO and NaNTP. A better effect of NaNTP was attributed to reducted post-load of the left ventricle. However, the main advantage of iNO was the absence of systemic hypotension and its selectivity for pulmonary vascular system, as underscored by TPG reduction."
6814498	"The liver from a patient with familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) scheduled for living donor liver transplantation can be split and transplanted into 2 adult patients with end-stage liver disease. We have performed this procedure, called domino split transplantation, twice. The native liver was split in situ in 1 patient with FAP and ex situ in the other patient with FAP. The recipients of the livers from the patients with FAP and their living donors are doing well without serious complications. Of the 4 secondary recipients, 3 patients survived. Domino split-liver transplantation from a living donor thus appears to be a promising procedure for expansion of the donor pool."
6215027	"Saline, alkaline and mixed saline-alkaline conditions frequently co-occur in soil. In this work, we compared these plant stress sources on the legume Lotus tenuis, regarding their effects on shoot growth and leaf and stem anatomy. In addition, we aimed to gain insight on the plant physiological status of stressed plants. We performed pot experiments with four treatments: control without salt (pH = 5.8; EC = 1.2 dS·m(-1)) and three stress conditions, saline (100 mM NaCl, pH = 5.8; EC = 11.0 dS·m(-1)), alkaline (10 mM NaHCO3, pH = 8.0, EC = 1.9 dS·m(-1)) and mixed salt-alkaline (10 mM NaHCO3 + 100 mM NaCl, pH = 8.0, EC = 11.0 dS·m(-1)). Neutral and alkaline salts produced a similar level of growth inhibition on L. tenuis shoots, whereas their mixture exacerbated their detrimental effects. Our results showed that none of the analysed morpho-anatomical parameters categorically differentiated one stress from the other. However, NaCl- and NaHCO3 -derived stress could be discriminated to different extents and/or directions of changes in some of the anatomical traits. For example, alkalinity led to increased stomatal opening, unlike NaCl-treated plants, where a reduction in stomatal aperture was observed. Similarly, plants from the mixed saline-alkaline treatment characteristically lacked palisade mesophyll in their leaves. The stem cross-section and vessel areas, as well as the number of vascular bundles in the sectioned stem were reduced in all treatments. A rise in the number of vessel elements in the xylem was recorded in NaCl-treated plants, but not in those treated exclusively with NaHCO3."
6992843	"Ginsenoside Ro, an oleanane-type saponin has been screened for activity in experimental models of acute and chronic hepatitis. Ginsenoside Ro (50 and 200 mg/kg, P.O.) inhibited the increase of serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (s-GOT) and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (s-GPT) levels in D-galactosamine (GalN)- and carbon tetrachloride (CCl (4))-induced acute hepatitic rats. Ginsenoside Ro inhibited the increase of connective tissue in the liver of CCl (4)-induced chronic hepatitic rats. Ginsenoside Ro showed a stronger inhibitory effect on the GalN-induced acute hepatitic model than those of the aglycone of ginsenoside Ro, oleanolic acid, or glycyrrhizic acid and its aglycone, glycyrrhetinic acid."
5224119	"The echocardiographic changes and functional outcome from mitral valve repair, combined with partial left ventriculectomy (PLV), the Batista procedure, were investigated. From May 1996 to August 1997 the operation was performed on 57 patients, primarily (95%) transplant candidates with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. All had been Class IV (36.8% had improved to Class III by the time of surgery) on medical therapy, including 40% hospitalized on inotropes and 3 patients on intra-aortic balloon pumps. The mean cardiac index was 2.1+/-0.6 L/min/m2, with a wedge pressure of 24+/-8 mm Hg, and norepinephrine levels of 855+/-500 pg/mL (normal 80-526 pg/mL). There were 2 in-hospital mortalities (3.5%). At 3 months there were significant persistent changes in LV end-diastolic diameter (8.1+/-1.0 cm-6.3+/-0.9 cm) and ejection fraction (13.6+/-6%-23+/-7.7%). Subjective improvement included a mean change in NYHA functional class from 3.7 to 2.2, and objective changes included improvement in peak oxygen consumption from 10.6+/-4 mL/kg/min to 15.4+/-4.5 mL/kg/min. Actuarial survival at 1 year was 82.1%; and freedom from death, relisting for transplantation, and need for LVAD support was 58%. The earliest ""learning curve"" experience with this relatively unstudied operation warrants careful investigation. Many questions remain to be answered, but many patients have demonstrated early subjective and objective improvement."
5256490	"Middle phalangeal hair has been a focus of study in different populations for the absence or presence of this trait. Clinically, this is often perceived as a solely cosmetic feature. However, because of a series of patients questioning the presence of hair on this location, we have performed a more in-depth literature-based evaluation of the trait. The goal of this manuscript was to examine the clinical significance of this anthropological phenomenon. A literature review was performed that focused on the differences of this trait in terms of pattern of presentation, age, race, sex, and usage as an identifiable marker for medical significance in certain medications and criteria for tailored treatment. Anatomically, middle phalangeal hair is mostly on the fourth finger and more ulnar rather than central or symmetric in pattern of deviation. Its presence has been most associated with high prenatal androgen exposure, predisposing patients to suffer from adverse side effects from oral contraceptives. Phalangeal hair may be helpful in tailoring treatment to certain patients from different ethnic backgrounds, and particularly in individuals with unknown ancestry."
1005549	"Erlotinib is an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor, used as a treatment for advanced stage cancer. The most common side effect is cutaneous toxicity including the already known papulopustular reaction. We herein report a case of erlotinib induced target-like purpura, a peculiar cutaneous adverse event. A 57-year-old patient with advanced non-small cell lung cancer was treated by erolotinib 150 mg daily. After taking the drug for three days, an unusual target-like purpura developed on her lower legs. Skin biopsy specimen taken from the lesion revealed an extravasation of erythrocytes in the upper dermis without destruction of blood vessel walls. This skin eruption cleared after the drug was withdrawn and recurred after erlotinib was re-challenged. The mechanism underlying this cutaneous adverse event remains to be elucidated. Physicians should be aware of the rare side effect of this increasingly used drug."
9653679	"In the present study, we describe the in vitro transcription-translation of human tyrosinase-related protein-1 (TRP-1) cDNA and subsequent use of the resulting 35S-labelled TRP-1 in a radioimmunoassay to analyse vitiligo sera for the presence of TRP-1 antibodies. Of 53 vitiligo sera examined in the assay, three (5.7%) were found to be positive for TRP-1 antibodies. In contrast, sera from 20 controls, 10 patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and 10 patients with Graves' disease were all negative for TRP-1 antibodies. Although glycosylation of the labelled protein was necessary for its immunoprecipitation by TRP-1-specific monoclonal antibody TA99, this post-translational processing did not affect the binding of any of the sera tested. All three patients positive for TRP-1 antibodies (aged 50-63 years) had had vitiligo of the symmetrical type for more than 1 year, and all of them also had an associated autoimmune disorder: Graves' disease in one and autoimmune hypothyroidism in two. In addition, antibodies to the melanogenic enzymes tyrosinase and tyrosinase-related protein-2 (TRP-2) were present in their serum. Absorption studies indicated that preincubation with COS-7 cell extract containing either expressed TRP-1, tyrosinase or TRP-2 absorbed out the immunoreactivity of the three sera positive in the radioimmunoassay (RIA) with [35S]TRP-1. The results indicate that autoantibodies to TRP-1 cross-react with tyrosinase and TRP-2, suggesting one or more common epitopes between the three proteins."
7621277	"By 1977, psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA) was established as a highly effective therapy for psoriasis. Because of concerns about potential long-term adverse effects, particularly cancer, the PUVA Follow-Up Study was established to assess long-term risk and benefits of PUVA.                                                                                  We sought to determine the association of certain squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) risk with exposure to PUVA.                                                                              For nearly 30 years, this prospective cohort study of 1380 patients with psoriasis first treated with PUVA in 1975 to 1976 documented exposures and incident events including biopsy-proven skin cancers.                                                                              From 1975 to 2005, 351 of 1380 (25%) cohort patients developed 2973 biopsy-proven SCC and 330 (24%) developed 1729 BCCs. After adjusting for age, gender, and significant confounders, the risk of developing one or more SCC in a year was strongly associated with total number of PUVA treatments (350-450 vs <   50 treatments, incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 6.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.41-8.20). When all tumors are included this risk is significantly higher (IRR = 20.92, 95% CI = 14.08-31.08). Corresponding risks for BCC were much lower (person counts IRR = 3.09, 95% CI = 2.36-4.06; tumor counts IRR = 2.12, 95% CI = 1.47-3.05).                                                                                      This was an observational prospective study of a cohort with severe psoriasis. An unknown factor associated with higher dose exposure to PUVA in our cohort that was not included in our analysis could account for the observed associations.                                                                                     Exposure to more than 350 PUVA treatments greatly increases the risk of SCC. Exposure to fewer than 150 PUVA treatments has, at most, modest effects on SCC risk. Even high-dose exposure to PUVA does not greatly increase BCC risk. The risks of SCC in long-term PUVA-treated patients should be considered in determining the risk of this therapy relative to other treatments for severe psoriasis."
6762325	"We have found substantial amounts (6.6-143 and 0.5-13 micrograms/mg. protein, respectively) of 5,6-dihydroxyindole (5,6-DHI) and 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (5,6-DHI2C), which are key intermediate monomers for the formation of the eumelanin polymer, within coated vesicle fraction of pigment cells. In addition, the amounts of these eumelanin monomers have been found to decrease along with the process of eumelanin polymer formation from coated vesicles to premelanosomes and finally to melanosomes among melanogenic subcellular compartments. Our present findings seem to indicate that coated vesicles transfer not only highly glycosylated T1-tyrosinase but also eumelanin monomers into premelanosomes."
5501206	"Although there are several treatment options available for patients with generalized vitiligo, their efficacy is still a matter of debate. Although shown to be effective, corticosteroids applied either systemically or topically carry the risk of significant side-effects in long-term therapy. We evaluated the effectiveness of intravenous methylprednisolone (8 mg/kg body weight) administered on three consecutive days in patients with generalized vitiligo.                                                                                            A total of 14 patients with progressive or static vitiligo were included in a prospective, open, clinical study.                                                                              Eighty-five per cent of the patients presenting with progressive disease showed cessation of disease progression after the infusion therapy. Repigmentation was observed in 71% of patients with progressive vitiligo. None of the six patients presenting with static disease showed any repigmentation in response to this form of treatment. The therapy was well tolerated in all but one patient who developed intermittent arterial hypertension during therapy.                                                                                      High-dose glucocorticoid pulse therapy may represent a therapeutic option in patients with generalized progressive vitiligo, and should be further evaluated in a prospective, randomized, clinical trial."
4541156	"Genital warts are a cosmetic nuisance. They are caused by low-risk human papillomavirus types, have no oncogenic potential and are not linked to cervical cancer. However, they often cause significant psychological morbidity. Treatments are aimed at eradicating the unsightly lesions and stimulating the immune system to generate clearance and prevent recurrence. Commonly used physical treatment methods include cryotherapy, trichloroacetic acid, laser, and electrocautery. However, many patients respond extremely well to home therapies with either podophyllotoxin or imiquimod. Patients prefer the comfort and dignity of home treatment, and this should be the first-line of treatment for the majority of patients. A routine screen for sexually transmitted infections is appropriate in most cases. Detailed explanation and reassurance are of paramount importance in reducing the psychological distress associated with this unpleasant genital condition."
1909676	"A 72-year-old man with a history of thrombotic CVA causing lateral medullary infarction presented with non-healing ulcers of the right side of the face of 5 months' duration. After extensive investigations, a diagnosis of trigeminal trophic syndrome was made. The ulcers progressed relentlessly despite amitriptyline and gabapentin, and he was treated with a combination of carbamazepine and thermoplastic mask occlusion of the right side of his face. Over the next 10 weeks the shallower facial ulcers began to diminish in depth and diameter, and the deeper ulcers stopped progressing. Although the patient showed early signs of healing, he died because of complications from the CVA."
2645920	"Hypertension and fluid overload (FO) are well-recognized problems in the chronic kidney disease (CKD) population. While the prevalence of hypertension is well documented, little is known about the severity of FO in this population.                                                                              A new bioimpedance spectroscopy device (BCM-Body Composition Monitor) was selected that allows quantitative determination of the deviation in hydration status from normal ranges (DeltaHS). Pre-dialysis systolic blood pressure (BPsys) and DeltaHS was analysed in 500 haemodialysis patients from eight dialysis centres. A graphical tool (HRP-hydration reference plot) was devised allowing DeltaHS to be combined with measurements of BPsys enabling comparison with a matched healthy population (n = 1244).                                                                              Nineteen percent of patients (n = 95) were found to have normal BPsys and DeltaHS in the normal range. Approximately one-third of patients (n = 133) exhibited reasonable control of BPsys and fluids (BPsys <   150 mmHg and DeltaHS <   2.5 L). In only 15% of patients (n = 74) was hypertension observed (BPsys >   150 mmHg) with a concomitant DeltaHS >   2.5 L (possible volume-dependent hypertension). In contrast, 13% of patients (n = 69) were hypertensive with DeltaHS <   1.1 L (possible essential hypertension). In 10% of patients (n = 52), BPsys <   140 mmHg was recorded despite DeltaHS exceeding 2.5 L.                                                                                     Our study illustrated the wide variability in BPsys regardless of the degree of DeltaHS. The HRP provides an invaluable tool for classifying patients in terms of BPsys and DeltaHS and the proximity of these parameters to reference ranges. This represents an important step towards more objective choice of strategies for the optimal treatment of hypertension and FO. Further studies are required to assess the prognostic and therapeutic role of the HRP."
8884958	"Exposure to ozone induced a rapid increase in the levels of the sesquiterpene phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) and the isoflavone puerarin in suspension cell cultures of Pueraria thomsnii Benth. The observed increases in ABA and puerarin were dependent on the concentration of ozone applied to P. thomsnii cell cultures. In order to examine the role of ABA in ozone-induced puerarin production, cell suspensions were pretreated with the ABA biosynthetic inhibitor fluridone. Following ozone exposure, fluridone treatment suppressed ABA accumulation suggesting ABA was normally synthesized de novo through the carotenoid pathway. Fluridone also blocked ozone-induced puerarin production, which could be reversed through application of exogenous ABA. However, in the absence of ozone, ABA itself had no effect on puerarin accumulation in the suspension cells. Taken together, the data indicate that ozone is an efficient elicitor of puerarin production and may be particularly applicable for improving puerarin production in plant cell cultures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ABA is one factor associated with ozone-induced puerarin production in P. thomsnii cell cultures."
8847346	"In Germany there is a lack of robust nationwide data on psoriasis therapy in children.                                                                                           Secondary data from the statutory health insurance Gmnder Ersatzkasse (GEK) of the year 2009 were analyzed. Continuously insured children with psoriasis vulgaris were identified by ICD-10 codes (L 40. X). Their treatment was determined on the basis of prescriptions according to ATC code.                                                                              1,313 of 293,181 children and adolescents had psoriasis (0.45%). Of these, n = 651 (49.6%) received at least one medication during the observation period. Topical and systemic corticosteroids were most frequently prescribed (70.8% and 4.0% respectively). The relative frequency of prescription of systemic corticosteroids was higher in children treated by pediatricians and family physicians (by a factor of 3 and 5, respectively) than in those treated by dermatologists. Vitamin D analogs were the second most frequently prescribed drugs, used far more often by dermatologists (14.7%) than by general practitioners (1.7%) and pediatricians (0.9%).                                                                                      Drug supply for children with psoriasis in Germany appears to be inadequate. The consensus guidelines are not sufficiently considered and the use of systemic corticosteroids is still too high, even after adjustment for steroid-dependent indications. The data underline the necessity of guideline-oriented therapy and implementation of current therapeutic evidence in juvenile psoriasis."
7497063	"Liver transplantation remains the treatment of choice for many forms of end-stage liver disease. In most large series, 5-year actuarial survival is greater than 70%. The majority of the morbidity and mortality occurs in the first 6 months posttransplant; as these figures have improved, so have overall survival rates. Infants under 1 year of age have a survival rate below that of older patients; in addition, a severe organ shortage for these patients continues. The use of reduced grafts has ameliorated the problem to a certain extent; however, further expansion of the donor pool is still necessary. Progress has also been made in the postoperative management of transplant patients. We currently follow AKBR and TNF levels in all patients to aid in the diagnosis of primary nonfunction and acute rejection, respectively. The introduction of additional immunosuppressive agents has instigated several large clinical trials. CsA, however, remains the gold standard to which these drugs must be compared."
1942728	"Immune regulation is critical for the maintenance of peripheral self-tolerance and for down-regulation of immune responses. Understanding its mechanisms may permit the development of novel targets for the promotion of tolerance in transplantation. Co-inhibitory molecules play a major role in modulating T-cell receptor signaling upon antigen encounter. Their unique patterns of expression, structure, and binding partners account for their diverse function and non-redundancy. Moreover, these inhibitory signals have active roles in both effector and regulatory immune cells in multiple sites, including the target tissue. Herein, we review the recent advances in our understanding of co-inhibitory signaling and its potential clinical applications, focusing mainly on the two best-characterized receptors CTLA4 and PD-1. Recent observations in cancer clinical trials using blocking antibodies against PD-1 or CTLA4, or both, showed a high incidence of autoimmune-related side effects, confirming the important role of these pathways in human immune homeostasis."
1352120	"Leukemic transformation (LT) from myelofibrosis has a very poor prognosis with the current treatment strategies. We hypothesized that allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) can improve outcomes for patients with LT, and reviewed 55 consecutive patients that were treated for myelofibrosis with ASCT at our institution. Fourteen patients (25%) were identified to have LT. Thirteen of these patients received induction chemotherapy and 6 achieved remission at the time of transplant. Conditioning regimen was melphalan (Mel)-based in 9 patients. All patients engrafted and achieved remission after transplant, whereas 4 subsequently relapsed. After a median follow-up of 31 months, 6 patients (49%) survived long term. Although limited by a small number of patients, this study suggests that patients with myelofibrosis and LT may achieve long-term remission after induction chemotherapy and ASCT."
6722266	"Post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PT-Cy) is the backbone of GvHD prophylaxis following haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation (haplo-HCT). PT-Cy has also been used in matched related (MRD) and unrelated (MUD) settings. It is not known whether outcomes are similar between haplo-HCT and MRD/MUD HCT when PT-Cy is used. We performed a retrospective analysis of 83 patients with AML who underwent HCT (using PT-Cy-based GvHD prophylaxis) from MRD, MUD or haploidentical donors. The groups were similar in baseline characteristics with the exception of older age in the MRD/MUD group (P=0.012). In multivariate analysis, the effect of donor type (MRD/MUD vs haploidentical) on transplant outcomes was not significant in any of the models except for faster neutrophil recovery after MRD/MUD transplants (hazard ratio: 2.21; 95% confidence interval: 1.31-3.72, P=0.002). In conclusion, we showed similar outcomes in MRD/MUD vs haploidentical HCT (except slower count recovery following haplo-HCT) when PT-Cy is used for GvHD prophylaxis. Although slower count recovery following haplo-HCT (compared with MRD/MUD transplants without PT-Cy) has been attributed to using PT-Cy, our results suggest that HLA disparity is the primary cause of this difference. Furthermore, our analysis supports PT-Cy as a viable option for GvHD prophylaxis after MRD/MUD transplants."

3189388	"A water extract of Coptis chinensis was found to have the ability to stabilize the cleavable complex with mammalian DNA topoisomerase I. As the result of bioassay-guided fractionation, two protoberberine alkaloids, epiberberine and groenlandicine, were identified as active principles with topoisomerase I-mediated DNA cleavage activity in vitro. These two alkaloids did not induce topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage. During further examination of the structurally related protoberberine alkaloids, berberrubine which is produced during the processing of Coptis rhizome as traditional medicine, was identified as a specific inducer of topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage in vitro. These results indicated that protoberberine alkaloids are a chemical family which can induce cleavable complexes with topoisomerases I and II."
7051217	"Two hundred twenty-four patients with leukemia transplanted with an unrelated donor between 1991 and 2003 at the Karolinska University Hospital were analyzed according to association between graft failure and ABO, RhD, MNSs, and Kidd blood group antigen compatibility. Median age was 29 years (range: 0-55). Conditioning consisted of total-body irradiation or busulfan-based myeloablative conditioning. A bone marrow graft was given to 152 patients, and 72 patients received peripheral blood stem cells. Most patients received graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis with cyclosporine and MTX. Graft failure (GF) was seen in 6 (2.7%) patients. In the multivariate analysis major ABO mismatch (odds ratio [OR] 14.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.01-110, P = .008) and HLA-allele mismatch (6.42, 1.19-34.8, P = .03) was significantly associated to GF. In patients with and without major ABO mismatch the incidence of GF was 7.5% and 0.6% (P = .02), respectively. Using an ABO major mismatched graft increases the risk for GF after unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation."
3380006	"Post kala azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) is a sequel to visceral leishmaniasis or kala azar seen predominantly in the Indian subcontinent and Africa. Histopathological descriptions of the condition are limited.                                                                              Biopsies of 88 skin and 16 mucosal lesions were evaluated for histopathological findings on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues.                                                                              There were 71 (80.7%) males and 17 (19.3%) females with a mean age of 24.8 and 28.5 years, respectively. A past history of kala azar was present in 64 (72.7%) patients and post kala azar dermal leishmaniasis developed a mean of 6.2 years after visceral leishmaniasis. Of the biopsies studied, the clinical lesions were macular in 14 (15.9%), papulo-nodular in 32 (36.3%) and showed both macules and papulo-nodules in 42 (47.8%). Follicular plugging was a common epidermal finding. A clear Grenz zone was frequently noted. The dermal infiltrates were arranged mainly in three patterns: superficial perivascular infiltrates in 16 (18.1%), perivascular and perifollicular infiltrates in 24 (27.3%) and diffuse infiltrates in 41 (46.6%) biopsies. Leishman-Donovan (LD) bodies were noted in 13 (44.9%) of 69 cases on slit-skin smear and in 25 (28.4%) of 88 biopsies. In 16 patients, where both skin and mucosal biopsies were available, LD bodies were identified in 10 (62.5%) mucosal biopsies as compared to 3 (18.7%) skin biopsies.                                                                                      The retrospective nature of the study and the lack of controls were limitations.                                                                                     The various histomorphological patterns of post kala azar dermal leishmaniasis are a useful clue to the diagnosis even when LD bodies have not been detected. This study also suggests that LD bodies are more frequently seen in mucosal biopsies in comparison to cutaneous biopsies."
1610310	"Iron overload, which is a common complication in haemodialysis patients, is known to enhance bacterial growth and virulence, and to alter phagocytosis. We reviewed the data of 61 haemodialysed patients to clarify the clinical relevance of iron status to the risk of bacterial infection. Increased concentrations of serum ferritin were associated with a greater infection rate (P less than 0.0025), which was already true for ferritin values between 500 and 1000 micrograms/l (P less than 0.025). Furthermore, in 21 iron-overloaded patients treated with an iron-chelator (desferrioxamine), the infection rate decreased from 1/19 patient-months to 1/112 (P less than 0.005), and returned to previous values when desferrioxamine was stopped. Our results demonstrate the importance of haemosiderosis in the increased susceptibility of haemodialysed patients to infections; this susceptibility is decreased by desferrioxamine therapy, which probably acts by restoring phagocytosis and reducing the bioavailability of iron for pathogens."
8577072	"Both Ca(2+) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) play critical signaling roles in plant responses to biotic and abiotic stress. However, the positioning of Ca(2+) and ROS (in particular H(2)O(2)) after a stress stimulus and their subcellular interactions are poorly understood. Moreover, although information can be encoded in different patterns of cellular Ca(2+) signals, little is known about the subcellular spatiotemporal patterns of ROS production or their significance for downstream responses. Here, we show that ROS production in response to hyperosmotic stress in embryonic cells of the alga Fucus serratus consists of two distinct components. The first ROS component coincides closely with the origin of a Ca(2+) wave in the peripheral cytosol at the growing cell apex, has an extracellular origin, and is necessary for the Ca(2+) wave. Patch-clamp experiments show that a nonselective cation channel is stimulated by H(2)O(2) and may underlie the initial cytosolic Ca(2+) increase. Thus, the spatiotemporal pattern of the Ca(2+) wave is determined by peripheral ROS production. The second, later ROS component localizes to the mitochondria and is a direct consequence of the Ca(2+) wave. The first component, but not the second, is required for short-term adaptation to hyperosmotic stress. Our results highlight the role of ROS in the patterning of a Ca(2+) signal in addition to its function in regulating cell wall strength in the Fucus embryo."
8855264	"Hair root harbours a complex cell pool with an immense developmental potential. Several lineages, including skin, can be differentiated from the multipotent to pluripotent cells of outer root sheath (ORS) of hair follicle. Outer root sheath presents the most opulent non-invasively gained adult stem cell source known. For the purposes of cultivating melanocytes designated for graft-based treatments of depigmentation disorders, we have established an ex vivo/in vitro cultivation method by introducing several methodological improvements to the ORS explant method of Dieckmann. As a result, we gained a higher, purer yield of differentiated melanocytes in half the time (at least 10(6) of 95% pure cells in 4 weeks). This reliable cultivation procedure begins with the epilation of 60 hairs and yields high numbers of ORS melanocytes that could be used for grafting applications. The procedure not only utilises the developmental potential of hair root cell pool and favors differentiation into melanocytes, but also contributes to the general trend of minimal-to-non-invasive strategies for regenerative medicine."
6947243	"Corticosteroid withdrawal after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) represents an attractive therapeutic option for ameliorating post-OLT metabolic complications, although several reports suggest patients who undergo transplantation for autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) may have a greater incidence of acute and chronic rejection when withdrawn from corticosteroid therapy. The aim of this study is to evaluate the success of corticosteroid withdrawal in patients with AIH after OLT. Twenty-six patients underwent successful OLT for AIH. In 21 of these patients, stable maintenance immunosuppression consisted of cyclosporine (CSA) and prednisone (n = 20) or tacrolimus (TAC) and prednisone (n = 1). In this group, a trial of prednisone withdrawal was initiated when patients were 6 months or more post-OLT, with normal liver function, and receiving an average prednisone dosage of 10 mg/d. Five additional patients treated with either TAC (n = 4) or CSA (n = 1) plus mycophenolate mofetil underwent a 14-day taper of prednisone. Overall, 17 of 25 patients (68%) were successfully withdrawn from corticosteroids, with a mean follow-up of 22 months (range, 1 to 34 months). Of the remaining 8 patients, 5 patients received a lower dosage of prednisone or required prednisone to control inflammatory bowel disease. Only 3 patients remained dependent on prednisone to maintain stable liver allograft function. Withdrawal from 10 to 5 mg of prednisone (n = 21) resulted in four episodes of steroid-responsive and two episodes of steroid-resistant rejection in 3 patients, and 18 of 21 patients (86%) were rejection free. Withdrawal from 5 to 0 mg prednisone (n = 17) resulted in eight episodes of steroid-responsive and no episodes of steroid-resistant rejection in 4 patients; 13 of 17 patients (76%) were rejection free. Of the 5 patients in the 14-day prednisone-taper group, 3 patients had steroid-responsive rejection and 1 patient required OKT3. Seventeen of 21 patients (81%) with AIH were successfully withdrawn from corticosteroids. It is notable that corticosteroid withdrawal was associated with a reduction in serum cholesterol levels, decreased use of antihypertensive agents, and reduced need for insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. We propose corticosteroid withdrawal should be attempted in patients with underlying AIH who undergo OLT because most will benefit without significantly jeopardizing the liver allograft."
2592060	"Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) are severe mucocutaneous reactions that incur high mortality, and in which the systemic application of corticosteroids remains controversial.                                                                                  This study aimed to determine the optimal protocols for the use of corticosteroids and treatment measures.                                                                              We performed a retrospective analysis of 70 patients with SJS/TEN who were hospitalized between January 2008 and May 2015 in the Department of Dermatology, Shandong Provincial Hospital, and treated with corticosteroids. Expected and actual mortality rates in patients treated with different doses of corticosteroids, according to SCORTEN, were compared.                                                                              The diagnoses associated with initial corticosteroid use differed significantly between the low- and high-dose groups (P = 0.041). There were significant differences between expected and actual mortality rates according to the use of corticosteroid therapy (P = 0.0168, standardized mortality ratio [SMR] = 0.30). There was a statistical difference between expected and actual mortality rates in the low-dose group (P = 0.0145, SMR = 0.20). Serum albumin levels were significantly lower in patients administered corticosteroids additive therapy (31.12 ± 8.32 g/l vs. 35.54 ± 5.82 g/l; P = 0.016), and the rate of use of antibiotics was higher among patients in the additive therapy group than in the non-additive group (94.7% vs. 60.8%).                                                                                      Our research supports the use of corticosteroids for the systemic treatment of SJS/TEN. Corticosteroids should be used in a timely manner and in accordance with disease severity, age, underlying diseases, serum albumin level, and concurrent treatment with antimicrobial therapy."
8994635	"The introduction of proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) for fast response measurements of volatile organic compounds (VOC) has enabled the use of eddy covariance methods to investigate VOC fluxes on the ecosystem scale. In this study PTR-MS flux measurements of VOC were performed over agricultural grassland during and after a cut event. Selected masses detected by the PTR-MS showed fluxes of methanol, acetaldehyde, and acetone. They were highest directly after cutting and during the hay drying phase. Simultaneously, significant fluxes of protonated ion masses 73, 81, and 83 were observed. Due to the limited identification of compounds with the PTR-MS technique, GC-MS and GC-FID-PTR-MS techniques were additionally applied. In this way, ion mass 73 could be identified as 2-butanone, mass 81 mainly as (Z)-3-hexenal, and mass 83 mainly as the sum of (Z)-3-hexenol and hexenyl acetates. Hexenal, hexenols, and the hexenyl acetates are mostly related to plant wounding during cutting. It was found that legume plants and forbs emit a higher number of different VOC species than graminoids."

We performed a retrospective review of 169 adult and pediatric patients who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center from January 1, 2000 though December 31, 2001, who had at least 1 microbiologic stool study. We report on the incidence of enteric pathogens in our population and diagnostic yield of stool studies. A diarrheal episode was defined as a 14-day period from the date of the first stool study. Cost savings analysis was based on projected savings from implementation of proposed guidelines to the study population.                                                                              A total of 1649 stool tests were performed (mean 10.6 tests per patient). An infectious cause of diarrhea was found in 45 (28.8%) patients. Diagnostic yield was 6.2% for Clostridum difficile toxin assay, 12.9% for viral cultures, and 1.3% for rotavirus enzyme immunoassay. Bacterial cultures for enteric pathogens, examination for parasites, and rotavirus antigen assay combined had 0.5% positive yield.                                                                                      Testing of multiple specimens per diarrheal episode did not increase diagnostic yield. The estimated cost savings by implementing single testing for each type of stool study per diarrheal episode was $49,764 annually (in 2001 US dollars). Judicious use of stool tests to evaluate diarrhea results in significant cost savings without compromising diagnostic yield."
4631306	"We have observed that treatments with salicylic acid (SA) or gentisic acid (GA) induced resistance to RNA pathogens such as ToMV and CEVd in tomato and Gynura auriantiaca, respectively. Accumulation of SA and GA has been found to occur in plants infected by these pathogens, thus pointing out a possible defence role of both molecules. To study the molecular basis of the observed induced resistance to RNA pathogens the induction of silencing-related genes by SA and GA was considered. For that purpose, we searched for tomato genes which were orthologous to those described in Arabidopsis thaliana, such as AtDCL1, AtDCL2, AtDCL4, AtRDR1, AtRDR2 and AtRDR6, and we tracked their induction in tomato along virus and viroid infections. We observed that CEVd significantly induced all these genes in tomato, with the exception of ToRDR6, being the induction of ToDCL4 the most outstanding. Regarding the ToMV asymptomatic infection, with the exception of ToRDR2, we observed a significant induction of all the indicated silencing-related genes, being ToDCL2 the most induced gene. Subsequently, we analyzed their transcriptional activation by SA and at the time when ToMV was inoculated on plants. ToDCL2, ToRDR1 and ToRDR2 were significantly induced by both SA and GA, whereas ToDCL1 was only induced by SA. Such an induction resulted more effective by SA treatment, which is in agreement with the stronger SA-induced resistance observed. Our results suggest that the observed delay in the RNA pathogen accumulation could be due to the pre-induction of RNA silencing-related genes by SA or GA."
6572702	"Deficiency in zinc, an essential trace element, is a frequent human dietary problem in the United States and is also associated with such disease states as alcoholism, renal disease, burns, gastrointestinal tract disorders, and acrodermatitis enteropathica. Skin lesions and poor wound healing are observed in severe forms of the deficiency. However, modest deficits in zinc cause lymphopenia and reduced immune capacity among affected humans. With the mouse used as a model because it has an immune system analogues to that of humans, the effects of zinc deficiency on immune function have been well characterized. A suboptimal intake of zinc causes marked atrophy of the thymus, a 50% reduction in leukocytes, a rise in corticosterone levels, and a 40% to 70% reduction in antibody-mediated, cell-mediated, and delayed-type hypersensitivity responses."
7372350	"Maculopapular exanthemas have a particular high incidence among patients treated with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In most cases, a viral or drug induced origin is easily identified. However, the transplantation itself may also induce similar skin changes. These exanthemas are known under various names, such as autologous graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), engraftment syndrome (ES) or eruption of lymphocyte recovery (ELR). Given the clinical and histopathological similarities of these disorders, it can prove difficult to establish a diagnosis. Here, we describe a patient who developed a maculopapular exanthema after autologous stem cell transplantation for multiple myeloma, diagnosed as autologous GVHD. We also briefly review the current knowledge of the pathogenesis of autologous GVHD, ES, and ELR. Based on these data we would like to suggest that the latter two do not reflect own disease entities but rather different presentations of autologous GVHD."
1645866	"Leflunomide is a novel immunosuppressive agent with promising activity for xenotransplantation. It is not clear yet which mechanisms of action of leflunomide are responsible for that.                                                                              In a hamster-to-C57BL/6 nude mouse heart transplantation model, a 2-week course of leflunomide was used after transplantation or for pretreating donors. Nontolerant B lymphocytes were transferred to recipients after transplantation of first or second xenogeneic heart grafts that were transplanted with or without leflunomide treatment.                                                                              Hamster xenogeneic hearts transplanted into athymic C57BL/6 nude mice receiving leflunomide did not induce immunoglobulin (Ig) M xenoantibodies (XAb) and survived without signs of chronic rejection. Second xenogeneic hearts transplanted 4 weeks after withdrawal of leflunomide survived without induction of XAb but developed chronic vascular lesions. After injection of naive B lymphocytes at 6 weeks after grafting a first or second hamster heart, only in the latter case were XAb induced. These were deposited in, and provoked acute rejection of, only the second grafts. Pretreatment of donors with leflunomide decreased the ex vivo xenoantibody deposition on the xenogeneic heart endothelia.                                                                                      A short posttransplant course of leflunomide induces T-independent B-lymphocyte xenotolerance. Leflunomide treatment also influences xenoantigen expression, as nontolerant B lymphocytes provoke IgM XAb formation and rejection of only second xenografts (transplanted without leflunomide) and not of first xenografts (transplanted with leflunomide treatment). The ex vivo experiments that show that XAb deposition is decreased in leflunomide-pretreated xenografts further confirm this. The latter may also explain the resistance of first and not second xenografts against chronic rejection."
4254218	"There is a relative lack of donor organs for liver transplantation. Ideally, to maximize the utility of those livers that are offered, donor and recipient characteristics should be matched to ensure the best possible posttransplant survival of the recipient.                                                                              With prospectively collected data on 827 patients receiving a primary liver graft for chronic liver disease, we used a self-organizing map (SOM) (one form of a neural network) to predict outcome after transplantation using both donor and recipient factors. The SOM was then validated using a data set of 2622 patients undergoing transplantation in the United Kingdom at other centers.                                                                              SOM analysis using 72 inputs and two survival intervals (3 and 12 months) yielded three neurons with either higher or lower probabilities of survival. The model was validated using the independent data set. With 20 patients on the waiting list and 10 sequential donor livers, it was possible to demonstrate that the model could be used to identify which potential recipients were likely to benefit most from each liver offered.                                                                                      With this approach to matching donor livers and recipients, it is possible to inform transplant clinicians about the optimum use of donor livers and thereby effectively make the best use of a scarce resource."
3751329	"Disseminated varicella-zoster virus infection after organ transplantation in adults is a rare but serious event causing significant morbidity and mortality. We describe our 10-year experience of 13 cases in a single center, including risk factors for infection, lack of protection from pre-existing anti-varicella-zoster virus antibodies, and unusual modes of presentation, including disseminated intravascular coagulation. We also report our preliminary observation of resolution of infection without sequelae in 4 patients with severe disseminated varicella-zoster virus infection who were treated with the combination of intravenous acyclovir and polyspecific intravenous immunoglobulin."
9913191	"During a 23-month period, 18 patients with facial or genital herpetic lesions were examined; culture specimens from each patient were obtained three times per week for virologic studies. The isolated viruses were identified, and the average duration of herpesvirus in lesions was determined. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) was isolated from facial lesions for a mean duration of 3 1/2 days. In contrast, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) was isolated from genital lesions for a mean duration of 5 1/2 days. The duration of viral persistence in lesions of patients with mild primary infection did not seem to differ from that in patients with recurrent infection."
7502808	"The expression of chloroplast and mitochondrial genes depends on nucleus-encoded proteins, some of which control processing, stability, and/or translation of organellar RNAs. To test the specificity of one such RNA stability factor, we used two known Chlamydomonas reinhardtii nonphotosynthetic mutants carrying mutations in the Mcd1 nuclear gene (mcd1-1 and mcd1-2). We previously reported that these mutants fail to accumulate the chloroplast petD mRNA and its product, subunit IV of the cytochrome b6/f complex, which is essential for photosynthesis. Such mutants are generally presumed to be gene specific but are not tested rigorously. Here, we have used microarray analysis to assess changes in chloroplast, mitochondrial, and nuclear RNAs, and since few other RNAs were significantly altered in these mutants, conclude that Mcd1 is indeed specifically required for petD mRNA accumulation. In addition, a new unlinked nuclear mutation was discovered in mcd1-2, which greatly reduced chloroplast atpA mRNA accumulation. Genetic analyses showed failure to complement mda1-ncc1, where atpA-containing transcripts are similarly affected (D. Drapier, J. Girard-Bascou, D.B. Stern, F.-A. Wollman [2002] Plant J 31: 687-697), and we have named this putative new allele mda1-2. We conclude that DNA microarrays are efficient and useful for characterizing the specificity of organellar RNA accumulation mutants."
5237981	"Peritonitis and exit-site infections (ESI) are major causes of morbidity in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. The application of topical mupirocin to exit sites reduces such complications, and prolongs life in PD. Since the year 2000, this topical treatment has been used in our hospital on new PD patients. We analysed the results of this protocol, and studied the effects of comorbidities on the incidence of peritonitis.                                                                              We studied 740 incident PD patients, who were divided into two groups based on year of entry into PD (Group 1 from January 1998 to December 1999 inclusive, topical mupirocin not used, and Group 2 from January 2000 to March 2004 inclusive, topical mupirocin used). The variables we studied included gender, age, diabetic status, ischaemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease and serum albumin.                                                                              The application of topical mupirocin at the exit site led to a significant reduction in the rate of peritonitis (0.443 vs 0.339 episodes per patient-year; P<   0.0005) and in ESI (0.168 vs 0.156 episodes per patient-year; P<   0.005), results attributed primarily by the significant (P<   0.005) reduction in Staphylococcus aureus infection. There was also an unexpected lowering of Pseudomonas aeruginosa peritonitis in the mupirocin group (P<   0.005). Stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that only the application of mupirocin and serum albumin levels were significant predictors of peritonitis.                                                                                      Our study, although retrospective, has demonstrated that the topical use of mupirocin was associated with a significant reduction in ESI and peritonitis and, unexpectedly, with findings of fewer incidences of Pseudomonas peritonitis. Serum albumin level before the initiation of PD was a strong predictor of subsequent peritonitis. Mupirocin, with its low toxicity, ease of application and demonstrable beneficial effect in reducing ESI and peritonitis is now used on all of our incident PD patients."
3846888	"Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) is a commensal microorganism found in sebum-rich skin and plays a role in acne inflammation by stimulating keratinocyte to produce a number of proinflammatory cytokines. However, the role of P. acnes in the dermis of acne lesions, where tissue remodeling after inflammation eventually takes place, is not known. In this study, we investigated whether P. acnes induces matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), a key enzyme involved in matrix remodeling in human dermal fibroblasts (hDF). We found that P. acnes increased expression of pro-matrix metalloproteinase (proMMP)-2 mRNA/protein in hDF, but not that of proMMP-9. Concomitantly, P. acnes induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) mRNA/protein expression in hDF, which in turn increases both proMMP-2 mRNA and protein expression. P. acnes induced such changes through the activated NF-kappaB pathway. Doxycycline was found to inhibit the expression of proMMP-2 induced either by P. acnes or TNF-alpha. These results suggest that P. acnes stimulates hDF to produce TNF-alpha, which mediates the expression of proMMP-2 through the NF-kappaB pathway. The secretion of proMMP-2 from hDF upon P. acnes stimulation may contribute to the pathogenesis of tissue remodeling in acne skin."
8296348	"When an ""isolated"" single lymph node is challenged with irradiated allogeneic lymphocytes, there is a change in the reactivity of the lymphocytes flowing out of the node when they are cultured in vitro in unidirectional mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC) against the immunizing lymphocytes. These changes in the reactivity of the recipient lymphocytes are shortlived, follow a set time sequence in relation to the cell traffic changes accompanying the immune response, are the property of small lymphocytes and not blast cells, are exhibited by surface Ig-negative cells, and they are specific for the donor lymphocytes. It is suggested that antigen causes the selective retention of antigen-specific lymphocytes within the stimulated node followed by the proliferation and differentiation of large numbers of antigen-specific cells, which then leave the lymph node as small lymphocytes."
8572804	"Previous work has demonstrated that short-term systemic administration of cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) Ig blocks human pancreatic islet xenograft rejection in mice and induces long-term, donor-specific tolerance, whereas studies on pig pancreatic islet rejection in mice have failed to demonstrate a role for CTLA4Ig in preventing rejection. Treatment with anti-CD40 ligand (L) monoclonal antibodies alone is somewhat effective in prolonging the survival of islet xenografts, but ineffective when applied to skin xenografts. However, simultaneous blockade of the CD28 and CD40 co-stimulatory pathways prolongs the survival of pig skin on recipient mice. To evaluate the role of CD28 and CD40 co-stimulatory pathways in pig islet-like cell cluster (ICC) xenograft rejection in mice, CD40L-deficient mice transplanted with fetal porcine ICCs were given posttransplant treatment with human (h) CTLA4Ig or a human IgG1 chimeric mAb (hL6). Xenografts were evaluated 6 or 12 days after transplantation. Fetal porcine ICC xenografts were protected from rejection in hCTLA4Ig-treated CD40L-deficient mice, whereas xenograft rejection persisted in untreated CD40L-deficient mice. Simultaneous blockade of the CD28 and CD40 co-stimulatory pathways is mandatory to inhibit ICC xenograft rejection in the pig-to-mouse model, because the CD28 and CD40 co-stimulatory pathways seem capable of efficiently substituting for one another."
6820108	"Secondary metabolism plays an important role in plant life as well as the interaction between plants and environmental factors. Many secondary metabolites derived from plants have been used for the production of medicines, dyes, insecticides, food flavors, fragrances and so on. With increasingly comprehensive understanding of the plant metabolic networks, great progress has been made in the genetic improvement of plant secondary metabolic pathways through gene engineering. Strategies for the genetic engineering of plant secondary metabolism include: (1) enabling the host plant to accumulate a novel desirable compound by transformation of single/multiple enzyme gene (s) or a whole metabolic pathway; (2) decreasing target gene expression or inhibiting competitive metabolic pathway to achieve metabolic flux towards higher production of particular molecules through antisense RNA and RNA interference technologies; (3) effectively manipulating the transcription factors responsible for the metabolic regulation at multiple steps in a given pathway so as to have a great synthesis of the target bio-chemicals. Basing on author's research work on flavonoid synthesis mechanism in soybean seed and its gene engineering, recent progress in the engineering of plant secondary metabolism involved in the synthesis of anthocyanins, flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, benzoic acid derivatives etc are reviewed."
6155127	"Laparoscopic living kidney nephrectomy is thought to be associated with reduced morbidity, when compared to open nephrectomy. The purpose of this study was to explore the impact of these techniques on donors' clinical outcomes, satisfaction and motivation to donate.                                                                              Clinical outcomes were retrospectively compared in 152 open (n = 71) or laparoscopic (n = 81) donor procedures. Donor satisfaction and motivation were assessed with a self-administered questionnaire.                                                                              The complication rate was the same with both procedures and the majority of complications were mild. Laparoscopy was significantly less painful and resulted in an insignificantly faster return to active life. More than 80% of the donors volunteered to donate without pressure. Worries about future health status, pain or scars were not important in the decision to donate. Similarly, only 15% considered the surgical procedure as instrumental for their decision. Few donors currently worried about their health with one kidney and more than 95% of the donors in both groups stated that they would give their kidney again.                                                                                      Living donor nephrectomy is safe, regardless of the procedure used. Although the laparoscopic nephrectomy offers clear short-term benefits over the open nephrectomy, donors' satisfaction was excellent with both surgical approaches. Moreover, the type of procedure did not seem to influence their decision to donate."
7424758	"To investigate the outcomes in patients who have pre-existing diabetes and those who develop post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM).                                                                              We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 939 patients who received a first functioning renal transplant in the cyclosporine (CyA) era between 1984 and 1999.                                                                              Sixty-six (7%) patients had renal failure due to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and 7 (0.8%) patients due to non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Ten (1.1%) patients had coexistent diabetes and 48 (5.1%) recipients developed PTDM. The mean graft survival for the patients with PTDM was 9.7 yr versus 11.3 yr for the non-diabetic patients, while mean graft survival was 10.1 yr for patients with IDDM and 2.9 yr with NIDDM and 8.3 yr for those with coexistent diabetes (p=ns). However, there was a statistically significant difference in patient survival between patients who developed PTDM and in those who did not develop this complication. The mean survivals of patients with IDDM, NIDDM, coexistent diabetics and PTDM were 8.4, 3.7, 8.6 and 10.3 yr, respectively. The mean survival of the patients without pre-existing diabetes or PTDM was 12.8 yr (p<   0.001). The survival of patients older than 55 yr with PTDM was no different to the control group. However, in those younger than 55 yr, PTDM was associated with a higher risk of death (relative risk of 2.54, p<   0.001). Fifty percent of patients with IDDM developed acute rejection episodes, whereas rejection rate was 57.1% in NIDDM group, 50.0% in the PTDM group, 20.0% in the coexistent diabetes group and 44.3% in the control group (p=ns).                                                                                     Patient survival, but not graft survival, was adversely affected by both pre-existing diabetes and by PTDM, particularly in those with an age less than 55 yr."
9477966	"Segmental vitiligo and generalized vitiligo are in general considered to be separate entities. The aetiopathogenesis of segmental vitiligo remains unclear, although several hypotheses have been put forward including mainly neuronal mechanisms. The typical association with other autoimmune diseases, as seen in generalized vitiligo, seems to be significantly less in segmental vitiligo, although recent insights point towards a possible immune-mediated overlap between the two subtypes. In this article, we describe a case with simultaneous presence of segmental vitiligo, alopecia areata, psoriasis and a halo naevus. To our knowledge, this is the first case with this exceptional combination. This concomitant presence could support the involvement of a shared autoimmune-mediated process, and may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of segmental vitiligo and direct future research. In the light of this remarkable case, different possible aetiopathogenetic mechanisms leading to the clinical presentation of segmental vitiligo are discussed and a new three-step theory is proposed."
2703793	"We present the application of the generative topographic map algorithm to visualize the chemical space populated by natural products and synthetic drugs. Generative topographic maps may be used for nonlinear dimensionality reduction and probabilistic modeling. For compound mapping, we represented the molecules by two-dimensional pharmacophore features (chemically advanced template search descriptor). The results obtained suggest a close resemblance of synthetic drugs with natural products in terms of their pharmacophore features, despite pronounced differences in chemical structure. Generative topographic map-based cluster analysis revealed both known and new potential activities of natural products and drug-like compounds. We conclude that the generative topographic map method is suitable for inferring functional similarities between these two classes of compounds and predicting macromolecular targets of natural products."
8450196	"Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is characterized by the local and gradual transformation of terminal scalp hair into vellus hair, which has a shorter and thinner shaft. There are no studies that analyze annual changes in age, patterns, family history, and associated disease.                                                                                  We investigated the severity of hair loss, age of onset, the frequency of family history, and past medical histories in Korean patients with AGA.                                                                              A retrospective chart review was performed to identify all patients with AGA referred to the Dermatology Clinic at Chung-Ang University Hospital from January 2006 to December 2010.                                                                              The age of onset was also gradually decreased from 34.1±10.1 years to 31.6±10.9 years between 2006 and 2010. In female patients, specific annual changes were not observed. Hamilton-Norwood Type IIIv AGA was most common in male patients and Ludwig Type I AGA was most common in female patients at all times between 2006 and 2010. The majority of patients with AGA had a family history of baldness and was most commonly associated with a paternal pattern of inheritance. Seborrheic dermatitis was the most common associated disease in male and female patients.                                                                                     Our results show the possibilities that the average age of onset is decreasing. The period of the present study was only 5 years, which is not sufficient for the precise determination of onset age for AGA. Clearly, a long-term study is needed."
7937928	"Dermatology services are largely outpatient based. Time for satisfactory patient communication is limited, with an average of around 15 min per new patient. The amount of new information that can be retained after verbal communication alone is limited during such consultations. One way to reinforce such information is to send patients a copy of the hospital specialist's letter to the general practitioner. Before advocating this unreservedly, it is important to explore the value patients attach to receiving such a letter and to estimate the cost of this practice. In order to explore patients' views of copy letters more fully, all patients attending dermatology outpatients at Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham during a week in October 2001 were sent copy letters and later interviewed by telephone using a structured questionnaire that gathered information on content, usage, clarity and perceived usefulness. Direct costs were also calculated. Of 70 patients invited to participate, 59 (85%) could be contacted by telephone at the 2-week follow-up period. Of those 59 patients contacted by telephone, surprisingly only 46 (78%) had actually received a copy letter at 14 days post-consultation. Of the 46 patients receiving a copy letter, 45 (98%) thought the information in the letter was consistent with their consultation; the letter was read a mean number of two times; nine patients (20%) understood most and 36 (78%) all of the letter; 25 (54%) found it useful and a further 21 (46%) found it very useful. Patients' views as to the value in receiving the letter included improved communication, recall and a sense of increased involvement in health care decisions. The direct total cost of sending a copy letter was 25.3 pence per patient. Consultants who participated in the exercise did not perceive any additional difficulties in implementing this practice. This small study found that 100% of patients receiving a copy letter found it useful. The fact that around one-fifth of patients did not receive such copy letters within 2 weeks as intended is worrying, and requires further investigation. Sending a copy letter involves a relatively trivial cost for a practice which patients view as a valuable resource."
2744599	"Skin biopsies and scale extracts from 22 patients with psoriasis were examined for the presence of chemotactic lipoxygenase products of arachidonate metabolism. Heat-stable leukocyte chemotactic activity in aqueous extracts of 2-mm punch biopsies from involved and uninvolved patient skin was significantly elevated, compared to healed psoriatic skin and to skin of normal controls. Ether extracts (pH 3.0) from 13 mg of psoriatic scales contained a mean chemotactic activity corresponding to that of leukotriene B4, 5 X 10(-8) M. On reverse phase high-pressure liquid chromatography, the main chemotactic lipids in scale extracts were leukotriene B4 and 5-HETE. Since lipoxygenase products are potent mediators of inflammation, they may play an important role in the evolution and maintenance of psoriatic lesions."
7904361	"A 41-year-old woman had noticed sclerodactyly for 9 months before consultation. She was diagnosed as having diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis based on the skin sclerosis of her extremities and trunk and assessed by the modified Rodnan skin score method. Her anti-topoisomerase I antibody (anti-topo I) level was 78.1 index (normal range, <   or=16 index). With oral prednisolone treatment, her skin sclerosis gradually improved and disappeared. In parallel, her serum anti-topo I levels became undetectable. Prednisolone was eventually discontinued; however, 10 months after discontinuation, anti-topo I reemerged and increased to 102.1 index, accompanied by newly developed skin sclerosis. Prednisolone was re-started, and the skin sclerosis improved, along with a reduction in anti-topo I levels. Therefore, discontinuation of corticosteroids may have triggered the re-emergence of anti-topo I and skin sclerosis. This case suggests a role for anti-topo I in the pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis and an effect of corticosteroids on skin sclerosis and autoantibody production."
1033233	"Periotest (Medizintechnik Gulden, Modautal, Germany) is a widely accepted implant stability measurement method, although the reliability is not well known. The aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the reliability of the Periotest in implant stability measurements. Thirty implants were placed in 3 cow ribs. The stability of each implant was measured by insertion torque, resonance frequency analyses, and Periotest and then compared. The Periotest values (PTVs) were measured by 4 different examiners. The measurements were repeated twice in both the buccal and mesial directions, for each implant at 2-hour intervals and the intra- and interobserver reliability of Periotest was measured. Results showed that the intraobserver reliability of the Periotest was excellent for the buccal PTVs but fair to poor for the mesial PTVs. The interobserver reliability of the Periotest was excellent for the buccal PTVs but poor for the mesial PTVs. No significance was found between the PTVs and IT values (P = .803) and PTVs and ISQ values, whereas a 47.1% significant correlation was detected between the IT values and ISQ values (P = .009). The present study indicates that only Periotest measurements from buccal result in excellent intra- and interobserver reliability for the quantification of the implant stability."
5638184	"Infantile digital fibromatosis is a rare benign fibromatous tumor characterized by both its location on fingers and toes and its distinctive light microscopic appearance. However, treatment modalities are not yet standardized. Surgical excision had been preferred in the past but has the disadvantage of a high recurrence rate. More recently, isolated instances of spontaneous regression have been reported with a short follow-up. We report four children with infantile digital fibromatosis, who underwent spontaneous regression after clinical monitoring and long-term follow-up. We recommend regular follow-up in order to allow for intervention in case of functional impact on the affected extremities."
8290750	"Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have a greatly increased risk of premature cardiovascular disease. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients have more atherogenic lipid profiles than haemodialysis patients. In this retrospective cohort study, we evaluated whether statin use is associated with improved mortality in incident PD patients.                                                                              The study population included consecutive new PD patients (≥18 years old) from seven PD centres in Korea, between January 2003 and December 2008. The clinical outcome was mortality. A propensity score (PS) comprising demographic, clinical and laboratory variables was used to select a 1:1 matched cohort.                                                                              Statins were prescribed for 37.8% of incident PD patients. Cumulative survival probabilities for statin user versus non-user were 87 versus 80% and 76 versus 69% at 3 and 5 years, respectively (P = 0.01). Statin prescription was associated with a 41% lower adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of death in the unmatched cohort [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.42-0.82; P = 0.002]. The protective effect of statins was also observed in a subgroup analysis of patients with diabetic ESRD (HR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.36-0.80; P = 0.002). After PS matching, the use of statins was also associated with improved survival (HR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.38-0.79; P = 0.001) in incident PD patients.                                                                                      The use of statins was associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality. This association was independent of a history of cardiovascular disease or total cholesterol level. Future randomized clinical trials are warranted to confirm the beneficial effect of statin on PD patients."
7206917	"Negative impact of psoriasis and psoriasis arthritis on quality of life is a central consequence of these diseases. Feelings of stigmatization might, for example, already emerge with only small patches of skin being affected. Empirical data indicate that treating dermatologists should address possible negative effects elicited by problematic encounters with the public and in sexual relationships even if the severity of the disease is low, because lesions on invisible parts of the body can already cause serious adverse impairment. Such psychosocial consequences can be reduced by attending a self-help organization and by taking part in an interdisciplinary patient education program led by dermatologists."
2214541	"To report clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, and treatment outcomes of in kidney transplant recipients who had cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections.                                                                              This retrospective study evaluated the records of kidney transplant recipients followed regularly from 2001 to 2006. In some patients information was also gathered through a telephone call or physical examination. The CMV infection diagnosis was also made by detecting PP.65 antigen per 50,000 peripheral blood leukocytes.                                                                              Of the 200 kidney transplant recipients, 66 were infected with CMV including 42 men and 24 women. The mean patient age was 40 +/- 13 years (range, 14 to 67 years). Seventy-nine percent of the infected patients were diagnosed during the first 6-months after transplantation. All except 22 patients (33%) had constitutional complaints. Fever was present in 65% of patients, abdominal pain in 21%, diarrhea in 20%, and vomiting in 15%. Likewise, pulmonary complaints including cough and dyspnea were reported by 32% and 23%, respectively. However, 20% of patients were completely asymptomatic. Hematologic laboratory data showed anemia (64%), thrombocytopenia (47%), and leukopenia (21%). Seventy eight percent of patients had a serum creatinine <   or=2 mg/dL before infection, but it was <   or=2 in just 26% at the time CMV was diagnosed and 60% after treatment. Antiviral therapy included intravenous gancyclovir in 80% of patients and gancyclovir plus oral acyclovir in 20%. Corticosteroid pulse therapy was also administered in 78% of patients. No statistically significant correlation was observed between CMV antigen load and the severity of clinical manifestations or the time of response to treatment or the recurrence prognosis. In our series, 1 patient died, 28 treated patients (42%) experienced CMV recurrence, and 37 (56%) showed no recurrence.                                                                                      CMV infection should be considered in any renal transplant recipient who has a rise in creatinine even if symptom-free. Despite the results of other studies, we found no prognostic value for the viral antigen load."
7067775	"Infantile hemangioma (IH) may have implications on parental distress and cosmetic disfigurement. To date, ultrapotent corticosteroids are used as a treatment of choice for superficial IH. However, due to their side effects and sometimes lack of IH regression, it is necessary to find alternative topical therapies. Timolol maleate 0.5% solution and gel are nonselective β-blockers that could inhibit proliferation and trigger regression of IH.

The study design was prospective. Two hundred and seventy-eight patients diagnosed as having superficial IH were enrolled from the outpatient clinic of the Department of Dermatology and Venereology, Dr. Sardjito Hospital, Yogyakarta, Indonesia, from January 2009 to December 2014. Patients were divided into three groups: A = treated with topical ultrapotent corticosteroid, B = timolol maleate 0.5% solution and C = timolol maleate 0.5% gel. Patients were followed for 6 months to evaluate the lesion. Lesion size was measured from scaled photodocumentation with the software program ImageJ®.                                                                              There were significant differences in IH size after treatment with timolol maleate 0.5% solution compared with ultrapotent corticosteroids (p <    0.001) and timolol maleate 0.5% gel compared with ultrapotent corticosteroids (p <    0.001). There was no significant difference in IH lesions after treatment with timolol maleate 0.5% solution versus gel (p = 0.744).                                                                                     Timolol maleate 0.5% solution and gel were significantly superior to topical ultrapotent corticosteroids in size reduction of superficial IH."
4896218	The effectiveness of using Vicryl mesh (polyglactin 910) in combination with a Brånemark titanium implant is described. A maxillary central incisor with an apical osseous defect resulting from endodontic failure was treated with the Brånemark method of osseointegration for single tooth replacement. Vicryl mesh was used over the osseous defect site and uncovered 5 months later. New bone formation filling the defect and around the implant was observed.
5967147	"The availability of dense molecular markers has made possible the use of genomic selection in plant and animal breeding. However, models for genomic selection pose several computational and statistical challenges and require specialized computer programs, not always available to the end user and not implemented in standard statistical software yet. The R-package BLR (Bayesian Linear Regression) implements several statistical procedures (e.g., Bayesian Ridge Regression, Bayesian LASSO) in a unifi ed framework that allows including marker genotypes and pedigree data jointly. This article describes the classes of models implemented in the BLR package and illustrates their use through examples. Some challenges faced when applying genomic-enabled selection, such as model choice, evaluation of predictive ability through cross-validation, and choice of hyper-parameters, are also addressed."

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of brodalumab, a human anti-interleukin-17 receptor antibody, in treating patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.                                                                              In this phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (NCT01708590; AMAGINE-1), adult patients in the U.S.A., Canada and Europe were randomized to brodalumab (140 or 210 mg) or placebo every 2 weeks (Q2W), with an additional dose at week 1, for a 12-week induction phase. At week 12, patients receiving brodalumab who achieved static Physician's Global Assessment 0 or 1 (sPGA success) were rerandomized to the placebo or induction dose. After week 16, patients with sPGA ≥ 3 were re-treated with the induction dose. After ≥ 12 weeks of retreatment, patients with sPGA 2 for ≥ 4 weeks or sPGA ≥ 3 were rescued with brodalumab 210 mg Q2W. At week 12, patients randomized to brodalumab with sPGA ≥ 2 or placebo received brodalumab 210 mg Q2W. Coprimary end points were the percentage of patients with ≥ 75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score (PASI 75) and sPGA success at week 12.

8040919	"The bulk of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) in plants is found in the form of conjugated molecules, yet past research on identifying these compounds has largely relied on methods that were both laborious and inefficient. Using recent advances in analytical instrumentation, we have developed a simple yet powerful liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based method for the facile characterization of the small IAA conjugate profile of plants. The method uses the well-known quinolinium ion (m/z 130.0651) generated in MS processes as a signature with high mass accuracy that can be used to screen plant extracts for indolic compounds, including IAA conjugates. We reinvestigated Glycine max (soybean) for its indoles and found indole-3-acetyl-trytophan (IA-Trp) in addition to the already known indole-3-acetyl-aspartic acid (IA-Asp) and indole-3-acetyl-glutamic acid (IA-Glu) conjugates. Surprisingly, several organic acid conjugates of tryptophan were also discovered, many of which have not been reported in planta before. These compounds may have important physiological roles in tryptophan metabolism, which in turn can affect human nutrition. We also demonstrated the general applicability of this method by identifying indolic compounds in different plant tissues of diverse phylogenetic origins. It involves minimal sample preparation but can work in conjunction with sample enrichment techniques. This method enables quick screening of IAA conjugates in both previously characterized as well as uncharacterized species, and facilitates the identification of indolic compounds in general."
1826546	"The maize Opaque2 (O2) protein is a basic leucine zipper transcription factor that controls the expression of distinct classes of endosperm genes through the recognition of different cis-acting elements in their promoters. The O2 target region in the promoter of the alpha-coixin gene was analyzed in detail and shown to comprise two closely adjacent binding sites, named O2u and O2d, which are related in sequence to the GCN4 binding site. Quantitative DNase footprint analysis indicated that O2 binding to alpha-coixin target sites is best described by a cooperative model. Transient expression assays showed that the two adjacent sites act synergistically. This synergy is mediated in part by cooperative DNA binding. In tobacco protoplasts, O2 binding at the O2u site is more important for enhancer activity than is binding at the O2d site, suggesting that the architecture of the O2-DNA complex is important for interaction with the transcriptional machinery."
4825380	"In a number of plant species, downregulation of 4-coumaric acid: coenzyme A ligase (4CL) can reduce lignin content. In lignin precursor (monolignol) biosynthesis during stem wood formation in Populus trichocarpa, two enzymes Ptr4CL3 and Ptr4CL5 catalyze the CoA ligation of 4-coumaric acid to 4-coumaroyl-CoA and caffeic acid to caffeoyl-CoA. CoA ligation of 4-coumaric acid is essential for the 3-hydroxylation of 4-coumaroyl shikimic acid. This hydroxylation results from sequential reactions of 4-hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA: shikimic acid hydroxycinnamoyl transferases (PtrHCT1 and PtrHCT6) and 4-coumaric acid 3-hydroxylase 3 (PtrC3H3). Alternatively, 3-hydroxylation of 4-coumaric acid to caffeic acid may occur through an enzyme complex of cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase 1 and 2 (PtrC4H1 and PtrC4H2) and PtrC3H3. We found that 4-coumaroyl and caffeoyl shikimic acids are inhibitors of Ptr4CL3 and Ptr4CL5. 4-Coumaroyl shikimic acid strongly inhibits formation of 4-coumaroyl-CoA and caffeoyl-CoA. Caffeoyl shikimic acid inhibits only formation of 4-coumaroyl-CoA. 4-coumaroyl and caffeoyl shikimic acids both act as competitive and uncompetitive inhibitors. Estimates of metabolic flux in wildtype and PtrC3H3 downregulated P. trichocarpa transgenics have been made using LC-MS/MS based absolute protein and metabolite quantification, mass action kinetics and inhibition equations. Inhibition by 4-coumaroyl and caffeoyl shikimic acids may play significant regulatory roles when these inhibitors accumulate."

5046469	"Major intrinsic proteins (MIPs) are a family of membrane channels that facilitate the bidirectional transport of water and small uncharged solutes such as glycerol. The 35 full-length members of the MIP family in Arabidopsis are segregated into four structurally homologous subfamilies: plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIPs), tonoplast intrinsic proteins (TIPs), nodulin 26-like intrinsic membrane proteins (NIPs), and small basic intrinsic proteins (SIPs). Computational methods were used to construct structural models of the putative pore regions of various plant MIPs based on homology modeling with the atomic resolution crystal structures of mammalian aquaporin 1 and the bacterial glycerol permease GlpF. Based on comparisons of the narrow selectivity filter regions (the aromatic/Arg [ar/R] filter), the members of the four phylogenetic subfamilies of Arabidopsis MIPs can be classified into eight groups. PIPs possess a uniform ar/R signature characteristic of high water transport aquaporins, whereas TIPs are highly diverse with three separate conserved ar/R regions. NIPs possess two separate conserved ar/R regions, one that is similar to the archetype, soybean (Glycine max) nodulin 26, and another that is characteristic of Arabidopsis NIP6;1. The SIP subfamily possesses two ar/R subgroups, characteristic of either SIP1 or SIP2. Both SIP ar/R residues are divergent from all other MIPs in plants and other kingdoms. Overall, these findings suggest that higher plant MIPs have a common fold but show distinct differences in proposed pore apertures, potential to form hydrogen bonds with transported molecules, and amphiphilicity that likely results in divergent transport selectivities."
1814081	"Modern agricultural systems can benefit from the application of concepts and models from applied ecology. When understood, multitrophic interactions among plants, pests, diseases and their natural enemies can be exploited to increase crop production and reduce undesirable environmental impacts. Although the understanding of subterranean ecology is rudimentary compared to the perspective aboveground, technologies today vastly reduce traditional obstacles to studying cryptic communities. Here we emphasize advantages to integrating as much as possible the use of these methods in order to leverage the information gained from studying communities of soil organisms. PCR-based approaches to identify and quantify species (real time qPCR and next generation sequencing) greatly expand the ability to investigate food web interactions because there is less need for wide taxonomic expertise within research programs. Improved methods to capture and measure volatiles in the soil atmosphere in situ make it possible to detect and study chemical cues that are critical to communication across trophic levels. The application of SADIE to directly assess rather than infer spatial patterns in belowground agroecosystems has improved the ability to characterize relationships between organisms in space and time. We review selected methodology and use of these tools and describe some of the ways they were integrated to study soil food webs in Florida citrus orchards with the goal of developing new biocontrol approaches."
6358576	"We report the results of a consecutive series of patients who underwent autologous (auto) (40), allogeneic (allo) (22) or syngeneic transplantation (2) for multiple myeloma (MM) at our centre. Median age at diagnosis was 45.5 (auto) and 43 (allo) years. Most patients had stage 2 (27% auto; 27% allo) or stage 3 (62% auto; 50% allo) disease and 73% demonstrated chemosensitivity prior to transplant. Median time from diagnosis to transplant was 18.6 months (auto) and 16.4 months (allo). Standard conditioning regimens were used. Median time to neutrophil engraftment was 11 days (7-18) (auto) and 18 days (13-24) (allo) and median time to platelet engraftment was 11 days (6-60) and 18 days (13-105), respectively. Ninety-day mortality was 5% (auto) and 27% (allo). Median follow-up was 15 months (6-48) (auto) and 42 months (24-52) (allo). Three-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 17 +/- 10% (auto) and 22 +/- 9% (allo) and 3-year overall survival (OS) was 74 +/- 11% (auto) and 32 +/- 10% (allo). Autologous transplantation for MM is a safe procedure with good OS although disease progression following transplant is frequent. Allogeneic transplantation has a high procedure-related mortality and PFS comparable to autologous transplantation but OS is poor. The early mortality and high OS of autologous transplantation in MM compares favourably with both the results of allogeneic transplantation and published results of standard therapy in this retrospective analysis."
4486294	"Peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) were mobilised by recombinant human G-CSF (rhG-CSF) and cyclophosphamide, harvested by apheresis from 9 patients with NHL and stored at 4 degrees C without further manipulation. They were then reinfused after high-dose chemotherapy. We monitored the change in colony-forming units-granulocyte, macrophage (CFU-GM) proliferation as well as plasma glucose, lactate and pH levels over the period of the study. In an attempt to maintain CFU-GM numbers, rhG-CSF was added to storage bags at collection and 48 h later. Our observations suggest that cell viability is well maintained and that CFU-GM numbers rise over the first 48 h of storage before falling rapidly. Metabolic changes cause a fall in the pH and glucose levels with a reciprocal rise in plasma lactate. The addition of rhG-CSF at a concentration of 10 ng/ml to cells in storage showed no detectable benefit. Following storage for 96 h, 77% (SEM +/- 8%) of the initial CFU-GM remained."
8789174	"Prostaglandins, especially prostaglandin E synthetase (PGE2), influence carcinogenesis by promoting cell proliferation, inhibiting apoptosis, stimulating angiogenesis and mediating immune suppression. Cyclooxygenase-2, coded by the PTGS2 gene, is the key enzyme in the production of prostaglandins. In melanoma, Cox-2 is over expressed in primary malignant melanoma (MM) and in their corresponding metastases. Polymorphisms in the promoter region of PTGS2 gene can modulate gene expression and could modify individual susceptibility to MM. Two hundred and forty melanoma patients and 342 controls were genotyped for polymorphisms -765G>   C (rs20417) and -1195A>   G (rs689466). Allele -765C frequency was significantly higher in melanoma patients. No allele frequency differences for -1195A>   G polymorphism were observed. Haplotype analysis revealed that the haplotypes carrying the minor alleles were associated to a higher risk of melanoma (P = 0.02). Expression analysis showed that allele -765C is associated to a higher gene expression and could represent a risk allele by affecting the functionality of the promoter."

We analyzed data from the 20 institutions of the Pediatric Heart Transplant Study Group, from January 1, 1993, through December 31, 1998, using actuarial and parametric survival analysis and competing outcomes analysis.                                                                              During the 6 years studied, 1,234 patients were listed for cardiac transplantation; 262 patients (21.2%) had unpalliated HLHS. The number (and percentage) of patients with HLHS decreased from 58 (27% of patients listed) in 1993 to 30 (14%) in 1998. Overall, 25% of infants with HLHS died while waiting; primary cause of death was cardiac failure (50%). Of the remaining patients awaiting transplantation, 23 (9%) underwent Norwood/Fontan-type surgeries as interim palliation: 52% died. Ultimately, 175 patients underwent cardiac transplantation (67%); 50% received organs by 2 months after listing. Post-transplant actuarial survival was 72% at 5 years, with 76% of deaths (35/46) occurring within 3 months; early mortality was caused primarily by graft failure within the first 30 days after transplantation (in 54%). Among 1-month survivors, survival at 1 and at 5 years was 92% and 85%, respectively. Of the 262 patients listed with unpalliated HLHS, overall survival, taking into account mortality after listing and after transplantation, was 68% at 3 months and 54% at 5 years.

4447070	"Donor hypernatremia was reported to cause postoperative graft dysfunction in human orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). However, the effects of the correction of donor hypernatremia before organ procurement have not been confirmed. The aim of this study is to determine whether donor hypernatremia is associated with early graft dysfunction after OLT and to determine the effect of the correction of donor hypernatremia. One hundred eighty-one consecutive OLTs performed between May 1997 and July 1998 were entered onto this study. The cases were divided into three groups according to the donor serum sodium concentration: group A, serum sodium of 155 mEq/L or less before organ procurement (n = 118); group B, peak sodium greater than 155 mEq/L and final sodium 155 mEq/L or less (n = 36); and group C, final sodium greater than 155 mEq/L (n = 27). Graft survival within 90 days after OLT and early postoperative graft function were analyzed. There were no significant differences in donor and recipient variables among the three groups. The frequencies of graft loss were 15 of 118 grafts (12.7%) in group A, 4 of 36 grafts (11.1%) in group B, and 9 of 27 grafts (33.3%; P <   .05 v groups A and B) in group C. The liver enzyme values in groups B and C were significantly greater than those in group A postoperatively. The prothrombin times of group C were significantly longer than those of group A for the first 4 postoperative days. Recipients of hepatic allografts from donors with uncorrected hypernatremia had a significantly greater incidence of graft loss compared with recipients of hepatic allografts from normonatremic donors. However, the differences in graft survival were abrogated by the correction of donor hypernatremia before procurement."
8750753	"In this issue, Genders et al. (2015) demonstrate in a cohort of organ transplant recipients that betapapillomavirus seropositivity around transplantation significantly increases the risk of developing keratinocyte carcinomas. These results further substantiate an etiologic role of betapapillomaviruses in skin cancer and raise prospects of anti-viral immunotherapy."
9405279	"Systemic lupus erytematosus (SLE) is characterized by the presence of various autoantibodies and the deposition of immune complexes which are cleared by Fcgamma receptors.                                                                                   Family-based association analysis was performed to investigate whether the FCGR3A-72S/R and FCGR3A-270T/R polymorphisms are risk factors for SLE in a Chinese population.                                                                              In total, 119 patients with SLE from 95 nuclear families, aged 14-78 years, who met the American College of Rheumatology 1997 criteria were recruited, as were 316 family members of these patients. We studied two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) encoding nonsynonymous substitution in the FCGR3A gene with respect to genetic susceptibility to SLE in a collection of 435 subjects from 95 nuclear families. We performed the genotyping using PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism.                                                                              Our results showed that FCGR3A-72R/S have an excess of transmission of the R allele from heterozygous parents to affected offspring (transmission disequilibrium test chi2 = 9.30, P = 0.0032). Univariate (single-marker) family-based association tests demonstrated that a variant allele at SNP rs403016 of the FCGR3A gene was significantly associated with genetic susceptibility to SLE (exon 3, Z = 2.5444, P = 0.01097) in an additive model. The R and S allele frequencies were 39.4% and 60.6%, respectively. The frequencies of FCGR3A 72R/R, R/S and SS genotypes were 9.1%, 60.6% and 30.3%, respectively. However, the FCGR3A-270T/S SNP was not found in this Chinese population.                                                                                     This study suggests a linkage disequilibrium of the FCGR3A-72R/S SNP with SLE, and supports the notion that a novel polymorphism of the FCGR3A-72R/S SNP is associated with genetic susceptibility to SLE in Chinese populations."
3526184	"A previous study indicated that a single application of 4% dimeticone liquid gel was effective in treating head louse infestation. This study was designed to confirm this in comparison with two applications of 1% permethrin.                                                                              We have performed a single centre parallel group, randomised, controlled, open label, community based trial, with domiciliary visits, in Cambridgeshire, UK. Treatments were allocated through sealed instructions derived from a computer generated list. We enrolled 90 children and adults with confirmed head louse infestation analysed by intention to treat (80 per-protocol after 4 drop outs and 6 non-compliant). The comparison was between 4% dimeticone liquid gel applied once for 15 minutes and 1% permethrin creme rinse applied for 10 minutes, repeated after 7 days as per manufacturer's directions. Evaluated by elimination of louse infestation after completion of treatment application regimen.                                                                              Intention to treat comparison of a single dimeticone liquid gel treatment with two of permethrin gave success for 30/43 (69.8%) of the dimeticone liquid gel group and 7/47 (14.9%) of the permethrin creme rinse group (OR 13.19, 95% CI 4.69 to 37.07) (p <    0.001). Per protocol results were similar with 27/35 (77.1%) success for dimeticone versus 7/45 (15.6%) for permethrin. Analyses by household gave essentially similar outcomes.                                                                                      The study showed one 15 minute application of 4% dimeticone liquid gel was superior to two applications of 1% permethrin creme rinse (p <    0.001). The low efficacy of permethrin suggests it should be withdrawn.                                                                                            Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN88144046."
5598461	"Immune-mediated subepidermal bullous dermatoses characterized by in vivo-bound linear IgG deposition at the cutaneous basement membrane zone include bullous pemphigoid, ocular cicatricial pemphigoid, anti-bullous pemphigoid antigen mucosal pemphigoid, anti-epiligrim mucosal pemphigoid, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, and the bullous eruption of systemic lupus erythematosus. In this article, we describe a novel IgG-mediated bullous dermatosis.                                                                                   Clinically, a unique nonscarring dermatosis was characterized by the sudden onset of extensive bullae and erosions on mucous membrane and skin, resembling toxic epidermal necrolysis or pemphigus vulgaris. Histologically, the patient's skin lesion demonstrated neutrophilic papillary dermal infiltration and subepidermal blister formation, resembling dermatitis herpetiformis. Immunopathologically, there was linear IgG and C3 deposition at the skin basement membrane zone. The patient responded well to prednisone and azathioprine immunosuppression and has achieved a lasting remission without further therapy. Further immunologic investigations revealed that this unique dermatosis is distinct from all other known IgG-mediated subepidermal bullous dermatoses.                                                                                      This novel deep lamina lucida pemphigoid can be distinctly termed anti-p105 pemphigoid on the basis of antigenic specificity of the autoantibodies. Although this novel dermatosis resembles toxic epidermal necrolysis clinically, prudent use of diagnostic immunofluorescence studies can clearly delineate its immunologic nature. Prompt recognition of this unique dermatosis and timely initiation of appropriate immunosuppressive therapy could be life-saving for those patients suffering from this dermatosis."
6888560	"Individuals with PHACE syndrome (posterior fossa malformations, hemangiomas, arterial anomalies, cardiac defects, eye abnormalities, sternal cleft, and supraumbilical raphe syndrome) have reported dental abnormalities to their healthcare providers and in online forums, but dental involvement has not been comprehensively studied. A study was conducted at the third PHACE Family Conference, held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July 2012. A pediatric dentist examined subjects at enrollment. Eighteen subjects were enrolled. The median age was 4.2 years (range 9 mos-9 yrs; 14 girls, 4 boys). Eleven of 18 patients had intraoral hemangiomas and five of these (50%) had hypomature enamel hypoplasia. None of the seven patients without intraoral hemangiomas had enamel hypoplasia. No other dental abnormalities were seen. Enamel hypoplasia may be a feature of PHACE syndrome when an intraoral hemangioma is present. Enamel hypoplasia increases the risk of caries, and clinicians should refer children with PHACE syndrome to a pediatric dentist by 1 year of age."
8569964	"A novel member of the WRKY gene family, designated TcWRKY53, was isolated from a cadmium (Cd)-treated Thlaspi caerulescens cDNA library by differential screening. WRKY proteins specifically bind to W-boxes, which are found in the promoters of many genes involved in defense and response to environmental stress. TcWRKY53 contains a 975-bp open reading frame encoding a putative protein of 324 amino acids. Homology searches showed that TcWRKY53 resembles similar WRKY domain-containing proteins from rice, parsley and tobacco, especially AtWRKY53 from Arabidopsis thaliana. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR showed that the expression of TcWRKY53 was strongly induced by various environmental stresses, including an excess of NaCl, drought, cold and the signal molecule salicylic acid (SA). The expression of TcWRKY53 in response to NaCl, drought and cold suggested a possible role of TcWRKY53 in abiotic stress response. However, physiological tests indicated that the expression of TcWRKY53 in tobaccos decreases tolerance to sorbitol during seedling root development. This was consistent with PEG6000 treatment of tobacco seedlings, and together these results indicate a negative modulation of TcWRKY53 in response to osmotic stress. Furthermore, two ethylene responsive factor (ERF) family genes, NtERF5 and NtEREBP-1, were negatively induced in TcWRKY53-overexpressing transgenic plants. In contrast, a LEA family gene, NtLEA5, showed no change, suggesting that TcWRKY53 might regulate the plant osmotic stress response by interacting with an ERF-type transcription factor rather than by regulating function genes directly."
7261229	"The current classification schemes of adnexal tumours are predominantly based on morphological and immunophenotypical similarities to adult skin structures, whereas a link between the embryology of the skin and the histogenesis of adnexal tumours has been largely neglected.                                                                                  To describe the expression patterns of two proteins with proven relevance for hair follicle homeostasis (SOX9 and β-catenin) during human cutaneous embryogenesis and to compare the findings with their expression in basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and pilomatrixoma.                                                                              Immunohistochemical evaluation with monoclonal antibodies against SOX9 and β-catenin was carried out in embryonic and adult human scalp skin, and BCC and pilomatrixoma samples.                                                                              We found that the expression patterns of SOX9 and β-catenin during human hair follicle embryogenesis mirror the patterns in BCC and pilomatrixoma in spatial distribution within the various follicular subcompartments. Beginning with the hair peg stage, nucleocytoplasmic immunoreactivity of β-catenin is exclusively confined to the emerging matrix (comparable to pilomatrixoma), whereas SOX9 is restricted to the primordial outer root sheath (comparable to BCC).                                                                                        An appropriate immunophenotyping validated within the conceptual framework of cutaneous developmental biology allows a logical classification of adnexal neoplasms. Expanding this approach further has the potential to revise the current classification schemes so that not only BCC and pilomatrixoma but all adnexal tumours can be categorized logically."
6031217	"Human papilloma virus (HPV) is known to be an etiologic agent for benign warts of the skin. Recently, HPV have been detected in malignant skin and mucosal diseases suggesting that HPV infection can induce malignant skin tumors. In the present study, we examined the presence of mucosal HPV DNA in normal tissue, Bowen's disease (BD), Bowenoid papulosis (BP) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin. We detected the HPV DNA with polymerase chain reactions, and identified the type by DNA sequencing. In the results, we detected HPV DNA in none of the 17 normal controls, two of the three BP (66.7%), one of the 21 BD (4.8%), and six of the 26 SCC of the skin samples (23.0%). The occurrence rates of HPV in BP and SCC were significantly elevated compared to that of normal controls (P <    0.01 and P <    0.01, respectively). In addition, the occurrence rate of HPV in BP was significantly elevated compared to that of BD (P <    0.05). The reproducibility was confirmed with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with another primer pair. Of the two cases of BP with positive HPV DNA, one case showed HPV 31 and the other case HPV 16. The case of BD with positive HPV DNA showed HPV 31. Of the six cases of SCC with positive HPV DNA, one case showed HPV 16, another case HPV 34, and the other four cases HPV 31. These results showed that mucosal HPV, including HPV 31 and 16, could be detected in SSC of the skin. Mucosal HPV, not only the epidermodysplasia verruciformis type, appear to induce malignant skin tumors."
6270070	"Molecular pathology is rapidly evolving, featuring continuous technologic improvements that offer novel clinical opportunities for the recognition of disease predisposition, for identifying sub-clinical disease, for more accurate diagnosis, for selecting efficacious and non-toxic therapy, and for monitoring of disease outcome. Currently, the identification and prognosis of primary cutaneous melanoma is based on histologic factors (tumor depth and ulceration) and clinical factors (number of lymph node and/or distant metastases). However, metastasis can occur in patients with thin melanomas, and sentinel lymph node biopsy does not identify all patients at risk for distant metastasis. New markers exist that correlate with melanoma progression, which may aid in melanoma identification, prognostication, and detection of minimal residual disease/early recurrence. Moreover, not many therapeutic options exist for melanoma as no regimen prolongs survival. Emerging data with investigational therapies suggest that certain markers might play a crucial role in identifying patients who will respond to therapy or show utility in the monitoring the response to therapy. Herein, molecular diagnostics that can potentially benefit the individual melanoma patient will be discussed."

Data were collected from medical records and dental radiographic findings of patients who received dental implant therapy along with a sinus elevation procedure at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital from June 2003 to December 2008.                                                                              A total of 338 sinus elevation cases (643 implants) were included in this study, out of which maxillary sinusitis was reported in 33 cases (9.8%). The type of surgical approach used and the occurrence of sinus membrane perforation could be considered factors affecting maxillary sinusitis associated with the sinus elevation procedure. The implants at the site of the maxillary sinusitis associated with the sinus elevation procedure showed lower survival rates in male patients. Better clinical outcomes were achieved in the group receiving combined medical and surgical therapy for sinusitis associated with the sinus elevation procedure.                                                                                      Postoperative maxillary sinusitis decreased the survival rates of implants, whereas early diagnosis and combined medical and surgical therapy had the opposite effect."
4960688	"Electrical stimulation is being used in variable skin therapeutic conditions. There have been clinical studies demonstrating the positive effect of electrical stimuli on hair regrowth. However, the underlying exact mechanism and optimal parameter settings are not clarified yet. To investigate the effects of different parameter settings of electrical stimuli on hair growth by examining changes in human dermal papilla cells (hDPCs) in vitro and by observing molecular changes in animal tissue. In vitro, cultured hDPCs were electrically stimulated with different parameter settings at alternating current (AC). Cell proliferation was measured by MTT assay. The Ki67 expression was measured by immunofluorescence. Hair growth-related gene expressions were measured by RT-PCR. In animal model, different parameter settings of AC were applied to the shaved dorsal skin of rabbit for 8 weeks. Expression of hair-related genes in the skin of rabbit was examined by RT-PCR. At low voltage power (3.5 V) and low frequency (1 or 2 MHz) with AC, in vitro proliferation of hDPCs was successfully induced. A significant increase in Wnt/β-catenin, Ki67, p-ERK and p-AKT expressions was observed under the aforementioned settings. In animal model, hair regrowth was observed in the entire stimulated areas under individual conditions. Expression of hair-related genes in the skin significantly increased on the 6th week of treatment. There are optimal conditions for electrical stimulated hair growth, and they might be different in the cells, animals and human tissues. Electrical stimuli induce mechanisms such as the activation of Wnt/β-catenin and MAPK pathway in hair follicles."
7693812	"Apparently, these days psoriasis is regarded as a systemic disease with frequent cardiovascular comorbidities, such as hypertension, myocardial infarction, valvular defects etc., which may lead to reduced lifespan or even sudden death. Therefore, it is important that biomarkers helpful in early detection or prediction of cardiovascular complications as well as their prevention should be identified. Even though the N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is a well-known cardiovascular predictor in cardiovascular (CV) patients and in the general population, its usefulness in detection of CV comorbidities in psoriatic patients is still unclear.                                                                                  The aim of the study was to determine whether the N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) concentration was increased in psoriatic patients.                                                                              The study included 73 psoriatic patients and 45 age-matched healthy individuals. The serum NT pro-BNP concentration as well as lipid profile parameters were assessed in the study and control groups. Correlations between patients' clinical data, their serum NT-proBNP and lipid concentrations were calculated.                                                                              The serum concentration of NT-proBNP was significantly higher in psoriatic patients (109.22 ± 172.59 pg/mL) in comparison with controls (35.82 ± 22.90 pg/mL) (P = 0.000054). In 28 (38.36%) psoriatic patients the lipid profile was within normal limits, whereas in 45 (61.64%) psoriatic patients triglyceride and/or total cholesterol were increased. Moreover, in both psoriatic groups, i.e. normo- and hyperlipidaemic, NT-proBNP concentrations were significantly higher compared to normo- and hyperlipidaemic controls, P = 0.02 and P = 0.001 respectively. A positive correlation was found between the NT-proBNP concentration and duration of psoriasis (P <    0.05).                                                                                      The study findings confirmed higher NT-proBNP concentrations in psoriatic patients, which could be a useful biomarker of CV disease in both normo- and hyperlipidaemic groups."
5725597	"Dithranol (anthralin) has been known to be effective in the treatment of psoriasis for more than 80 years. However, perilesional and uninvolved skin often show irritation during dithranol treatment, which limits its use. As the relapse rate of psoriasis is worsened by adding corticosteroids to a dithranol regimen, the use of topical corticosteroids to reduce dithranol irritation is controversial.                                                                                   The aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical and cell biological effect of clobetasol-17-propionate 0.05% ointment on dithranol-treated lesional and perilesional skin.                                                                              For 17 consecutive days, 2% dithranol cream was applied on two test sites. A third site was left untreated on all participating patients (n = 8). All sites consisted of a psoriasis lesion as well as a 3-cm zone of perilesional skin localized on the back. After 1 h, the cream was washed off, and subsequently one of the dithranol-treated sites was treated once a day with clobetasol-17-propionate 0.05% ointment. The second site was treated once daily with the vehicle. On day 17, punch biopsies were taken from all three lesions and from the perilesional zone of all test sites in order to perform an immunohistochemical investigation, using markers to assess proliferation, differentiation and inflammation.                                                                              The SUM score (erythema + induration + scaling) of the lesion treated with dithranol/clobetasol showed a pronounced reduction, which was significantly greater than the SUM score of the lesion treated with dithranol/vehicle. However, the scores of both sites were equal by 6 weeks of follow-up. Comparing the two treated lesions, we observed a lower number of cycling epidermal cells in the dithranol/clobetasol lesion and a significantly lower perivascular dermal score of T lymphocytes. Comparing the perilesional skin of the two treated sites we observed less cycling epidermal cells in the dithranol/clobetasol-treated site. Regarding perilesional differentiation, the interpapillary involucrin expression was higher in the dithranol/clobetasol-treated site. With respect to perilesional inflammation the expression of dermal polymorphonuclear leucocytes, monocytes, macrophages and T lymphocytes in the dermal infiltrate were significantly lower in the dithranol/clobetasol-treated site.                                                                                      The addition of clobetasol-17-propionate enhanced the antipsoriatic efficacy of dithranol by interfering with T-cell accumulation and epidermal proliferation. The addition of a corticosteroid reduced perilesional dithranol inflammation at the cellular level, although clinically detectable dithranol erythema was not reduced."
5617922	"Bazex-Dupré-Christol syndrome (BDCS) is an X-linked dominantly inherited disorder affecting hair follicle structures. Currently, hypotrichosis, follicular atrophoderma and basal cell carcinomas are considered frequent symptoms of the disorder whereas milia are supposed to reflect infrequent clinical signs. Usually, basal cell carcinomas in this disease manifest from the second decade of life onwards.                                                                                  Here, we studied a novel multigeneration family of German origin with BDCS. Interestingly, two family members developed pigmented basal cell carcinomas in early childhood, at the age of 3 and 5 years, respectively. The differentiation from other pigmented lesions was accomplished by both dermoscopy and histopathology. A thorough survey of the current literature revealed that milia were present in almost all patients with BDCS reported, as is the case in our family.                                                                                      We suggest that milia should also be considered frequent symptoms in BDCS. For the first time, to the best of our knowledge, we describe the occurrence of pigmented basal cell carcinomas in BDCS during the first decade of life. Our observation emphasizes the importance of screening for cutaneous malignancies in this disorder already at young age."

Sociodemographic patient characteristics, medical data and scores of several validated questionnaires regarding quality of life (Dermatology Life Quality Index) and sexual health (Sexual Quality of Life Questionnaire for use in Men, International Index of Erectile Function, Female Sexual Distress Scale and Female Sexual Function Index) were collected and analysed.                                                                              This study (n = 487) shows that psoriasis has a detrimental effect on quality of life and sexual health. Patients with genital lesions reported even significantly worse quality of life than patients without genital lesions (mean ± SD quality of life scores 8·5 ± 6·5 vs. 5·5 ± 4·6, respectively, P <    0·0001). Sexual distress and dysfunction are particularly prominent in women (reported by 37·7% and 48·7% of the female patients, respectively). Sexual distress is especially high when genital skin is affected (mean ± SD sexual distress score in patients with genital lesions 16·1 ± 12·1 vs. 10·1 ± 9·7 in patients without genital lesions, P = 0·001). The attention given to possible sexual problems in the psoriasis population by healthcare professionals is perceived as insufficient by patients.                                                                                      In addition to quality of life, sexual health is diminished in a considerable number of patients with psoriasis and particularly women with genital lesions have on average high levels of sexual distress. We underscore the need for physicians to pay attention to the impact of psoriasis on psychosocial and sexual health when treating patients for this skin disease."
3011684	"Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum (PXE) is an autosomal recessive, multisystem disorder affecting connective tissues. We describe three cases of the acquired PXE-like syndrome that often occurs in association with hemolytic anemias, in particular the hemoglobinopathies, and review the literature on the subject. The pathogenesis of the acquired PXE-like lesions is not yet completely understood. None of the mutations observed in the inherited form has been detected in the syndrome accompanying thalassemia. The cardiovascular complications could be life-threatening. Therefore, an close surveillance of these patients is mandatory."
4148936	"Our previously published study showed promising results of autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in patients with primary resistant Hodgkin's disease (HD). Probabilities of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) at 3 years were 55 and 36%, respectively. The present study was undertaken to compare these results with conventionally treated patients and thus evaluate therapeutic options. Retrospective data on 76 adult patients who underwent ASCT were matched with 76 conventionally treated patients from 17 centers. Comparison of clinical characteristics in both groups showed that ASCT patients were younger (24 vs 31.5 years, P=0.001), more frequently presented with 'B' symptoms (P=0.03) and that more patients treated with chemotherapy (CT) had elevated LDH (P=0.03). In univariate analyses, bulky disease (P=0.0043) and complete resistance to standard CT (P=0.051) were found to be risk factors for OS. In a multivariate survival analysis only bulky disease was found to an independent prognostic factor (P=0.005). There was no difference in survival between the treatment groups with 5 years OS 33.7 (CI: 23-46) in the ASCT group and 35.6% (CI: 25-50) for the CT group (P=0.92). We conclude that ASCT is not superior to standard CT for treatment of patients with primary refractory HD."
1872346	"The conquest of the land by plants required dramatic morphological and metabolic adaptations. Complex developmental programs under tight regulation evolved during this process. Key regulators of plant development are phytohormones, such as cytokinins. Cytokinins are adenine derivatives that affect various processes in plants. The cytokinin signal transduction system, which is mediated via a multistep variant of the bacterial two-component signaling system, is well characterized in the model plant Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). To understand the origin and evolutionary pattern of this signaling pathway, we surveyed the genomes of several sequenced key plant species ranging from unicellular algae, moss, and lycophytes, to higher land plants, including Arabidopsis and rice (Oryza sativa), for proteins involved in cytokinin signal transduction. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the hormone-binding receptor and a class of negative regulators first appeared in land plants. Other components of the signaling pathway were present in all species investigated. Furthermore, we found that the receptors evolved under different evolutionary constraints from the other components of the pathway: The number of receptors remained fairly constant, while the other protein families expanded."
1494339	"Adenylyl cyclases (ACs) are enzymes that generate cyclic AMP, which is involved in different physiological and developmental processes in a number of organisms. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of a new plant adenylyl cyclases (AC) gene, designated HpAC1, from Hippeastrum x hybridum. This gene encodes a protein of 206 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 23 kD and an isoelectric point of 5.07. The predicted amino acid sequence contains all the typical features of and shows high identity with putative plant ACs. The purified, recombinant HpAC1 is able to convert ATP to cAMP. The complementation test that was performed to analyze the ability of HpAC1 to compensate for the AC deficiency in the Escherichia coli SP850 strain revealed that HpAC1 functions as an adenylyl cyclase and produces cyclic AMP. Moreover, it was shown that the transcript level of HpAC1 and cyclic AMP concentration changed during certain stress conditions. Both mechanical damage and Phoma narcissi infection lead to two sharp increases in HpAC1 mRNA levels during a 72-h test cycle. Changes in intracellular cAMP level were also observed. These results may indicate the participation of a cAMP-dependent pathway both in rapid and systemic reactions induced after disruption of symplast and apoplast continuity."
1405927	"Nearly half a century ago insect herbivores were found to induce the formation of green islands by manipulating cytokinin (CK) levels. However, the response of the CK pathway to attack by chewing insect herbivores remains unclear. Here, we characterize the CK pathway of Nicotiana attenuata (Torr. ex S. Wats.) and its response to wounding and perception of herbivore-associated molecular patterns (HAMPs). We identified 44 genes involved in CK biosynthesis, inactivation, degradation, and signaling. Leaf wounding rapidly induced transcriptional changes in multiple genes throughout the pathway, as well as in the levels of CKs, including isopentenyladenosine and cis-zeatin riboside; perception of HAMPs present in the oral secretions (OS) of the specialist herbivore Manduca sexta amplified these responses. The jasmonate pathway, which triggers many herbivore-induced processes, was not required for these HAMP-triggered changes, but rather suppressed the CK responses. Interestingly CK pathway changes were observed also in systemic leaves in response to wounding and OS application indicating a role of CKs in mediating long distance systemic processes in response to herbivory. Since wounding and grasshopper OS elicited similar accumulations of CKs in Arabidopsis thaliana L., we propose that CKs are integral components of wounding and HAMP-triggered responses in many plant species."
4314272	"Extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1) was first identified in 1994 as an 85-kDa glycoprotein secreted by a mouse osteogenic stromal cell line. Subsequently, the human homologue has been found to regulate endochondral bone formation, and to stimulate proliferation of endothelial cells and induce angiogenesis. However, a role for ECM1 in skin physiology and homeostasis has also emerged. Specifically, in 2002, loss-of-function mutations in the ECM1 gene were discovered to be the cause of the rare autosomal recessive genodermatosis, lipoid proteinosis. This inherited disorder is characterized clinically by skin and mucosal infiltration and scarring and histologically by disruption/duplication of basement membrane and widespread deposition of hyaline material in the dermis. Moreover, other recent studies have identified circulating autoantibodies against the ECM1 protein in most patients with lichen sclerosus, a common chronic inflammatory condition that shares some clinicopathological features with lipoid proteinosis. ECM1 thus serves as a target antigen in both an inherited and an acquired skin disorder. Within the epidermis, ECM1 has a role in the control of keratinocyte differentiation. Within the dermis, ECM1 binds to the major heparan sulphate proteoglycan, perlecan. In this way, ECM1 may act as a ""biological glue"" in the dermis, helping to regulate basement membrane and interstitial collagen fibril macro-assembly and growth factor binding. ECM1 may also have a role in other acquired skin disorders and physiological skin changes including scarring, wound healing and skin ageing, although this remains to be determined."
8493547	"The expression of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in leprosy skin lesions was examined before and during successful treatment in a patient with borderline lepromatous leprosy. Before treatment, immunohistochemical staining of a skin biopsy specimen showed diffuse TNF-alpha deposits in granulomas and significant TNF-alpha deposits on infiltrated mononuclear cells. After 1 year's treatment, the skin lesions exhibited a reduction in granulomas, and a concomitant reduction in deposits of TNF-alpha. Furthermore, the level of expression of TNF-alpha messenger RNA, as examined using a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction method, was reduced markedly after treatment. These findings provide evidence for a correlation between the expression of TNF-alpha and disease activity suggesting that TNF-alpha is a useful prognostic indicator for inflammation in leprosy."
5422718	"Exogenously applied H2O2 (50, 100 and 200mM) to Mesembryanthemum crystallinum root medium induced a transition from C3 to Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM), as evaluated by diurnal malate (Δmal) fluctuations. A very high concentration of H2O2 (400mM) reduced Δmal below the value measured in control plants. An increase of malate content during the night in 400mM H2O2-treated plants might suggest that malate decarboxylation is crucial for CAM functioning. We conclude that malate plays a dual role: i) a protective and signaling function before CAM expression, and ii) a storage form of CO2 in plants performing CAM. A slight stimulation of photosystem II (PSII) photochemistry and net photosynthesis observed during the C3-CAM shift indicated that neither photoinhibition nor reduction of the photosynthetic rate were prerequisites for CAM. Moreover, CAM induction corresponded to a decrease of catalase activity. In CAM-performing plants, α-tocopherol, polyamines (putrescine and spermidine) and proline showed daily alterations and the content of α-tocopherol and polyamines was lower at the end of the day. In contrast, the proline concentration correlated with the applied H2O2 concentration and was higher at the end of the day in treated plants. The dynamic changes of antioxidant and osmolyte levels suggest their active role in preventing oxidative damage, stress acclimation mechanisms and involvement in metabolic regulation and/or signal transduction cascades."
2263958	"Since higher plants regularly release organic compounds into the environment, their decay products are often added to the soil matrix and a few have been reported as agents of plant-plant interactions. These compounds, active against higher plants, typically suppress seed germination, cause injury to root growth and other meristems, and inhibit seedling growth. Mucuna pruriens is an example of a successful cover crop with several highly active secondary chemical agents that are produced by its seeds, leaves and roots. The main phytotoxic compound encountered is the non-protein amino acid L-DOPA, which is used in treating the symptoms of Parkinson disease. In plants, L-DOPA is a precursor of many alkaloids, catecholamines, and melanin and is released from Mucuna into soils, inhibiting the growth of nearby plant species. This mini-review summarizes knowledge regarding L-DOPA in plants, providing a brief overview about its metabolic actions."

This study evaluates to improve periosteal expansion osteogenesis (PEO) using a shape memory alloy mesh (SMA) device with decortication in a rabbit model.                                                                                            The SMA device was inserted under the periosteum at the forehead and pushed, bent, and attached to the bone surface and fixed with a titanium screw. Twelve rabbits were divided into two groups: PEO without decortication (P group) and with decortication (D group). After 2 weeks, the screw was removed, and the mesh was activated by its own elasticity. Rabbits were sacrificed 5 (P1/D1) and 8 (P2/D2) weeks after operation and histologically and radiographically evaluated.                                                                              The mean activation height was 2.9 ± 0.5 mm. The ratio of new bone volume in the elevated volume was 17.6% in P1, 59.8% in D1 33.4% in P2, and 65.1% in D2. D group had a statistically higher volume of new bone than P group during each period (p <    .05).                                                                                     PEO with decortication appears to be a promising clinical alternative for bone augmentation and introduces the new concept of ""dynamic graft and guided bone regeneration (GBR)."""
2524581	"Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity, isoenzyme pattern, and expression of two genes encoding subunit A and of three genes encoding subunit B have been investigated in the scutellum of germinating maize (Zea mays L.) seeds. Four SDH isoforms were detected electrophoretically and by ion-exchange chromatography at the peak of activity of the glyoxylate cycle (on the 4th and 5th day of germination), while in dry seeds and on the 8th and 9th day of germination only two isoforms were present, which can be related to differential expression of the genes encoding SDH subunits. The levels of transcription of Sdh1-1, Sdh1-2, Sdh2-1, Sdh2-2 and Sdh2-3 and the intensity of methylation of their promoters have been determined. In the course of seed germination, the level of methylation of the promoters of one gene encoding subunit A (Sdh1-1) and of two genes encoding subunit B (Sdh2-1 and Sdh2-2) changed from low to the highest, which resulted in suppression of their transcription during the period when the intensity of the glyoxylate cycle was decreasing, while methylation of the promoter of Sdh2-3 did not change and expression of this gene was constitutive during germination. Methylation of the promoter of Sdh1-2 increased but less sharply as compared to Sdh1-1. It is suggested that epigenetic mechanisms of SDH expression via methylation of promoters play an important role in the regulation of transcription of Sdh1-1, Sdh2-1 and Sdh2-2 in maize seeds during germination. These genes may play a role in the provision of operation of the glyoxylate cycle, while Sdh1-2 and Sdh2-3 are involved mainly in the respiratory processes that are not connected with utilization of succinate formed in the glyoxylate cycle."
1127285	"Polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein (PGIP) is a cell wall-associated protein that specifically binds to and inhibits the activity of fungal endopolygalacturonases. The Phaseolus vulgaris gene encoding PGIP has been cloned and characterized. Using a fragment of the cloned pgip gene as a probe in Northern blot experiments, it is demonstrated that the pgip mRNA accumulates in suspension-cultured bean cells following addition of elicitor-active oligogalacturonides or fungal glucan to the medium. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for PGIP were generated against a synthetic peptide designed from the N-terminal region of PGIP; the antigenicity of the peptide was enhanced by coupling to KLH. Using the antibodies and the cloned pgip gene fragment as probes in Western and Northern blot experiments, respectively, it is shown that the levels of PGIP and its mRNA are increased in P. vulgaris hypocotyls in response to wounding or treatment with salicylic acid. Using gold-labeled goat-anti-rabbit secondary antibodies in EM studies, it has also been demonstrated that, in bean hypocotyls infected with Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, the level of PGIP preferentially increases in those cells immediately surrounding the infection site. The data support the hypothesis that synthesis of PGIP constitutes an active defense mechanism of plants that is elicited by signal molecules known to induce plant defense genes."
3397620	"We examined the prevalence of depression (measured by the Carroll Rating Scale for Depression, CRSD), wishes to be dead and acute suicidal ideation among 480 patients with dermatological disorders that may be cosmetically disfiguring, i.e. non-cystic facial acne (n = 72; 5.6% suicidal ideation), alopecia areata (n = 45; 0% suicidal ideation), atopic dermatitis (n = 146; 2.1% suicidal ideation) and psoriasis (79 outpatients, 2.5% suicidal ideation and 138 inpatients, 7.2% suicidal ideation). Analysis of variance revealed that the severely affected psoriasis inpatients (mean +/- SD total body surface area affected: 52 +/- 23.4%) had the highest (P <    0.05) CRSD score, followed by the patients with mild to moderate acne; both scores were in the range for clinical depression (CRSD score >    10). The 5.6-7.2% prevalence of active suicidal ideation among the psoriasis and acne patients was higher than the 2.4-3.3% prevalence reported among general medical patients. Our findings highlight the importance of recognizing psychiatric comorbidity, especially depression, among dermatology patients and indicate that in some instances even clinically mild to moderate disease such as non-cystic facial acne can be associated with significant depression and suicidal ideation."
2014344	"Cutaneous leishmanisis (CL) is a common disease in Iran, particularly in Kerman and Bam and Kerman province. Lymphadenitis resulting from leishmania tropica (dry type) with, or without, cutaneous lesion is rare. Localized leishmanial lymphadenitis (LLA) is a specific clinico-pathologic presentation of inflammatory changes caused by leishmanial parasites or antigen within an isolated lymph node without any systemic manifestation.                                                                                  A 55-year-old Iranian woman presented with two slow growing large nodules (masses) on the left preauricular and the left cervical areas. The nodules were large, painless, mobile, multilobulated, and associated with a small skin papule on the left-side of the cheek distal to the masses.                                                                              Histopathologic examination of both the skin lesion and the lymph nodes suggested the leishmanial etiology of skin papule and lymphadenitis. The Leishman-bodies (amastigotes) were demonstrated in two lymph nodes and a skin lesion. The clinical picture plus pathological finding and the response to meglumine-antimoniate confirmed LLA.

Ninety patients of constitutional POM were enrolled for 12 weeks. The patients were distributed into three groups. One-third of patients underwent 3-weekly GA peel, another one-third underwent 3-weekly lactic peel, and rest applied vitamin C daily. Clinical improvement was assessed objectively using POM grading. Patient's and physicians global assessment along with patient's global tolerance was also evaluated.                                                                              More than 50% improvement in POM was observed in 73.34% of patients on GA peel, 56.67% on lactic peel, and 26.67% on vitamin C. On comparing improvement with respect to duration of therapy, GA peel was significantly more effective than lactic peel from 12 weeks onward, while it was more effective than vitamin C from 6 weeks onward. Lactic peel was more effective than vitamin C from 6 weeks onward. Physician and patient global assessment was excellent with glycolic peel followed by lactic peel and vitamin C. The incidence of adverse effect was maximum with GA peel followed by lactic peel and vitamin C.

In the lesion of male melasma, there was a significant increase of stem cell factor and c-kit expression. In addition, the lesion to nonlesion ratio of stem cell factor was increased in male melasma compared with female melasma and lentigo groups. The lesion to nonlesion ratio of c-kit was also increased in male melasma compared with lentigo groups.

Our results show that IMQ application at mid and late telogen activated hair follicle stem cells leading to premature hair cycle entry (anagen), which was accompanied by massive infiltration of inflammatory macrophages and gamma delta T cells, whereas the number of the respective resident populations decreased. Interestingly, high resident macrophage numbers were present in Rag2     -/-       mice and were maintained after IMQ treatment explaining why IMQ-induced anagen was reduced. This could be rescued after macrophage depletion suggesting that resident macrophages inhibit whereas inflammatory infiltrating macrophages stimulate hair follicle stem cell activation. The expression of the anagen-inhibiting factor BMP-4 was reduced by IMQ treatment as well as the activating factors Wnt showing that IMQ-induced hair follicle stem cell activation occurs by a Wnt-independent mechanism involving inflammatory cytokines such as CCL2 and TNF-α. On the basis of our findings, we recommend conducting experiments with IMQ during mid and late telogen as the biggest differences in immune cell composition are observed."
9228324	"Previous works have shown that extracts obtained from Ageratina pichinchensis are capable of reducing the time needed for wounds to heal. By means of a randomized, double-blind pilot study, the objective of this work was to evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of a phytopharmaceutical developed with a standardized extract (5 %, cream formulation) of A. pichinchensis, topically administered in patients with diabetic foot ulcer. Micronized silver sulfadiazine (1 %) was employed as a control treatment. Treatments were randomly assigned to each patient, and clinical evolution was evaluated weekly until complete healing of the wound. All patients who concluded the study achieved complete healing of their ulcers. After six weeks of treatment, patients in the experimental group exhibited a wound-healing process of 77.5 %, while that of patients in the control group was 69.8 %. A statistically significant difference was not found between groups. The average time needed for complete wound healing was 65.47 ± 47.08 days for patients treated with the A. pichinchensis extract and 77.46 ± 50.8 days for patients in the control group (p = 0.509). There was no case in either of the groups in which adverse side effects were identified. Thus, it was concluded that the A. pichinchensis extract showed the ability to improve the healing process in patients with diabetic foot ulcer; however, no statistically significant differences were observed when compared with results obtained in patients administered the control treatment (micronized silver sulfadiazine). Some limitations of this study must be addressed, such as small sample size. This work comprises a pilot study that could be useful in a future clinical trial with a greater number of patients."
7849869	"Levels of the cytokines IL-6, IL-1alpha, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) are significantly higher in lesional than in non-lesional skin of patients with vitiligo. However, how cytokines affect pigmentation is not fully understood. To examine the mechanism, Western blot analysis with TNF-alpha, Fas ligand (FasL), and downstream signaling molecules such as I-kappaB, NF-kappaB, TNF-R1-associated factor 2, Akt, and PTEN (phosphatase and tension homologue) were performed for the suction-blistered depigmented and normally pigmented epidermis from 10 patients. Levels of TNF-alpha and FasL were significantly higher in the depigmented epidermis. Interestingly, phosphorylation levels of I-kappaB, NF-kappaB, and Akt were lower in the depigmented epidermis. Moreover, PTEN, which could inhibit the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) signaling pathway, was significantly higher in depigmented epidermis, implying that vitiliginous keratinocytes may be more susceptible to TNF-alpha-mediated apoptosis through impaired Akt and NF-kappaB activation. To test this hypothesis, cultured normal human keratinocytes were treated with TNF-alpha in the presence of a PI3K inhibitor to suppress Akt activation. Keratinocytes showing impaired Akt activation demonstrated increased apoptosis with less activation of NF-kappaB. Thus, reduced activation of NF-kappaB via impaired PI3K/Akt activation under increased TNF-alpha levels could result in increased apoptosis of vitiliginous keratinocytes."
3368500	"Irritant contact dermatitis may be induced by many chemicals and has a far greater incidence than allergic contact dermatitis. Despite this, it receives relatively little attention and its pathogenesis remains poorly understood. To gain a greater understanding of the interaction of irritants with the skin, we investigated the histopathological changes resulting from the topical application of a series of structurally unrelated irritants. Human volunteers were patch-tested with appropriate concentrations of nonanoic acid, sodium lauryl sulphate, dithranol, benzalkonium chloride, croton oil, and propylene glycol, which produced generally mild to moderate responses. Biopsy specimens were taken after 48 h and examined by light and electron microscopy. Spongiosis and the infiltration of predominantly mononuclear cells were observed in the epidermis of the majority of biopsy specimens, and were particularly pronounced and extensive in croton oil reactions. In addition, several irritants induced distinct and characteristic patterns of keratinocyte damage. Nonanoic acid and sodium lauryl sulphate caused morphologic changes indicative of disturbances in keratinocyte metabolism and differentiation, giving rise to dyskeratosis and parakeratosis respectively, while dithranol induced marked swelling of keratinocytes in the upper epidermis. The results suggest that there is a diversity and specificity in the histopathology of irritant contact dermatitis, reflecting the different ways in which chemicals may interact with components of the skin."
9856923	"As the neuropeptide substance P can manipulate murine hair growth in vivo, we here further studied the role of sensory neuropeptides in hair follicle biology by determining the distribution and hair-cycle-dependent remodeling of the sensory innervation in C57BL/6 mouse back skin. Calcitonin-gene-related peptide, substance P, and peptide histidine methionine (employed as vasoactive intestinal peptide marker) were identified by immunohistochemistry. All of these markers immunolocalized to bundles of nerve fibers and to single nerve fibers, with distinct distribution patterns and major hair-cycle-associated changes. In the epidermis and around the distal hair follicle and the arrector pili muscle, only calcitonin-gene-related peptide immunoreactive nerve fibers were visualized, whereas substance P and peptide histidine methionine immunoreactive nerve fibers were largely restricted to the dermis and subcutis. Compared to telogen skin, the number of calcitonin-gene-related peptide, substance P, and peptide histidine methionine immunoreactive single nerve fibers increased significantly (p <    0.01) during anagen, including around the bulge region (the seat of epithelial stem cells). Substance P significantly accelerated anagen progression in murine skin organ culture, whereas calcitonin-gene-related peptide and a substance-P-inhibitory peptide inhibited anagen (p <    0.05). The inhibitory effect of calcitonin-gene-related peptide could be antagonized by coadministrating substance P. In contrast to substance P, calcitonin-gene-related peptide failed to induce anagen when released from subcutaneous implants. This might reflect a differential functional assignment of the neuropeptides calcitonin-gene-related peptide and substance P in hair growth control, and invites the use of neuropeptide receptor agonists and antagonists as novel pharmacologic tools for therapeutic hair growth manipulation."
7842774	"A 38-year-old woman complained of recurrent nodules on her anterior chest wall. She noticed the first nodule at the age of 12 and has since undergone surgical removal a total of 31 times. Finally, wide resection of parts of the rib cartilage and sternum and chest wall reconstruction were required. Histopathological examination of a series of surgical specimens were reevaluated. Immunohistochemical staining of the tumors by anti-CD34 antibody provided a definite diagnosis of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP). A noteworthy result was that her DFSP did not always express CD34; the recurrent tumors with myxoid and fibrosarcomatous changes lost their CD34 expression."

1936346	"Interleukin (IL)-15 is a pleiotropic cytokine known to be involved in graft rejection and to serve as a survival factor for leukocytes and epithelial cells, including renal cells. It utilizes a heterotrimeric receptor complex that consists of the IL-2 receptor betagammac subunits (IL-2/15Rbetagammac) and a unique high-affinity alpha-chain responsible for IL-15 specificity.                                                                              The cDNA of IL-15Ralpha main mRNA product was isolated from primary human tubular epithelial cells (TEC) and sequenced. IL-15R expression in TEC and in murine renal tissue was demonstrated using western blotting, ligand binding and flow cytometry. TEC were activated with combinations of IL-15, IL-2 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and mRNA and protein levels of IL-15R were determined. Jak-STAT tyrosine phosphorylation was assayed following IL-15 exposure.                                                                              The full-length alpha-chain mRNA bearing exons 1-7 is expressed in TEC. IL-15Ralpha protein was detected on intact cells by flow cytometry and in extracts of human and mice renal cells using a specific anti-IL-15Ralpha antibody and by ligand-binding assay. The three subunits of the IL-15R were similarly expressed in cortex and medulla of mice kidney. Stimulation of TEC with IFN-gamma upregulated the alpha-chain while IL-2 and IL-15 had no effect on its expression. A short IL-15 stimulation of TEC induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the main IL-15 signalling molecules (Jak-1, Jak-3, STAT-3 and STAT-5).                                                                                      Our data demonstrate the presence of a functional IL-15 receptor in the kidney. Since renal cells produce IL-15, this cytokine may have an autocrine/paracrine regulatory role in the kidney."
7215900	"The serine-threonine protein kinase gene, designated pkv (protein kinase- viroid induced) was previously found to be transcriptionally activated in tomato plants infected with the plant pathogen Potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd). These plants exhibited symptoms of stunting, and abnormal development of leaf, root, and vascular tissues. The encoded protein, PKV, is a novel member of the AGC VIIIa group of signal-transducing protein kinases; however, the role of PKV in plant development is unknown. In this communication, we report the phenotypic results of over expression and silencing of pkv in transgenic tobacco.                                                                              Over expression of pkv in Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi (tobacco) resulted in stunting, reduced root formation, and delay in flowering, phenotypes similar to symptoms of PSTVd infection of tomato. In addition, homozygous T2 tobacco plants over expressing PKV were male sterile. Antisense expression of pkv, on the other hand, resulted in plants that were taller than non-transformed plants, produced an increased number of flowers, and were fertile. Exogenous application of GA3 stimulated stem elongation in the stunted, sense-expressing plants. PKV sense and antisense expression altered transcript levels of GA biosynthetic genes and genes involved in developmental and signaling pathways, but not genes involved in salicylic acid- or jasmonic acid-dependent pathways. Our data provide evidence suggesting that PKV plays an important role in a GA signaling pathway that controls plant height and fertility.                                                                                     We have found that the over expression of the tomato protein kinase PKV resulted in stunting, modified vascular tissue development, reduced root formation, and male sterility in tobacco, and we propose that PKV regulates plant development by functioning in critical signaling pathways involved in gibberellic acid metabolism."
4356884	"Arabidopsis shoot meristem activity is regulated by a molecular network involving the participation of several components, including SHOOTMERISTEMLESS (STM), CLAVATA1 (CLV1), and ZWILLE (ZLL). In an effort to identify the role of these genes during in vitro shoot formation Brassica and Arabidopsis plants were transformed with the Brassica napus (Bn) STM, CLV1, ZLL1 and ZLL2 identified in previous work [1]. In both systems shoot organogenesis was promoted by the over-expression of BnSTM, BnZLL1, and BnZLL2, and repressed by the over-expression of BnCLV1. This distinct regulation, analogous to that occurring during in vivo meristem formation where STM and ZLL encourage stem cell formation while CLV1 accelerates transition to differentiation, suggests similar regulatory mechanisms governing shoot formation in vivo and in vitro. While the BnZLL1 and BnZLL2 induction of shoot organogenesis correlated only to changes in auxin signaling, BnSTM and BnCLV1 evoked major transcriptional alterations in cytokinin response. Besides increasing the transcript levels of two cytokinin receptors, ARABIDOPSIS HISTIDINE KINASE4 (AHK4) and CYTOKININ INDEPENDENT KINASE (CKI1), ectopic expression of BnSTM induced Type-B ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATORS (ARRs) and repressed Type-A ARRs. Opposite transcriptional patterns occurred in explants over-expressing BnCLV1, characterized by a decreased ability to produce shoots. The role played by Type-A and Type-B ARRs during shoot organogenesis was further examined using a genetic approach which revealed the requirement of ARR12 for the BnSTM positive regulation of shoot organogenesis. Collectively these results expand our knowledge on the function of meristem genes, and provide new tools for enhancing in vitro propagation systems."
3193295	"Solitary mastocytoma is known to occur predominantly in children below 2 years of age and onset in adulthood is rare. Lesions are hyperpigmented in the majority of cases owing to the stimulation of melanin synthesis by mast cell growth factor. We hereby report two patients with adult onset solitary mastocytoma presenting as hypopigmented plaque. The first case was a 24-year-old man who presented with a plaque on the back of the neck of 5 years duration. The second case was a 30-year-old man who had a well-defined solitary, oval 3 x 2.5 cm plaque on the nape of the neck. Stroking of lesion resulted in a wheal with flare (Darier's sign) in both cases. Systemic examination was within normal limits in both cases. Histopathology revealed a dense toluidine blue-positive infiltrate of mast cells in the upper dermis in both cases."
5955746	"Abstract Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as a field of medicine has been subject to rapid development and evolution since its inception. Traditionally, HSCT has been used for therapy of a diverse group of malignancies, bone marrow failure states, and inherited disorders. The rapid evolution of transplantation technology coupled with the diverse outcomes associated with a heterogeneous group of patients has stymied the development of consensus over objective programmatic indicators of quality, especially as they pertain to outcomes. In some regard, the lack of consensus has caused transplant programs to respond to a more consumer-driven paradigm of evaluation. The community of providers of transplantation therapies has responded by establishing standards for accreditation of facilities and uniform presentation of programmatic data. Rapid acceptance of the need for meaningful quality programs to address all aspects of the transplant facility has moved HSCT to the forefront of implementing standards for medical practice. Because definition of optimal outcomes in HSCT is likely to remain elusive, it is imperative that providers involved with HSCT continue to take a leadership role in defining program quality through further research."
5684009	"The perennial trees, in contrast to the much more studied annual plants, have to adapt their vegetative growth and development to the sometimes extremely contrasting environmental conditions that occur over the different seasons. Recently, studies of the molecular framework underlying this adaptation in Populus trees is reinforcing the notion that the genetic pathways controlling growth and dormancy cycles have a remarkable conservation with the pathways controlling the regulation of flowering time in annual plants. Insight into these mechanisms will be important for our understanding of how trees will respond to various future global climate scenarios."
9369686	"In 1903, Niels Ryberg Finsen was awarded the Nobel Prize for his invention of light therapy for skin tuberculosis (lupus vulgaris). The mechanism of action has not been shown; thus, we wanted to elucidate the mechanism of Finsen's light therapy. We measured radiation that could be transmitted through his lens systems and absorption of the stain solution filters in the lamps, and related the obtained results to the possible biological effects on Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Judged from transmission characteristics all tested lens systems were glass lenses (absorbing wavelength <    340 nm). The tested filters likewise absorbed wavelengths <    340 nm. The methylene blue solution used to absorb heat, blocked out wavelengths below 340 nm and between 550 and 700 nm. Furthermore, fluorescence of M. tuberculosis indicated the presence of porphyrins and HPLC analysis of sonicated M. marinum showed that coproporphyrin III was present, which highly justified that porphyrins were present in M. tuberculosis. Production of singlet oxygen through radiation of porphyrins with light of e.g. 400 nm seems to be a most plausible explanation why Finsen's therapy worked in spite of the lack of shortwave ultraviolet radiation, which Finsen believed was the most effective radiation for treating skin tuberculosis."
3619736	"Albino hairless mice (SkH:HR-1) exposed chronically to suberythemal doses of ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation display visible skin wrinkling and tumors. Topical treatment of mice with solutions of conjugated dienes (2,4-hexadien-1-ol and derivatives of it) prior to each UVB radiation exposure reduces significantly the severity of these visible alterations. Chronic suberythemal doses of ultraviolet A radiation induce skin sagging, a distinctly different visible skin alteration. The severity of skin sagging is not reduced by topical application of the conjugated dienes tested here."
9619774	"UV radiation is a well-known inducer of epidermal pigmentation that is utilized in therapy for vitiligo, one of the skin depigmentation disorders. Although it has been reported that melanocyte stem cells (McSCs) play essential roles in hair pigmentation, the relationship between McSCs and epidermal pigmentation remains unclear. Repetitive UVB irradiation on the dorsal skin of F1 mice of HR-1 × HR/De caused apparent epidermal pigmentation, and it was characterized by increase in the number of melanocytes. Interestingly, differentiation of McSCs into melanoblasts in hair follicles was followed by induction of epidermal melanocyte differentiation. Administration of a neutralizing antibody for Kit receptor that depletes resident melanoblasts could not suppress increased number of melanocytes. UVB irradiation also induced robust expression of Wnt7a as well as Kitl in epidermis, and β-catenin translocation into nucleus in McSCs. Intradermal injection of IWR-1 (inhibitor of Wnt response 1), a chemical inhibitor of β-catenin activation, and small interfering RNA (siRNA) against Wnt7a suppressed increase in the number of epidermal melanocytes. Taken altogether, it was demonstrated that Wnt7a triggered McSCs differentiation through β-catenin activation, and Kitl might induce following migration of melanoblasts to epidermis. These findings will help in developing therapeutic technologies for vitiligo and other pigmentary disorders."
3645362	"Expansins are cell wall proteins that induce pH-dependent wall extension and stress relaxation in a characteristic and unique manner. Two families of expansins are known, named alpha- and beta-expansins, and they comprise large multigene families whose members show diverse organ-, tissue- and cell-specific expression patterns. Other genes that bear distant sequence similarity to expansins are also represented in the sequence databases, but their biological and biochemical functions have not yet been uncovered. Expansin appears to weaken glucan-glucan binding, but its detailed mechanism of action is not well established. The biological roles of expansins are diverse, but can be related to the action of expansins to loosen cell walls, for example during cell enlargement, fruit softening, pollen tube and root hair growth, and abscission. Expansin-like proteins have also been identified in bacteria and fungi, where they may aid microbial invasion of the plant body."
2001426	"Widely-spread cadmium (Cd) pollution in the soil threatens both crop production and human health. How plants deal with the excess Cd are largely unknown. To evaluate the molecular mechanism by which plants respond to Cd stress, rice seedlings were treated with two concentrations of Cd and subjected to deep RNA sequencing. Comprehensive RNA-Seq analysis of rice roots under two gradients of Cd treatment revealed 1169 Cd toxicity-responsive genes. These genes were involved in the reactive oxygen species scavenging system, stress response, cell wall formation, ion transport, and signal transduction. Nine out of 93 predicted long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were detected as Cd-responsive lncRNAs due to their high correlation with the Cd stress response. In addition, we analyzed alternative splicing (AS) events under different Cd concentrations. Four hundred and seventy-six differential alternatively spliced genes with 542 aberrant splicing events were identified. GO analysis indicated that these genes were highly enriched in oxidation reduction and cellular response to chemical stimulus. Real-time qRT-PCR validation analysis strengthened the reliability of our RNA-Seq results. The results suggest that post-transcriptional AS regulation may also be involved in plant responses to high Cd stress."
8157604	"We report our experience with laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (LDN) compared with open donor nephrectomy (ODN). Prognostic factors associated with adverse outcomes in LDN were identified.                                                                              From January 2000 to December 2009, 243 consecutive live-donor nephrectomies were performed, including 129 LDNs and 114 ODNs. We compared patient demographics, perioperative outcomes, and recipient graft function in each group. Prognostic factors for adverse outcomes in LDN were investigated using uni- and multivariate analyses.                                                                              Patient demographics, except mean donor age (P=.032), were similar between groups. Mean operative time (219 vs 163 minutes; P<   .001) and warm ischemia time (WIT; 3.1 vs 1.7 minutes; P<   .001) were significantly longer in LDN. Conversely, mean analgesic requirement (9.2 vs 14.7 mg morphine; P<   .001) and postoperative hospital stay (6.5 vs 7.1 days; P=.003) were significantly lower with LDN. Mean estimated blood loss (EBL) was slightly lower in LDN (P=.15). There were 7 conversions from LDN to ODN. Complication rates were similar between the groups (P=.38). Delayed graft function (10.9% vs 1.7%; P=.016) and mean serum creatinine level at 1 month (1.47 vs 1.3 mg/dL; P=.04) were higher for LDN. However, 5-year allograft survival was not inferior among LDN (90% vs 85%; P=.42). Mean operative time (268 to 175 minutes; P<   .001), EBL (316 to 66 mL; P<   .001), and complication incidence (8 to 0 cases; P<   .002) gradually decreased from the initial 43 cases to the last 43 cases of LDNs. Among surgeons who had performed-30 LDNs, the mean operative time and WIT were 197 mL and 2.8 minutes, respectively.                                                                                      Based on our evidence, LDN was a feasible and safe surgical option for live-donor nephrectomy, even in a small volume center. Better results can be achieved after a learning curve of experience for both the surgeon and the institution."
3727102	"There is increasing evidence for widespread occurrences of infection with Epidermodysplasia verruciformis-related human papillomaviruses, both in the general population and in immunosuppressed patients. In order to test for the prevalence of antibodies directed against the native L1 epitopes exposed on the surface of the virions, we have established an IgG-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with L1 virus-like particles of the Epidermodysplasia verruciformis-specific human papillomavirus 8 as antigen to screen 567 representative serum samples from the general population and immunosuppressed/dermatologic patients. Among healthy European donors (n = 210), 7.6% were found to be seropositive. In a group of renal transplant recipients (n = 185) the antibody prevalence was elevated to 21.1%, irrespective of the presence or absence of skin cancer. High positivity rates could be detected among (i) immunocompetent patients with nonmelanoma skin tumors (45.6%, n = 79) and (ii) Psoralene/UVA treated psoriasis patients (42.9%, n = 42). In contrast, anti-human papillomavirus 8-virus-like particle antibodies were found in only 6.8% of Hodgkin lymphoma patients (n = 44)."

Histologic examination of the plaque revealed a thinner keratin layer, increased pigmentation, and a pilosebaceous unit with a visible vellus hair. We tentatively hypothesize from this single case that a disruption in the normal sequence of events of morphogenesis, and particularly in dorsal-to-ventral orientation, may have occurred in this patient."
8012435	"Hepatic veno-occlusive disease, also called sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (VOD/SOS), is an unpredictable and potentially fatal complication of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) or nontransplantation-associated chemotherapy/radiotherapy. In cases of severe hepatic VOD/SOS, typically defined by associated multiorgan failure (MOF, also known as multiorgan dysfunction), mortality exceeds 80%. Preclinical and early clinical data have provided a rationale for defibrotide treatment in hepatic VOD/SOS. Based on this evidence and in recognition of the dismal prognosis for these patients, defibrotide was made available through an international multicenter compassionate-use program conducted from December 1998 to March 2009. Physicians participating in the program voluntarily provided demographic and outcome data for patients given defibrotide. Efficacy and safety analyses were performed using the data received for 710 treated patients. Defibrotide was given at 10, 25, 40, 60, or 80 mg/kg/day for a median of 15 days (range, 1 to 119 days). By Kaplan-Meier analysis, the estimated overall day +100 survival was 54% (58% in the 25 mg/kg/day dose group). Adverse events (AEs) were reported in 53% of patients. The most common AEs were MOF, progression of hepatic VOD/SOS, sepsis, and graft-versus-host disease, which were consistent with the AEs expected for this patient population. No clinically meaningful trends in AEs were identified by gender, age, or dose group. Safety and efficacy resultswere consistent with prior studies of defibrotide in hepatic VOD/SOS, and subgroup analyses lend support to the use of the 25 mg/kg/day dose."
4633647	"Chronic T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR) in kidney graft is characterized by reduction of the vessel lumen with marked intimal thickening, fibrous hyperplasia of the small renal arteries and leukocyte infiltrates. The aim of this study was to find specific gene expression profiles in chronic TCMR kidney biopsies.                                                                              RNA extracted from archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded renal biopsies was used for gene expression profiling. Our study included 14 patients with chronic TCMR and 10 with acute TCMR. Fifty-two cadaveric donors were used as controls. The results were validated in an independent set of kidney biopsies.                                                                              We identified 616 and 243 differentially expressed genes with a fold change ≥1.5 and a false discovery rate <   0.05 in chronic and acute TCMR, respectively. Pathway analysis revealed upregulation of OX40 signalling. This pathway is involved in the generation of CD8     +       effector memory T cells and the upregulation of killer cell lectin-like receptor G1 (KLRG-1), B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (BLIMP-1) and CD25, which characterize CD8     +       effector memory T cells. However, the enhanced OX40 signalling pathway was specific to chronic TCMR; a significant increase of KLRG-1     +      /CD8     +       and BLIMP-1     +      /CD8     +       was only detected in these specimens.                                                                                      These results suggest the involvement of memory-committed CD8     +       effector T cells in chronic TCMR. The generation of effector memory T cells is mediated by the OX40 gene pathway, and could be considered a future target for the specific treatment of chronic TCMR."

8136971	"Renal transplantation (RTx) is considered as the best therapeutic modality for patient suffering from end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Dearth of donor kidneys is a major problem everywhere, and deceased donor renal transplantation (DDRTx) is seen as at least a partial solution. Even so, DDRTx accounts for only less than 4% of RTx in India. We report our 6-year single-center experience on DDRTx vis-à-vis patient/graft survival, graft function in terms of serum creatinine (SCr), rejection episodes, and delayed graft function (DGF). Between January 2005 and March 2011, 236 DDRTx were performed. Majority of the donors were those with brain death due to road traffic/cerebrovascular accidents. The commonest recipient diseases leading to ESRD were chronic glomerulonephritis (42.8%), diabetes (12.7%), and hypertension (10.6%). Mean recipient age was 36.2 ± 14.2 years; 162 were males and 74 were females. Mean donor age was 45.3 ± 17.13 years; 144 were males and 92 were females. Mean dialysis duration pre-transplantation was 18.5 ± 2.5 months. All recipients received single-dose rabbit-anti-thymocyte globulin induction and steroids, calcinueurin inhibitor, and mycophenolate mofetil/azathioprine for maintenance immunosuppression. Delayed graft function was observed in 29.6% patients and 22% had biopsy-proven acute rejection. Over the mean follow-up of 2.18 ± 1.75 years, patient and graft survival rates were 74.57% and 86.8%, respectively, with mean SCr of 1.42 ± 0.66 mg%. DDRTx achieves acceptable graft function with patient/graft survival, encouraging the use of this approach in view of organ shortage."
6718426	"It is well known that abscisic acid (ABA) antagonizes gibberellin (GA)-promoted seed germination. Recent circumstantial evidence suggests that salicylic acid (SA) also inhibits seed germination in maize and Arabidopsis. Our study shows that SA blocks barley seed germination in a dosage dependent manner. As an initial effort to addressing the mechanism controlling the crosstalk of SA, GA and ABA signaling in barley, we studied the regulation of alpha-amylases by SA and a WRKY gene whose expression is modulated by these hormones. Assays of alpha-amylase activity reveal that GA-induced alpha-amylase production in aleurone cells is inhibited by bioactive SA, but not its analogs, 3-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid. This inhibitory effect is unlikely due to repressing alpha-amylase secretion or inhibiting alpha-amylase enzyme activities. Northern blot analyses indicate that SA suppresses GA-induced expression of a barley low pI alpha-amylase gene (Amy32b). Because our previous data indicate that ABA-inducible and GA-suppressible WRKY genes inhibit the expression of alpha-amylase genes in rice, we studied the steady state mRNA levels of a barley WRKY gene, HvWRKY38. The expression of HvWRKY38 in barley aleurone cells is down-regulated by GA, but up-regulated by SA and ABA. However, the regulation of HvWRKY38 by SA appears to be different from that of ABA in term of the kinetics and levels of induction. Over-expression of HvWRKY38 in aleurone cells by particle bombardment blocks GA induction of the Amy32b promoter reporter construct (Amy32b-GUS). Therefore, HvWRKY38 might serve as a converging node of SA and ABA signal pathways involved in suppressing GA-induced seed germination."
7769306	"Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) has been associated with high mortality, but recent anecdotal survival appeared better. From 1988 to 2010, the NAPRTCS registry had 235 registered PTLD cases. We sent a special 25-point questionnaire study to the NAPRTCS centers with the most recent 150 cases to obtain additional follow-up data not collected in the master registry, our objective being to determine the recent outcomes after PTLD and determine prognostic factors. We received 92 completed responses, in which only 12 (13%) deaths were reported, 2 from nonmedical causes, 10 with a functioning graft. Kaplan-Meier-calculated patient survival was 90.6% at 1 year and 87.4% at 3, 4 and 5 years post-PTLD. Graft survival post-PTLD was 81.8% at 1 year, 68.0% at 3 years and 65.0% at 5 years. Seven patients received a retransplant after PTLD, with no PTLD recurrence reported. Using all 235 PTLD cases, the covariates associated with better patient survival were more recent year of PTLD diagnosis (adjusted hazard ratio AHR 0.86, p <    0.001), and with worse survival were late PTLD (AHR 1.98, p = 0.0176) and patient age above 13 at PTLD (AHR 3.43, p value 0.022). In children with kidney transplants, patient survival has improved with more recent PTLDs."

A 33-year-old male presented with brown discolouration of the fingernails following the application of 4% hydroquinone in sorbolene cream and 0.1% tretinoin cream to the face intermittently for 9 months. The discolouration resolved when the creams were ceased.
4410767	"This report focuses on application of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) carrying phycomolecule ligands as a novel plant growth promoter aimed at increasing the crop productivity. The present investigation examined the effect of ZnONPs on plant growth characteristics, and associated biochemical changes in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) following growth in a range of concentrations (25-200 mg L     -l       ZnONPs) in combination with 100 mM P in a hydroponic system. Treated plants registered an increase in growth and total biomass by 130.6% and 131%, respectively, over control. Results demonstrated a significant increase in the level of chlorophyll a (141.6%), b (134.7%), carotenoids (138.6%), and total soluble protein contents (179.4%); at the same time, a significant reduction (68%) in the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) in leaves with respect to control. Interestingly, a significant increase in superoxide dismutase (SOD, 264.2%), and peroxidase (POX, 182.8%) enzyme activities followed by a decrease in the catalase (CAT) activity, in response to above treatments. These results suggest that bioengineered ZnONPs interact with meristematic cells triggering biochemical pathways conducive to an accumulation of biomass. Further investigations will map out the mode of action involved in growth promotion."

An acute hemolytic crisis developed and he died. The association of autoimmune hemolytic anemia and vitilligo should be looked for in other cases. Until more information is available, patients with vitiligo and thrombocytopenia should not be treated with psoralens and exposure to ultraviolet light."
7160856	"The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical characteristics of patients with adverse cutaneous drug reactions, which occur when a medicinal product results in cutaneous morbidity.                                                                              The study included 308 patients who were diagnosed as having an adverse cutaneous drug reaction during the study period (2007-2009). In 84 cases, histopathologic examination of skin biopsies were also performed.                                                                              Patients with drug reactions were found to be more commonly female (63%) than male (37%). Beta-lactam antibiotics were found to be the most frequent cause of adverse cutaneous drug reactions (42.7%), followed by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (16.5%). Acute urticaria was the most common clinical presentation (59.2%) followed by fixed drug eruptions (18.5%), and maculopapular eruptions (14.9%).                                                                                     Adverse cutaneous drug reactions in our study population were mainly induced by beta-lactam antibiotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The most common forms of cutaneous adverse drug reactions were found to be acute urticaria, fixed drug eruptions, and maculopapular rashes."
5814148	"Flagellate skin lesions occur in some patients after eating the mushroom Lentinus edodes, and they are called shiitake dermatitis in Japan. We describe a 44-year-old man with such skin lesions on his trunk after eating L. edodes, who developed as well photosensitive skin lesions on exposed areas. Skin phototesting with UVB did not show a decreased minimum erythema dose; UVA irradiation provoked an erythematous lesion with nonspecific histological changes. Analysis of the case histories of 94 Japanese patients with shiitake dermatitis revealed that 44 (47%) also developed dermatitis on the skin exposed to sunlight. UVA photodermatitis has not been emphasized in previous reports. The relationship to bleomycin flagellate dermatitis is discussed."
3249757	"The major immunological hurdle to successful porcine-to-human xenotransplantation is the acute vascular rejection (AVR), characterized by endothelial cell (EC) activation and perturbation of coagulation. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and its derivatives have anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory effects and protect against reactive oxygen species, rendering HO-1 a promising molecule to control AVR. Here, we report the production and characterization of pigs transgenic for human heme oxygenase-1 (hHO-1) and demonstrate significant protection in porcine kidneys against xenograft rejection in ex vivo perfusion with human blood and transgenic porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAEC) in a TNF-α-mediated apoptosis assay.                                                                              Transgenic and non-transgenic PAEC were tested in a TNF-α-mediated apoptosis assay. Expression of adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin) was measured by real-time PCR. hHO-1 transgenic porcine kidneys were perfused with pooled and diluted human AB blood in an ex vivo perfusion circuit. MHC class-II up-regulation after induction with IFN-γ was compared between wild-type and hHO-1 transgenic PAEC.                                                                              Cloned hHO-1 transgenic pigs expressed hHO-1 in heart, kidney, liver, and in cultured ECs and fibroblasts. hHO-1 transgenic PAEC were protected against TNF-α-mediated apoptosis. Real-time PCR revealed reduced expression of adhesion molecules like ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin. These effects could be abrogated by the incubation of transgenic PAECs with the specific HO-1 inhibitor zinc protoporphorine IX (Zn(II)PPIX, 20 μm). IFN-γ induced up-regulation of MHC class-II molecules was significantly reduced in PAECs from hHO-1 transgenic pigs. hHO-1 transgenic porcine kidneys could successfully be perfused with diluted human AB-pooled blood for a maximum of 240 min (with and without C1 inh), while in wild-type kidneys, blood flow ceased after ∼60 min. Elevated levels of d-Dimer and TAT were detected, but no significant consumption of fibrinogen and antithrombin was determined. Microthrombi could not be detected histologically.                                                                                      These results are encouraging and warrant further studies on the biological function of heme oxygenase-I expression in hHO-1 transgenic pigs in the context of xenotransplantation."
9492091	"Patients with xeroderma pigmentosum variant show clinical photosensitivity, skin neoplasias induced by ultraviolet light, and defective postreplication repair, but normal nucleotide excision repair. We recently reported an alternative, simple method for the diagnosis of xeroderma pigmentosum variant that measures by autoradiography three cellular markers for DNA repair after ultraviolet irradiation: unscheduled DNA synthesis, recovery of RNA synthesis, and recovery of replicative DNA synthesis. Among hereditary photosensitive disorders, including other xeroderma pigmentosum groups, Cockayne syndrome, and a newly established ultraviolet-sensitive syndrome, only xeroderma pigmentosum variant cells exhibited normal unscheduled DNA synthesis, normal recovery of RNA synthesis, but reduced recovery of replicative DNA synthesis (51 +/- 6% the rate relative to normal controls). This reduction of recovery of replicative DNA synthesis was enhanced in the presence of a nontoxic level of caffeine to 36 +/- 5%. In this study we assess the cellular markers in two independent families that included two photosensitive patients that were identified as xeroderma pigmentosum variant. Cells from heterozygotic parents showed normal levels of unscheduled DNA synthesis, recovery of RNA synthesis, and recovery of replicative DNA synthesis, but reduced rates of recovery of replicative DNA synthesis in the presence of 1 mM caffeine (53 +/- 8% relative to the normal control). Furthermore, with a colony-forming assay, the cells showed normal survival by ultraviolet without caffeine, but slightly reduced survival by ultraviolet with 1 mM caffeine present. In one family, we confirmed inheritance of two heterozygous mis-sense mutations. One mutation is an A-->   G transition at nucleotide 1840 that generates a K535E mis-sense mutation. Another mutation is an A-->   C transversion at nucleotide 2003 that generates a K589 mis-sense mutation. Each of these mutations were absent in 52 unrelated Japanese individuals. These results suggest that xeroderma pigmentosum variant heterozygotes can be identified by their sensitivity to ultraviolet irradiation in the presence of nontoxic levels of caffeine."

Sera of 42 patients (37%) were positive for Ro/SSA antibodies. Clinical investigations, including Schirmer's test and enzymatic profiles, demonstrated that 60% (16 of 27) of scleroderma patients with sicca syndrome and 63% (10 of 16) with polymyositis (PM) were Ro/SSA positive. In these patients there was a significant association between Ro/SSA antibodies and rheumatoid factor. HLA-antigens DR2, DR3 and B8 showed an increased frequency in anti-Ro/SSA positive patients."
5417133	"The healing responses of three implant materials--fresh autogenous bone, allogenic decalcified freeze-dried bone, and alloplastic implant, beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP)--were evaluated and compared. Through-and-through furcational defects were surgically created in the third and fourth mandibular premolars of three dogs. Implant material was then placed individually in the surgical defects. All defects without grafting served as controls. Following grafting (ten weeks into the healing period), individual dogs were killed and prepared for light microscopy. The following results were recorded: (1) All materials were well-tolerated. No post-surgical complications occurred. (2) Graft sites showed more pronounced regeneration and the possibility of higher periodontal attachment than did control sites. (3) The defects filled with autogenous bone showed slightly more pronounced regeneration than in allogenic freeze-dried bone and beta-TCP."

Such important genes as keratin 6A and 6B, tubulin B6, desmocollin, and desmoglein 3 were among the top differentially expressed genes. In peripheral blood, pathways involved in hematopoetic cell lineage and immune response were found to be differentially expressed, including genes such as the Fc receptor-like A and 5, as well as immunoglobulin heavy chains. Using a principal components approach, we show that expression of genes in post-treatment skin more closely resembles that of healthy controls.<   BR />                                                                                        Treatment of psoriasis with adalimumab appears to be associated with modulation of keratinocyte and epidermal proliferation in the skin and with immunologic changes in the blood.

1294905	"In a retrospective analysis of 632 orthototopic liver transplant procedures performed between 1982 and 1997, the incidence of primary dysfunction (PDF) of the liver and its influence on organ survival were studied. Graft function during the first 3 postoperative days was categorized into four groups: (1) good (GOT max <    1000 U/l, spontaneous PT >    50%, bile production >    100 ml/day); (2) fair (GOT 1000-2500 U/l, clotting factor support <    2 days, bile <    100 ml/day); (3) poor (GOT >    2500 U/l, clotting factor support >    2 days, bile <    20 ml/day); (4) primary non-function (PNF; retransplantation required within 7 days). The aim of this study was to evaluate graft survival comparing organs with PDF (poor function) and PNF vs organs with initial good or fair function. After a median follow-up of 45 months, initially good and fair function of liver grafts resulted in a significantly better long-term graft survival compared with grafts with initially poor function or primary non-function (if re-transplanted) (P <    0.01). The Cox model revealed primary function as a highly significant factor in the prediction of long-term graft survival (P <    0.0001). We conclude that these results confirm the hypothesis that primary graft function is of major importance for the long-term survival of liver transplants. Patients with a poor primary function have the worst survival prognosis, which leads to the interpretation that these patients may be candidates for early retransplantation."
9822285	"Heparin-induced thrombocytopoenia (HIT) type II is an antibody-mediated, drug-induced thrombocytopenia which is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Several case reports and small series have described the occurrence of HIT type II in the haemodialysis population and the challenges associated with it. Some of these reports raise the possibility of a recent increase in prevalence of this condition. But to date, there has never been a large study to estimate the prevalence, demography or treatment options for this syndrome in the haemodialysis population.                                                                              The renal units in the UK were surveyed to establish the prevalence of HIT type II syndrome in the haemodialysis population. Demographic data for haemodialysis patients with HIT type II syndrome were gathered and current treatments assessed.                                                                              Fifty responses from the 81 UK renal units surveyed were received. The combined population for these units was 13 682 patients on dialysis of whom 10 564 were on maintenance haemodialysis. The prevalence and incidence of HIT type II syndrome in the UK haemodialysis population were 0.26 and 0.32 per 100 patients, respectively. The mean age of the patients with HIT type II syndrome was 62 years (range 22-86), 52% were females and 92% were Caucasians. Only 17% of patients have had complications of HIT syndrome. Thirty-six percent of renal units use danaparoid as anticoagulant of choice for patients on haemodialysis with HIT type II syndrome.                                                                                     This is the largest survey of HIT type II in the haemodialysis population to date. The prevalence is considerably lower (0.26 per 100 patients) than previous estimates, with only a minority of patients developing complications of the condition. Haemodialysis patients with HIT type II in the UK are predominantly treated with danaparoid."
5350775	"A calcipotriol/hydrocortisone combination ointment has been developed for treating psoriasis on sensitive skin areas such as the face. The efficacy and safety of two calcipotriol/hydrocortisone dose combinations were compared with two concentrations of calcipotriol in the same ointment vehicle in patients with psoriasis on the face and body. Patients were randomised to receive 8 weeks once daily treatment with calcipotriol 25 mcg/g or 50 mcg/g, either alone or combined with hydrocortisone 10 mg/g. On the body and face overall, no statistically significant differences in efficacy were observed between the calcipotriol/hydrocortisone formulations versus the calcipotriol alone formulations nor between the two concentrations of calcipotriol (50 mcg/g versus 25 mcg/g). On the face alone, calcipotriol/hydrocortisone was significantly more effective than calcipotriol alone (P <    0.001) but no consistent significant difference was found between the two concentrations of calcipotriol. There was a significant benefit of combining hydrocortisone with calcipotriol in the incidence of adverse drug reactions on the body and face (P = 0.006) and on the face (P <    0.001) but no significant difference was found between the two concentrations of calcipotriol either on the body and face or on the face. In facial psoriasis, combining hydrocortisone with calcipotriol resulted in an improved efficacy and tolerability compared to calcipotriol alone."

5190522	"In this article we describe a clinical entity appearing in seven preadolescent patients who presented with chronic red papules within a prominent nasal crease. Milia were also noted in the nasal crease, but there was no evidence of acne vulgaris. The duration of symptoms was 4 months to 2 years, and lesions ranged from inflamed red papules, which were treated with topical antiinflammatory medications, to scarred white papules requiring excision. Histologic evaluation of two lesions revealed keratin granulomas that were likely derived from ruptured, inflamed milia. Due to its similarity in appearance to acne vulgaris, but different pathogenesis and clinical course, we suggest naming this newly described entity ""pseudoacne of the nasal crease."""

We describe 3 patients who had unusual infiltrated and keratotic plaques affecting the lower legs or nasolabial area that persisted or recurred that may be related to this group of unusual keratoacanthomas. The 3 patients had differing clinical lesions that did not resemble classic keratoacanthomas, but were linked by their biopsy findings of hypertrophic lichen planus-like reaction and pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia with a prominent infundibulocystic component that progressed to multiple keratoacanthomas or infundibulocystic squamous cell carcinoma. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of biopsy material from 2 patients failed to detect human papillomavirus. All 3 presentations provided a therapeutic dilemma, but responded rapidly to acitretin treatment at a dosage of 10 to 25 mg daily, which was continued for 15 to 24 months.                                                                                      These cases illustrate an unusual reaction pattern that is hypertrophic lichen planus-like but, instead of evolving to classic lichen planus, progresses to infundibulocystic hyperplasia and the development of multiple keratoacanthomas or infundibulocystic squamous cell carcinomas. Retinoids represent a therapeutic option for this difficult clinical problem and may obviate repeated and extensive surgery."
4330437	"Common variants, such as those identified by genome-wide association scans, explain only a small proportion of trait variation. Growing evidence suggests that rare functional variants, which are usually missed by genome-wide association scans, play an important role in determining the phenotype. We used pooled multiplexed next-generation sequencing and a customized analysis workflow to detect mutations in five candidate genes for lignin biosynthesis in 768 pooled Populus nigra accessions. We identified a total of 36 non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms, one of which causes a premature stop codon. The most common variant was estimated to be present in 672 of the 1536 tested chromosomes, while the rarest was estimated to occur only once in 1536 chromosomes. Comparison with individual Sanger sequencing in a selected sub-sample confirmed that variants are identified with high sensitivity and specificity, and that the variant frequency was estimated accurately. This proposed method for identification of rare polymorphisms allows accurate detection of variation in many individuals, and is cost-effective compared to individual sequencing."
8455558	"Intraspecific variability in nitrogen use has not been comprehensively assessed in a natural poplar species. Here, a nitrogen isotope mass balance approach was used to assess variability in nitrogen uptake, assimilation and allocation traits in 25 genotypes from five climatically dispersed provenances of Populus balsamifera L. grown hydroponically with either nitrate or ammonium. Balsam poplar was able to grow well with either ammonium or nitrate as the sole nitrogen source. Variation within provenances exceeded significant provenance level variation. Interestingly, genotypes with rapid growth on nitrate achieved similar growth with ammonium. In most cases, the root:shoot ratio was greater in plants grown with ammonium. However, there were genotypes where root:shoot ratio was lower for some genotypes grown with ammonium compared to nitrate. Tissue nitrogen concentration was greater in the leaves and stems but not the roots for plants grown with ammonium compared to nitrate. There was extensive genotypic variation in organ-level nitrogen isotope composition. Root nitrogen isotope discrimination was greater under nitrate than ammonium, but leaf nitrogen isotope discrimination was not significantly different between plants on different sources. This can indicate variation in partitioning of nitrogen assimilation, efflux/influx (E/I) and root or leaf assimilation rates. The proportion of nitrogen assimilated in roots was lower under nitrate than ammonium. E/I was lower for nitrate than ammonium. With the exception of E/I, genotype-level variations in nitrogen-use traits for nitrate were correlated with the same traits when grown with ammonium. Using the nitrogen isotope mass balance model, a high degree of genotypic variation in nitrogen use traits was identified at both the provenance and, more extensively, the genotypic level."
2677376	"We cloned and analyzed nodABC from Rhizobium fredii USDA257. These genes are thought to have common functions in initiation of nitrogen-fixing nodules by all rhizobia. In USDA257, they were located in a 9.2-kb EcoRI fragment that was not closely linked to either of two copies of the regulatory gene, nodD. nodABC was present in a 3,094-base pair (bp) sequenced region, which also included a consensus nod-box promoter. The three open reading frames contained 654, 642, and 1,239 bp, respectively, and encoded deduced proteins of 21.9, 23.4, and 44.7 kD. The sequence of the nodABC region of USDA257 was generally homologous with corresponding regions from other rhizobia, but it diverged significantly in the 5' non-translated region and in the 3'terminus of nodC. nodC was not translationally coupled to nodSU, as in another soybean symbiont, Bradyrhizobium japonicum, and the deduced NodC protein was the shortest of any such proteins yet described. Site-directed mutagenesis of the 9.2-kb EcoRI fragment confirmed that nodA, nodB, and nodC are essential for nodulation of soybean, but failed to identify other linked nod genes. Daidzein, a major isoflavone from soybean roots, was the most potent of nine tested flavonoids in activating a plasmid-borne nodC::lacZ fusion. The 9.2-kb fragment complemented nodA-, nodB-, and nodC- mutants of R. meliloti to the Nod+ phenotype on Medicago sativa, M. truncatula, and Trigonella foenum-graecum. Nodule numbers, percentage of nodulated plants, and shoot dry weights, however, were considerably less than in plants inoculated with mutants complemented with nodABC from R. meliloti."

The thread width was recorded on both sides of each fixture image using a computer. Twenty-five randomized unclassified images were remeasured and the vertical angle of the x-ray beam was estimated from the previous measurements to test for validity of comparing images. The reliability of measurements with altered image magnification and penumbra were calculated. The reliability of 24 repeated thread width measurements was a SD of 0.01 mm. Of the 25 unknown beam angulations, 32 percent matched correctly, 20 percent +/- 1 degree, 16 percent +/- 2 degrees, or 68 percent <    or = +/- 2 degrees. Alteration from a short to a long cone technique was estimated to produce magnification errors similar to the reliability SD of 0.01 mm. Similarly the penumbra varied from 0.057 mm to 0.032 mm with short to long cones using a 1.0-mm focal spot. With a 0.6-mm focal spot, the smallest penumbra of 0.19 mm was twice the measurement reliability. This method demonstrated x-ray beam angulation and validity for comparing serial films can be estimated for the extreme variations but not accurately for +9 to -6 degrees from a tangent to the fixture.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
2299496	"Interferon-based regimens with first-generation protease inhibitors have a limited efficacy and an unfavorable safety profile. Combination therapies with two or more second-generation direct-acting antivirals plus/minus ribavirin revolutionized treatment strategies in patients chronically infected with hepatitis C virus. In this rapidly evolving era, patients in the transplant setting benefit from interferon-free treatment regimens. Scientific societies can barely keep up with this development, making it necessary to update the clinical guidelines by the American and European Associations for the Study of Liver Diseases within short periods. This review presents and discusses the currently available data of the use of interferon-free treatment in the setting of liver transplantation. However, costs, different reimbursement strategies, and health-care options cannot be answered by guidelines and recommendations from scientific societies. Further investigator-initiated trials are needed to individualize treatment concepts."
2030425	"Neonatal blood (NB) contains substantial numbers of stem and progenitor cells which decline rapidly after birth. Using a combination of cord blood (CB) and NB, we performed a successful, sibling transplant for a thalassaemia patient, leading to the proposal that NB could be used as an adjunct to CB for transplantation. This study was aimed at addressing the feasibility of expanding NB and thus minimizing the volume needed from a NB collection. In the presence of early acting cytokines interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-3, IL-6, stem cell factor (SCF), flt-3 ligand with and without thrombopoietin (Tpo), we compared the expansion capacity of CD34+ enriched cells from CB, NB and bone marrow (BM). Flow cytometry and colony-forming unit (CFU) analyses show that Tpo significantly increased the expansion of CD34+ cells from CB and NB to early and committed progenitors. No significant difference was observed between the expansion of CB and NB at 7, 14 or 21 days of culture in terms of CFU, CD34+ and CD61+ cell subsets. The expansion capacity of BM was significantly lower than that of NB or CB, possibly related to the low proportion of CD34+ CD38- cells observed at day 0. There was a relatively rapid expansion of NB which was evident at day 7 whilst the expansion of CB and BM remained low, suggesting a speedy maturation process in the postnatal infant. The expanded cells, being heterogeneous in their morphology and cell surface marker expression, were mostly of the myeloid lineage (CD45+, CD33+ and HLA-DR+). Our results showed that the expansion capacity of NB is comparable to that of CB and if transplanted, the expanded products of NB might contribute to the engraftment kinetics of the neutrophil and megakaryocyte lineage."
3951539	"Encephalopathy is a poorly characterized complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). No comprehensive report of encephalopathy exists for children, and the literature contains only a few for adults. We analyzed a large cohort of 405 pediatric patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT during a 10-year period and identified 26 patients (6.4%) who experienced encephalopathy. Identifiable causes of encephalopathy included infection (n=5), single or multiorgan failure (n=4), medication-related complications (n=3), nonconvulsive seizures (n=4), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (n=2), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (n=2), and stroke (n=1). We were unable to identify the etiology of encephalopathy in five (19%) patients. The prognosis for pediatric patients with encephalopathy was poor: only four (15%) experienced complete neurologic recovery, and 10 (38%) patients experienced partial recovery with residual neurologic deficits. Nine (35%) patients with complete or partial recovery survive long term. A total of 17 patients died; one died of progressive encephalopathy, and 16 died of either relapse of primary disease or toxicity. MRI, CSF analysis including molecular testing for infectious pathogens, and brain biopsy were helpful in obtaining a diagnosis in most of our patients. However, a standardized approach to accurate and timely diagnosis and treatment is needed to improve outcome in these patients."
5086020	"Acne in Apert syndrome and unilateral segmental acneiform nevus are associated with mutations of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2), which are likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of acne. Translational animal and cellular models, developmental biology studies and clinical observations have contributed to our understanding of FGF-FGFR2 signaling in the pilosebaceous follicle. The importance of FGF-FGFR2 signaling in mesenchymal-epithelial interaction for skin appendage formation, pilosebaceous follicle homeostasis, comedogenesis and sebaceous gland proliferation is explored. Overstimulation of FGFR2 signaling with increased expression of interleukin-1alpha explains acne in Apert syndrome und nevus comedonicus. Androgen-mediated up-regulation of FGFR2 signaling could be the initiating signal in the pathogenesis of acne. The gain of function FGFR2 mutations in Apert syndrome and unilateral acneiform nevus are most helpful model diseases for uncovering the fundamental process of androgen-dependent mesenchymal-epithelial FGF-FGFR2 signaling in acne in Apert syndrome, nevus comedonicus and acne vulgaris."
9593055	"There is anecdotal evidence of variation in the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma. We aimed to describe the decision-making process physicians use to define resectability and injectability in patients with metastatic melanoma, and to identify patient characteristics associated with unresectable and injectable lesions. Physicians in Germany, France and the UK who manage patients with metastatic melanoma completed a questionnaire and case report forms on lesion resectability and injectability. In total, 122 physicians participated in the study, collecting data on 1,193 patients. Physicians' resection history was the main factor impacting their resection decisions; those who had frequently performed resections in the past were more likely to consider a lesion resectable than those who had rarely performed resections. A physician's decision to resect varied according to field of expertise; 46% of oncologists rarely performed resections, but this was the case for only 10% of dermatologists and 26% of dermato-oncologists. Another important factor affecting resectability status was the number of in-transit lesions; 49% of patients with three or more in-transit lesions were considered resectable compared with 73% of patients with fewer than three in-transit lesions. Lesion location impacted on injectability status; cutaneous and regional lymph node lesions were often considered injectable, whereas distant lesions in the bone, brain, lung, and liver were considered uninjectable. Assessment of resectability status was influenced by physicians' resection history; this varied according to field of expertise, and may reflect the lack of clear guidance on resection for patients with advanced melanoma."
6895916	"Psychodermatology is a recognized subspecialty, but lack of awareness among dermatologists and limitation of resources make the management of these patients challenging. Clinicians are often unsure about the practicalities of setting up a psychodermatology service. There is confusion about which model is best suited to which service, and about the development of a psychodermatology multidisciplinary team.                                                                            To identify the necessary steps in setting up a psychodermatology clinic.                                                                              The study was based on the experience of a UK-based psychodermatology unit and the recently published standards by the UK Psychodermatology Working Party.                                                                              The type of service provision will depend on the type of patients seen in the unit. The core team will be composed of a psychodermatologist and a psychologist. Access to a psychiatrist is essential if patients present with primary psychiatric conditions or primary cutaneous conditions with suicidal or other psychiatric risks. Adequate training of the healthcare staff is advised. The premises and time allocation should be adequate, and this translates into higher tariffs. Using business care tariffs for people with mental health conditions might be more appropriate, as the consultations are longer and involve more members of staff; however, the overall cost remains lower than if these patients were seen in a general dermatology service or in the community.                                                                                      Psychodermatology services are globally limited, and yet the demand for psychodermatology care is high. There is evidence that dedicated psychodermatology services are cost-effective. Healthcare professionals need to be aware of the steps necessary to establish and maintain psychodermatology services."
6655589	"The nuclear factors presumably associated with the activation of the gene encoding phenylalanine ammonia-lyase by a fungal elicitor were characterized in pea (Pisum sativum L.) epicotyls. The TATA-proximal region was dissected and putative cis-regulatory elements in the promoter of pea phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene 1 were examined by gel-mobility shift and in vitro footprinting analyses. Specific binding of the nuclear factors to the promoter-proximal regions of pea phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene 1 associated with elicitor-mediated activation was detected at a region containing consensus sequence motifs of boxes 2 and 4 and other AT-rich sequences. The analyses of DNA fragments containing the deleted promoter regions suggested that a residue from -183 to -173 (ATTAGTAAGTGAT) was essential for a maximal activity of forming low-mobility complex (LMC) in the gel-mobility shift assay, and synthetic oligonucleotides confirmed the presence of at least one nuclear component associated with the formation of an active LMC. Competition experiments and treatment with Hoechst 33258 provided direct evidence that the formation of LMC with the promoter fragments from genes encoding phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and chalcone synthase in pea contained one or more of the same proteins that recognize AT-rich sequence motifs for binding. It also suggests that common high-mobility group-like proteins might be involved in the regulation of elicitor-inducible genes in pea."
7870390	"Intravenous vitamin C supplementation to haemodialysis patients might ameliorate responsiveness to recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEpo). This study was performed to analyse the relation between vitamin C plasma concentration and response to rHuEpo.                                                                              In a cross-sectional, single-centre observational study including all haemodialysis patients, pre-dialysis plasma vitamin C concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography and response to rHuEpo (haemoglobin concentration/international units rHuEpo/kg/week) was recorded together with baseline laboratory data.                                                                              Univariate analysis yielded a significant correlation between vitamin C plasma levels and response to rHuEpo (n = 130, r = 0.25, P = 0.004), which still persisted after adjustment for transferrin saturation, C-reactive protein, malondialdehyde, parathyroid hormone, route of rHuEpo administration, residual renal function and diabetes mellitus (adjusted r = 0.23, P = 0.014). Analysis per quartiles of vitamin C plasma level revealed a significantly lower response to rHuEpo with decreasing vitamin C values (P = 0.026).                                                                                      In unselected haemodialysis patients, vitamin C plasma levels account, at least partially, for the response to rHuEpo. Larger-sized interventional studies are needed to find out whether vitamin C plasma levels may or may not appropriately reflect the potential beneficial effect of vitamin C supplements on rHuEpo responsiveness."
5074088	"Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a slow growing, locally invasive tumour whose differentiation from other fibrohistiocytic tumours sometimes poses serious diagnostic problems. We investigated CD34 expression immunohistologically in various fibrohistiocytic tumours including dermatofibroma, DFSP, malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH), infantile myofibromatosis, fibrosarcoma, hypertrophic scar and keloid. Among these, DFSP was unique in that tumour cells themselves expressed CD34, whereas in other tumours. CD34 expression was observed only on vascular endothelial cells amongst the tumour cells. Until now, there have been no reports of useful immunohistological markers for DFSP. CD34 expression by the tumour cells can be an extremely useful marker in establishing a definitive diagnosis of DFSP."
9812237	"In immunoblot assays, at least three putative nuclear intermediate filament (NIF) proteins were detected in nuclear envelope-matrix (NEM) and lamin (L1) fractions of nuclei from plumules of dark-grown pea (Pisum sativum L.) seedlings. These NIF proteins had apparent molecular masses of ca. 65, 60, and 54 kDa (also referred to as p65, p60, and p54), and appeared as multiple isoelectric forms, with pIs ranging from ca. 4.8 to 6.0. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies were raised to the 65-kDa NIF protein bands excised from gels after electrophoresis. These anti-pea antibodies were specifically cross-reactive with the pea nuclear p65, p60, and p54 proteins and also with chicken lamins. Sequence alignment of peptide fragments obtained from the 65- and 60-kDa pea NIF proteins showed similarity with animal intermediate filament proteins such as lamins and keratins and with certain plant proteins predicted to have long coiled-coil domains. These pea NIF proteins were further purified and enriched from the NEM fraction using methods similar to those used for isolating animal lamins. When negatively stained and viewed by transmission electron microscopy, the filaments in the pea lamin (L1) fraction appeared to be 6-12 nm in diameter. As assayed by immunofluorescence cytochemistry using a confocal laser-scanning microscope, fixed pea plumule cells displayed uniform as opposed to peripheral nuclear staining by several of the antibody preparations, both polyclonal and monoclonal. This report describes the biochemical and immunological properties of these pea NIF proteins."
3997108	"The apoplast is suggested to be involved not only in the response, but also in the perception and transduction of various environmental signals. In this context, apoplastic alkalinization has previously been discussed as a general stress factor caused by abiotic and biotic stress events. In this study, an ion-sensitive fluorescence probe in combination with inverted fluorescence microscopy has been used for in planta monitoring of apoplastic shoot pH during challenging of Vicia faba L. plants by NaCl stress encountered at the roots. We demonstrate that transient increases in leaf apoplastic pH are dependent on the NaCl stress intensity. Moreover, we have visualized spatial pH gradients within the leaf apoplast. Our results indicate that these pH responses are propagated from root to leaf and that this occurs along the apoplast."
1795699	"Actinic granuloma is a rare skin disorder that develops in an area of actinic elastosis. The pathogenesis of the disease is obscure but the most accepted hypothesis implicates the solar radiation as the triggering factor. Typically the disease presents in middle-aged individuals with significant past sun-exposure and involves mainly the sun-exposed skin. It manifests as asymptomatic annular patches with elevated borders and central atrophy and shows little tendency to regression. Several treatments have been tried with variable success. We present a 74-year-old male who consulted our department for annular atrophic plaques involving his forehead and nose, present for 8 months and insidiously spreading but otherwise asymptomatic. A biopsy confirmed the clinical suspicion of actinic granuloma and excluded other possibilities. Our patient was commenced on acitretin 25 mg/day and showed a remarkable improvement within a year; the lesions stopped spreading and almost disappeared."
6893517	"Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants display a number of root developmental responses to low phosphate availability, including primary root growth inhibition, greater formation of lateral roots, and increased root hair elongation. To gain insight into the regulatory mechanisms by which phosphorus (P) availability alters postembryonic root development, we performed a mutant screen to identify genetic determinants involved in the response to P deprivation. Three low phosphate-resistant root lines (lpr1-1 to lpr1-3) were isolated because of their reduced lateral root formation in low P conditions. Genetic and molecular analyses revealed that all lpr1 mutants were allelic to BIG, which is required for normal auxin transport in Arabidopsis. Detailed characterization of lateral root primordia (LRP) development in wild-type and lpr1 mutants revealed that BIG is required for pericycle cell activation to form LRP in both high (1 mm) and low (1 microm) P conditions, but not for the low P-induced alterations in primary root growth, lateral root emergence, and root hair elongation. Exogenously supplied auxin restored normal lateral root formation in lpr1 mutants in the two P treatments. Treatment of wild-type Arabidopsis seedlings with brefeldin A, a fungal metabolite that blocks auxin transport, phenocopies the root developmental alterations observed in lpr1 mutants in both high and low P conditions, suggesting that BIG participates in vesicular targeting of auxin transporters. Taken together, our results show that auxin transport and BIG function have fundamental roles in pericycle cell activation to form LRP and promote root hair elongation. The mechanism that activates root system architectural alterations in response to P deprivation, however, seems to be independent of auxin transport and BIG."
9770978	"In planta secretion of fungal pathogen proteins, including effectors destined for the plant cell cytoplasm, is critical for disease progression. However, little is known about the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) secretion mechanisms used by these pathogens. To determine if normal ER function is crucial for fungal pathogenicity, Magnaporthe oryzae genes encoding proteins homologous to yeast Lhs1p and Kar2p, members of the heat shock protein 70 family in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, were cloned and characterized. Like their yeast counterparts, both LHS1 and KAR2 proteins localized in the ER and functioned in an unfolded protein response (UPR) similar to the yeast UPR. Mutants produced by disruption of LHS1 were viable but showed a defect in the translocation of proteins across the ER membrane and reduced activities of extracellular enzymes. The Deltalhs1 mutant was severely impaired not only in conidiation, but also in both penetration and biotrophic invasion in susceptible rice (Oryza sativa) plants. This mutant also had defects in the induction of the Pi-ta resistance gene-mediated hypersensitive response and in the accumulation of fluorescently-labeled secreted effector proteins in biotrophic interfacial complexes. Our results suggest that proper processing of secreted proteins, including effectors, by chaperones in the ER is requisite for successful disease development and for determining host-pathogen compatibility via the gene-for-gene interaction."
3922468	"Langerhans cells (LCs) have been cultured in a skin equivalent (SE). Seventy-two SEs were produced by inserting skin biopsies from nine subjects into dermal equivalents consisting of fibroblasts in a collagen matrix. The SEs were cultured in a serum-free medium containing 2-mercaptoethanol with or without 5 ng/mL granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). The SEs were cultured for 12 or 15 days. In the latter case, 0, 1 or 10 microg/mL cyclosporin A (CyA) was added for the last 3 days. The SEs were then snap frozen for immunohistochemistry. The migration of LCs was evaluated by measuring the distances from the inserted skin biopsy in the SEs to the HLA-DR + and CD1a+ dendritic cells localized at the longest distance from the biopsy in the epidermal outgrowth on both sides of the biopsy. The density of these cells was estimated in 15-day-old SEs by counting them on both sides of the inserted skin biopsy and dividing the number of positive cells by the migrated distances. All epidermal outgrowths (range 0.6-3.7 mm) were well differentiated and displayed HLA-DR+, CD1a+ and Lag+ dendritic cells. Only occasionally were CD83+ cells observed. In the 15-day-old SEs cultured with GM-CSF, a few CD86+ cells were seen in the epidermal outgrowths and occasionally CD80+ cells. The median (n = 4) density of CD1a+ and HLA-DR+ cells in the epidermal outgrowths at day 15 was 5.2 and 9.1 cells/mm, respectively. GM-CSF did not influence migration in 12-day-old SEs, but there was a tendency to increased migration of HLA-DR+ dendritic cells in 15-day-old SEs. CyA did not affect migration or density. We conclude that LCs can be cultured with an in vivo-like density in a SE. They express the phenotype of immature antigen-presenting cells efficient in capturing and processing antigen. This model may be suitable for studies of the initial phase of contact allergic reactions."
1573833	"Two distinct groups of proteoglycans, chondroitin 6-sulfate (C6-S) proteoglycan and heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG), have been recently shown to reside within the lamina densa of normal human skin basement membrane (BM). To determine whether either or both antigens are normally expressed in one or more forms of epidermolysis bullosa (EB), a disease known to have specific alterations in skin BM, we have examined by indirect immunofluorescence 31 specimens of clinically normal skin from 28 EB patients (simplex, 5; junctional, 8; dominant dystrophic [DDEB], 9; recessive dystrophic [RDEB], 9) with monoclonal antibodies to C6-S and HSPG. HSPG was normally expressed in all EB and control skin specimens, whereas C6-S was absent along the dermoepidermal junction of 9 of 9 RDEB and 7 of 9 DDEB, and reduced in 2 of 9 DDEB cases. In contrast, C6-S was normally expressed in 5 of 5 EB simplex, 5 of 6 junctional EB, and all control skin specimens. We have subsequently extracted a greater than 400 kD C6-S proteoglycan from normal skin BM and have found that the core protein may also contain heparan sulfate side chains. Our findings suggest that 3B3 monoclonal antibody recognizes a hybrid proteoglycan in human skin, and that its absent or reduced binding in dystrophic EB skin BM may reflect either absence of associated core protein or posttranslational alterations in the proteoglycan side chains."
4958583	"We examined the concentrations of metals (Cd, Zn, Cu, Fe and Mn) and potential metal-binding compounds [nicotianamine (NA), thiol compounds and citrate] in xylem and phloem saps from 4-week-old castor bean plants (Ricinus communis) treated with 0 (control), 0.1, 1.0, and 10 μM Cd for 3 weeks. Treatment with 0.1 and 1 μM Cd produced no visible damage, while 10 μM Cd retarded growth. Cadmium concentrations in both saps were higher than those in the culture solution at 0.1 μM, similar at 1.0 μM and lower at 10 μM. Cd at 10 μM reduced Cu and Fe concentrations in both saps. NA concentrations measured by capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (MS) in xylem sap (20 μM) were higher than the Cu concentrations, and those in phloem sap (150 μM) were higher than those of Zn, Fe and Cu combined. Reduced glutathione concentrations differed in xylem and phloem saps (1-2 and 30-150 μM, respectively), but oxidized glutathione concentrations were similar. Phloem sap phytochelatin 2 concentration increased from 0.8 μM in controls to 8 μM in 10 μM Cd. Free citrate was 2-4 μM in xylem sap and 70-100 μM in phloem sap. Total bound forms of Cd in phloem and xylem saps from 1 μM Cd-treated plants were 54 and 8%, respectively. Treatment of phloem sap with proteinaseK reduced high-molecular compounds while increasing fractions of low-molecular Cd-thiol complexes. Zinc-NA, Fe-NA and Cu-NA were identified in the phloem sap fraction of control plants by electrospray ionization time-of-flight MS, and the xylem sap contained Cu-NA."

Two double-blind, randomized, controlled, split-face studies (n = 42, Study 1; n = 35, Study 2) were conducted in women 30-70 years old with moderate to distinct periorbital wrinkles. Subjects applied 0.5 g of individual products to half their face twice daily for 4 weeks. Four test products containing niacinamide, the peptides Pal-KT and Pal-KTTKS, and carnosine were used and included a daytime SPF 30 lotion also containing antioxidants, a night cream, an eye cream also containing caffeine, and a wrinkle treatment containing retinyl propionate. The wrinkle treatment was only tested in Study 2. The FOITS technique was used to measure changes in periorbital R(a) (mean roughness) and R(z) (average maximum roughness) at 2 and 4 weeks.                                                                              In Study 1, the daytime SPF 30 lotion, night cream, and eye cream significantly improved crow's feet smoothness after 4 weeks relative to no treatment. After 4 weeks, the daytime SPF 30 lotion and night cream, but not the eye cream, were significantly better than no treatment at improving R(z). In Study 2, the night cream, eye cream, and wrinkle treatment, but not the daytime SPF 30 lotion, significantly improved both R(a) and R(z) after 4 weeks. To increase power and precision of estimates, a meta-analysis was performed; the pooled data showed all three products were significantly better than no treatment at improving R(a) and R(z) after 4 weeks.

The need for this test battery arises from increased awareness of the importance of prosody in clinical practice, and the development of methods for improving pitch perception in listeners with profound hearing losses.                                                                              Identification and discrimination tasks based on linguistic contexts were developed to establish listeners' just noticeable differences (JNDs) for pitch changes. Stimuli were pseudosentences and pseudowords based on speech from a female speaker, overlain with stylized pitch contours. Target pitch excursions were varied from the 200 Hz baseline to a maximum of 349 Hz. Ninety normal-hearing listeners participated in test validation that assessed goals (a)-(c), established test-retest reliability, and gathered normative data.                                                                              The JNDs on non-linguistic, control tasks were lower than on linguistic ones, showing that non-linguistic tasks may overestimate pitch perception in speech. Listeners from different language backgrounds scored comparably on most linguistic tasks, and test-retest differences were non-significant. Test usability as evidenced by task duration and subject experience seemed satisfactory for clinical use."
4261851	"Phytochemical investigation of the leaves of Pittosporum angustifolium resulted in the isolation and structural elucidation of nine new triterpene saponins, named pittangretosides A-I (1-9), together with a known compound (10). Mainly by NMR and HRESIMS experiments, eight compounds were identified as A1-barrigenol glycosides (1-7, 10), whereas two compounds exhibited an unusual 17,22-seco-backbone of oleanolic acid (8, 9). All compounds were evaluated for their in vitro cytotoxicities against human urinary bladder carcinoma cells (5637). Only compounds with an angeloyl-residue at C-22 of the aglycone (1-4 and 10) showed antiproliferative effects with IC50 values of 4.1, 5.2, 2.1, 17.9, and 2.4 µM, respectively."
1351558	"The high cost of cyclosporine A (CsA) is an impediment for low-income patients. Previous studies have used ketoconazole at doses between 200 and 400 mg/day to lower CsA consumption.                                                                              Ketoconazole and CsA were administered prospectively to renal transplant patients. Patients treated historically with CsA were used as a reference group. At different intervals posttransplant, clinical and laboratory data were recorded.                                                                              The reference group (n=14) was treated with CsA from 1992 to 1997 and the CsA plus ketoconazole group (n=17) from 1998 to 2002. Follow-up was 76+/-22 and 29+/-14 months, respectively. CsA doses throughout the study were 4.0+/-1.3 and 1.6+/-0.6 mg/kg/day (a 60% reduction, P =0.00). Trough levels of CsA were 194+/-87 and 193+/-69 ng/mL, respectively. The ketoconazole dose was 54+/-17 mg/day. The monthly cost of CsA was reduced by 60%, including the cost of ketoconazole.                                                                                      CsA with ketoconazole resulted in a substantial dose and cost reduction that proved safe and effective."
1847645	"Globally, governments have recognized the growing popularity of Complementary and Alternative Medicines and the possibility of their combined use with biomedicine. Decisions within the Government of India have led to a conducive environment for conducting clinical studies, to achieve integration of more than one system of medicine, so that their combined benefits can be brought to bear on chronic, difficult-to-treat conditions.                                                                            To develop integrative dermatology treatment protocols for patients with long-standing skin diseases who have received treatment from many centers.                                                                                            A team of doctors from modern dermatology, Ayurveda, yoga therapy, and homeopathy studied recruited patients to develop mutual orientation on each therapeutic system and a working knowledge of approach to their clinical diagnosis. Six-hundred thirty-eight patients affected by lower limb lymphedema requiring skin care as a major part of treatment were treated integrating modern dermatology and Ayurveda. Three-hundred eighty-one vitiligo patients were examined and treated to understand the clinical presentations and treatment options in Ayurveda.                                                                              A two-step cluster analysis performed by SPSS Version 16 showed average volume reductions of 13.3% and 23% on day 14, 19.7% and 31.1% on day 45, and 23.4% and 39.7% on day 90 of treatment in small and large lymphedematous limbs. Inflammatory episodes before the onset on this treatment was reported by 79.5% of our lymphedema patients, and 9.4% reported this at the end of three months after our treatment. Among vitiligo patients, we found that 39.6% of patients had kapha, 39.8% pitta, 10.8% had vatha and 0.52% has tridoshaja presentation. There are over 100 treatment options available in Ayurveda to treat vitiligo.                                                                                     Each system of medicine recognizes the same disease albeit with minor difference in description. Skin care procedures like washing and emollients restore the barrier function and skin health. We have converged Ayurvedic skin care with that of dermatology with an aim of achieving patient management that is better than that achievable by a single system alone. Overload of the lymphatic system due to loss of epidermal barrier function and consequent inflammation from bacteria and soil irritants is responsive to selected Ayurvedic herbal preparations.                                                                                     It is evident that integration at the therapeutic level is possible, although the pathological basis is interpreted differently. Irrespective of background understanding of the given disease, a mutually oriented multisystem therapeutic team was able to effectively use medicines from more than one system of medicine and to develop guidelines for their prescription and a patient care algorithm."
2355732	"The expression of translatable sequences of either one of the two Andean potato mottle virus (APMoV) coat protein (CP) genes (CP22 and CP42) and of the nontranslatable sequence of CP42 in transgenic tobacco provided protection against APMoV. Resistance was mediated by CP transgene RNAs rather than the protein, as an inverse correlation between resistance and the accumulation levels of CPs transgene mRNAs was observed. These data indicated that a post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) mechanism is likely involved in the APMoV CP RNA-mediated protection. Moreover, the HindIII-AccI restriction pattern of the CP22 transgene was different in susceptible and resistant transgenic plants, suggesting the involvement of methylation in PTGS. Southern blot experiments also revealed that CPs transgene insertion loci and organisation in the plant genome may play a role in determining the degree of protection."
9082186	"Dense Deposit Disease (DDD) is a devastating renal disease that leads to renal failure within 10 years of diagnosis in about half of affected patients. In this study, we evaluated the relative prevalence and pathological features of DDD diagnosed at our center over a 29 years period.                                                                              We reviewed the clinical and pathological features of all cases of DDD diagnosed at the Electron Microscopy Unit of Ain Shams University (ASUSH) between January 1983 and December 2011.                                                                              From a total of 3283 renal biopsies, 33 (1%) were diagnosed with DDD (10 children and 23 adults). Nephrotic syndrome was the predominant clinical presentation of DDD (51.5%), and was commoner in children than adults (80% vs. 43%, p=0.03). Capillary wall thickening was seen in all cases (100%). Crescents were more commonly seen in children than adults (70% vs. 21.7%, p=0.008) while interstitial fibrosis was more commonly seen in adults (78.3% vs. 40%, p=0.03). The commonest histological pattern seen under light microscopy was membranoproliferative (27.3%), followed by crescentic (21.2%), membranous (21.2%), diffuse proliferative (18.2%), lobular (6.1%) and mesangial proliferative (6.1%) patterns. Immunohistochemistry was available for 25 cases and showed intense linear staining for C3 along capillary walls. Electron microscopic examination revealed glomerular basement membrane (GBM) thickening and intra-membranous and tubular basement membrane deposits in all cases (100%).                                                                                     DDD is a rare disease in Egypt, found in only 1% of renal biopsies. Pathological features of the disease differ between adults and children; children have predominantly glomerular damage whereas tubuleinterstitial lesions are more often encountered in adults."
2940627	"Lymphoid cells with an affinity for the epidermis (epidermotropic lymphocytes) have been proposed to play a role in the immune functions of the epidermis. However, antigen-presenting Langerhans cells (LC) and indeterminate cells are presently the only cells in the human epidermis which have been demonstrated to originate in the bone marrow. Recent studies of murine epidermis have identified a population of bone marrow-derived cells which express Thy-1 antigen and which are present in a similar density to, but distinct from, LC. We therefore sought to identify the potential human analogue of the murine Thy-1+ epidermal cell utilizing a battery of antileukocyte reagents in immunohistochemical, flow cytometric, and cell sorting studies. A panel of antibodies failed to detect significant numbers of human Thy-1 antigen-bearing cells, T cells, B cells, monocytes/macrophages (other than LC), and natural killer cells in tissue sections, epidermal sheets, and epidermal cell (EC) suspensions. This was the case using EC suspensions either unfractionated or fractionated on Ficoll-Hypaque to enrich for leukocyte subpopulations. Since the nature of the murine Thy-1+ EC is uncertain, it is possible that antibodies directed against well-defined leukocyte subpopulations may not be of value in the detection of a potential human analogue. We therefore utilized double fluorescence staining with anti-HLe-1, an antibody which identifies all human leukocytes, and anti-HLA-Dr (Dr), which identifies epidermal LC, in order to demonstrate a potential population of HLe-1+ Dr- non-LC, bone marrow-derived cells. The vast majority of HLe-1+ cells were HLA-Dr+ LC; these were present at a density of 608 cells/mm2 in epidermal sheets. A minor population of HLe-1+ cells which did not express HLA-Dr (HLe-1+ Dr-) was observed in tissue sections, epidermal sheets, and EC suspensions. The nondendritic morphology and low density of these HLe-1+ Dr- EC in epidermal sheets (mean density of 4.2 +/- 1.6 cells/mm2) precluded their representing a strict human analogue of the murine Thy-1+ EC, since murine Thy-1+ EC are dendritic and are present in a density similar to that of LC. Purified preparations of the minor HLe-1+ Dr- EC population obtained by electronic cell sorting or panning and examined ultrastructurally were not enriched for any bone marrow-derived cell population. Thus, using currently available markers and sorting technology, we have been unable to identify a human analogue of the murine dendritic Thy-1+ epidermal cell."
1070375	"Two patients with the clinical and histopathologic findings of eosinophilic cellulitis are presented. In one patient there was a definite relationship between upper respiratory tract infection and flare-ups of eosinophilic cellulitis. This patient's condition was superimposed on a long history of chronic urticaria. In the other patient a relationship to recurrent sinusitis was possible but not definite. There were no other contributory underlying skin diseases in either patient. Eosinophilic cellulitis is not likely a disease entity as such but, instead, represents a severe urticarial hypersensitivity reaction to various stimuli. Collagen alteration by eosinophil granules results in flame figure formation and a granulomatous response, which may explain the prolonged persistence of the lesions."
8295216	"Lung function decline is a well-recognized occurrence after myeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) that has not been studied after nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens. We examined the lung function of patients before and after 2-Gy total body irradiation-based nonmyeloablative and myeloablative preparative regimens. Before HCT, at day 100, and 1 year after HCT, nonmyeloablative patients had lower 1-second forced expiratory volume (FEV1), forced vital capacity, total lung capacity, residual volume, and carbon monoxide diffusion capacity. However, after transplantation, the risk for experiencing a >   20% per year decrease of FEV 1 was significantly lower for nonmyeloablative than myeloablative patients >   50 years of age (odds ratio, 0.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.1-0.8; P = .01). Lower pretransplantation FEV 1 was associated with a higher mortality rate for both groups, with the highest mortality risk among patients with a pretransplantation FEV 1 <   60% (nonmyeloablative: hazard ratio, 3.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.9-8.0; myeloablative: hazard ratio, 7.2; 95% confidence interval, 2.5-21.2). These results suggest that despite having worse lung function, patients who receive the 2-Gy total body irradiation-based nonmyeloablative regimen will likely experience less pulmonary toxicity than patients who receive a myeloablative regimen, and this may have important clinical implications when deciding on a conditioning regimen for patients >   50 years of age with compromised pretransplantation lung function."
7336114	"Dehydroeffusol, a phenanthrene isolated from Juncus effusus L., possesses characteristic anxiolytic and sedative properties, as determined by an array of behavioral tests in mice. In the elevated plus-maze test, dehydroeffusol significantly increased the number of entries into the open arms and the time the mice spent in these arms in a dose-dependent manner, with a minimum effective dose of 2.5 mg/kg. Dehydroeffusol also significantly increased the head-dips of mice in the hole-board test in a dose-dependent manner, with a minimum effective dose of 5 mg/kg. Dehydroeffusol reduced mouse locomotion in the open-field test with a minimum effective dose of 5 mg/kg. In the rota-rod test, 1-5 mg/kg dehydroeffusol did not decrease the fall-down time of mice. The above results confirm that dehydroeffusol possesses anxiolytic and sedative properties and does not affect the general movement coordination of mice. This suggests that dehydroeffusol is a novel anxiolytic chemical derived from herbal medicines."
9605398	"Screening an Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) T-DNA mutant library for selenate resistance enabled us to isolate a selenate-resistant mutant line (sel1-11). Molecular and genetic characterization showed that the mutant contained a lesion in the SULTR1;2 gene that encodes a high affinity root sulfate transporter. We showed that SULTR1;2 is the only gene among 13 mutated genes of the Arabidopsis sulfate transporter family whose mutation conferred selenate resistance to Arabidopsis. The selenate resistance phenotype of the sel1-11 mutant was mirrored by an 8-fold increase of root growth in the presence of selenate as shown by the calculated lethal concentration values. The impairment of SULTR1;2 activity in sel1-11 resulted in a reduced (35)S-sulfate uptake capacity by both roots and calli and a reduced sulfate and selenate content in root, shoot, and calli. Comparing sulfate-to-selenate ratios instead of absolute sulfate and selenate contents in roots and shoots enabled us to gain better insight into the mechanism of selenate toxicity in Arabidopsis. Roots of the sel1-11 mutant line showed a higher sulfate to selenate ratio than that of wild-type roots, while there were no significant differences in sulfate to selenate ratios in shoots of wild-type and mutant lines. These results indicated that the mechanism that confers the selenate resistance phenotype to the sel1-11 line takes place rather in the roots. It might be in part the result of a lower selenate uptake and of a protective effect of sulfate against the toxic effects of selenate on root growth. These results revealed in plants a central and specific role of the transporter SULTR1;2 in selenate sensitivity; they further suggested that root growth and potentially the root tip activity might be a specific target of selenate toxicity in Arabidopsis."
8072658	"The antioxidant defense system involves complex functional coordination of multiple components in different organelles within the plant cell. Here, we have studied the Arabidopsis thaliana early response to the generation of superoxide anion in chloroplasts during active photosynthesis. We exposed plants to methyl viologen (MV), a superoxide anion propagator in the light, and performed biochemical and expression profiling experiments using Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChip microarrays under conditions in which photosynthesis and antioxidant enzymes were active. Data analysis identified superoxide-responsive genes that were compared with available microarray results. Examples include genes encoding proteins with unknown function, transcription factors and signal transduction components. A common GAAAAGTCAAAC motif containing the W-box consensus sequence of WRKY transcription factors, was found in the promoters of genes highly up-regulated by superoxide. Band shift assays showed that oxidative treatments enhanced the specific binding of leaf protein extracts to this motif. In addition, GUS reporter gene fused to WRKY30 promoter, which contains this binding motif, was induced by MV and H(2)O(2). Overall, our study suggests that genes involved in signalling pathways and with unknown functions are rapidly activated by superoxide anion generated in photosynthetically active chloroplasts, as part of the early antioxidant response of Arabidopsis leaves."
8561918	"A scanning electron microscope was used to compare the distal ends of exclamation mark hairs from alopecia areata patients with the fracture surface of normal hair fibres, mechanically broken by traction. The exclamation mark hairs shows minimal damage to the cuticular cell pattern of the hair shaft. Where the cuticle was absent, cortex and medulla showed low-density features fanning out into a fringe-like structure at the distal ends. The fracture surfaces of normal hair fibres, mechanically broken by traction showed a markedly abnormal cuticular scale pattern, whereas the features of cortical and medullary tissue were normal. These morphological differences between the fracture surface of exclamation mark hairs and normal hair fibres, mechanically broken by traction, may enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis of alopecia areata."

The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the clinical outcome (ie, osseointegration) of hydroxyapatite coated, bioactive glass coated and machined titanium alloy threaded dental implants in human jaw bone after implantation.                                                                                            One hundred twenty-six implants (45 hydroxyapatite coated, 41 bioactive glass coated, and 40 machined titanium implants) have been placed in incisor areas of 62 adult patients. Outcome was assessed up to 12 months after prosthetic rehabilitation using different clinical and radiological parameters. Surface roughness of failed implants was analyzed by laser profilometer.                                                                                     Hydroxyapatite and bioactive glass coating materials were nontoxic and biocompatible. Least marginal bone loss in radiograph, significantly higher (P <    0.05) interface radiodensity, and less interfacial gaps were observed in computed tomography with bioactive glass coated implants at anterior maxilla compared to other 2 types.                                                                                     Bioactive glass coated implants are equally safe and effective as hydroxyapatite coated and machined titanium implants in achieving osseointegration; therefore, can be effectively used as an alternative coating material for dental implants."
7776767	"Few studies have investigated the long-term effects of a maintenance regimen in the prevention of relapses in scalp seborrheic dermatitis (SD), in particular following biomarker changes.                                                                                            A new shampoo containing beta-glycyrrhetinic acid (18βGA) in addition to cyclopiroxolamine (CPO) and zinc pyrithione (ZP) was tested in 67 subjects suffering from SD with moderate to severe erythema and itching in a biphasic study. After a first common intensive treatment phase (investigational product thrice a week × 2 weeks), subjects randomly received the investigational product once a week × 8 weeks (maintenance) or a neutral shampoo (discontinuation) in a comparative, parallel group maintenance phase. Efficacy was assessed clinically (overall clinical dandruff score, erythema, overall efficacy, self-evaluation), biochemically and microbiologically by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) analysis of scale samples (Malassezia species (restricta and globosa), cohesion proteins (plakoglobins), inflammation (Interleukin (IL)-8, IL-1RA/IL-1α) and pruritus (histamine, cathepsin S) markers).                                                                              During the intensive treatment phase, SD improved significantly (p <    0.0001) with a decrease in clinical signs as well as Malassezia species, cohesion proteins, inflammation and pruritus markers. During the maintenance phase, the improvement persisted in the 'maintenance' group only, with a significant intergroup difference. A consistently positive relationship was found between dandruff, itching, erythema and Malassezia populations, histamine levels and IL-1RA/IL-1α ratio.                                                                                     The effectiveness of this maintenance regimen was objectively demonstrated at the clinical, biochemical and microbiological level. Correlations between clinical signs and biomarkers could provide clues to explain the resolution of SD and confirm the interest of biomarkers for SD treatment assessment."
2455798	"Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is an autosomal-recessive genetic disorder defined by hypomelanosis in the eyes, hair, and skin. Piebaldism is an autosomal-dominant congenital leukoderma associated with a white forelock. The molecular pathogeneses of these congenital pigmentary disorders have been clarified in recent years and are briefly reviewed here.                                                                                   The pathologic gene mutations causing OCA and piebaldism are as follows. When a mutated tyrosinase gene produces inactive, less active, or temperature-sensitive tyrosinase, its phenotype is tyrosinase-negative (type I-A), yellow-mutant (type I-B), or temperature-sensitive (type I-TS) OCA, respectively. Mutation of the P gene encoding the tyrosine-transporting membrane protein probably occurs in tyrosinase-positive OCA (type II). A heterozygous mutation of the c-kit gene encoding mast cell-stem cell growth factor receptor induces piebaldism.                                                                                     The molecular bases of several types of OCA and piebaldism have been elucidated by gene technology, and other gene mutations causing OCA or many other pigmentary disorders will be clarified in the near future."

9085212	"Folates undergo oxidative cleavage in vivo, releasing a pterin aldehyde fragment that can be re-used in folate synthesis if the aldehyde group is reduced. High levels of NADPH-dependent reductase activity against pterin-6-aldehyde and its dihydro form were detected in Arabidopsis, pea and other plants; modeling predicted that the activity would maintain in vivo pterin aldehyde pools at extremely low levels (<   0.2 pmol g(-1) FW). Subcellular fractionation showed that the pea leaf activity is mainly cytosolic, and anion exchange chromatography revealed multiple isoforms, all of which catalyzed reduction of other aldehydes. Arabidopsis seed activity likewise comprised various isoforms. An Arabidopsis gene (At1g10310) encoding a pterin aldehyde reductase was identified by searching the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family for proteins predicted to be NADPH-linked, and sharing conserved residues with reductases that mediate analogous reactions. The recombinant protein behaved as a dimer in size exclusion chromatography. In addition to pterin aldehydes, it catalyzed the reduction of diverse aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes: Vmax values varied <   5-fold, but Km values ranged from 3.6 microm to 1.7 mm, those for pterin-6-aldehyde and dihydropterin-6-aldehyde being 36 and 56 microm, respectively. Activity with dihydropterin-6-aldehyde was unusually high at 0 degrees C. The At1g10310 transcript was most abundant in seeds, but, as expected for multiple isoforms, inactivating the At1g10310 gene caused only a minor change in seed pterin aldehyde reductase activity. We conclude that pterin aldehyde salvage in plants involves multiple, generalist NADPH-linked reductases, and that the At1g10310 enzyme is typical of these and hence suitable for use in engineering studies of folate turnover."

6400114	"We recently demonstrated that frequencies of T cell receptor-V (TcR-V)-specific subsets are frequently altered after both allogeneic and autologous BMT. The data reported here describe several characteristics of altered T cell subsets: (i) their capacity to endure peripherally, (ii) their correspondence to clonal donor T cell subsets, (iii) the origin of the clone (in one case amenable to analysis) from a mature T cell and not from new lymphopoiesis, and (iv) the presence of such a clone throughout a year of follow-up in a patient with chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in whom it represented up to 1/10th of CD3+ peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and was found to be host-reactive. Taken together, these findings provide direct evidence for the oligoclonality of a large proportion of the peripheral T cell repertoire in patients subsequent to bone marrow transplantation, possibly accounting for their frequent depressed immune status. Moreover, the anti-host reactivity demonstrated in a clone from the patient with chronic GVHD strongly suggests that an oligoclonal response can be linked to a pathological process."

PAL enzymes are encoded by a gene family in plants. Here, we report a genome-wide search for PAL genes in watermelon. A total of 12 PAL genes, designated ClPAL1-12, are identified . Nine are arranged in tandem in two duplication blocks located on chromosomes 4 and 7, and the other three ClPAL genes are distributed as single copies on chromosomes 2, 3, and 8. Both the cDNA and protein sequences of ClPALs share an overall high identity with each other. A phylogenetic analysis places 11 of the ClPALs into a separate cucurbit subclade, whereas ClPAL2, which belongs to neither monocots nor dicots, may serve as an ancestral PAL in plants. In the cucurbit subclade, seven ClPALs form homologous pairs with their counterparts from cucumber. Expression profiling reveals that 11 of the ClPAL genes are expressed and show preferential expression in the stems and male and female flowers. Six of the 12 ClPALs are moderately or strongly expressed in the fruits, particularly in the pulp, suggesting the potential roles of PAL in the development of fruit color and flavor. A promoter motif analysis of the ClPAL genes implies redundant but distinctive cis-regulatory structures for stress responsiveness. Finally, duplication events during the evolution and expansion of the ClPAL gene family are discussed, and the relationships between the ClPAL genes and their cucumber orthologs are estimated."
1730811	"The number of clinical trials in solid organ transplantation is progressively increasing year on year, but the quality of design and reporting still varies considerably. The constraints on organ availability, improving short-term outcomes, ethics and timescales involved in organ transplantation present unique challenges for trials in this field. An understanding of the methodology and potential pitfalls in clinical research is essential both to interpret trial results and to design robust studies. This review summarizes the scope and quality of reporting in existing transplant clinical trials and details aspects of clinical trial methodology with particular relevance to transplantation. We highlight initiatives designed to improve the quality of this process to ensure that the results of clinical trials are robust, well reported and of use in everyday clinical practice."
9903025	"Pregnant women may have skin conditions that require topical corticosteroids. However, little is known about their safety in pregnancy.                                                                                  We sought to evaluate the available evidence concerning the safety of topical corticosteroids in pregnancy.                                                                              We systematically searched 17 databases and trial registers, and contacted pharmaceutical companies. Randomized controlled trials and cohort studies of topical corticosteroids in pregnant women, and case-control studies comparing maternal exposure to topical corticosteroids between patients and control subjects were included. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used for quality assessment of included studies.                                                                              Seven studies, including two cohort and five case-control studies, were included. Most studies did not find significant associations of topical corticosteroids with congenital abnormality, preterm delivery stillbirth, and mode of delivery. One study found a significant association between first-trimester use of topical corticosteroids and orofacial cleft, and another study found a significant association between very potent topical corticosteroids and low birthweight.                                                                                      The available data were limited and mainly on orofacial cleft. The quality of evidence was generally low.                                                                                      Currently limited and inconclusive data are unable to detect an association between topical corticosteroids and congenital abnormality, preterm delivery, or stillbirth. The current evidence shows no statistically significant difference between pregnant women who use and those who do not use topical corticosteroids. However, there does appear to be an association of very potent topical corticosteroids with low birthweight. Further cohort studies with comprehensive outcome measures, consideration of corticosteroid potency, dosage and indications, and a large sample size are needed."

Array-based studies can help identify therapeutic targets.                                                                                  To reproducibly assess single-gene transcriptional changes in psoriatic skin.                                                                              We evaluated 210 top candidate genes from a first psoriasis study group (population 1), and then confirmed differential expression in a second independent psoriasis study group (population 2).                                                                              One hundred and thirty-eight differentially expressed genes were replicated in the 2 studies, of which 57 have not previously been reported as associated with psoriasis. This is significantly greater than the 10 expected false positives. Lesional skin vs uninvolved areas showed inflammatory and cell regulation changes.                                                                                     Previously undescribed psoriasis-associated genes revealed in this study may provide potential future targets for development and assessment of novel therapeutic agents for psoriasis."
5448532	"An analysis of NMDP data shows that allele-level matching for HLA A, B, C, and DRB1 is preferred in the selection of adult unrelated donors. If mismatching is unavoidable, mismatches at HLA B or C may be better tolerated than those at A or DRB1. Whether mismatches are at the allele level (ie, within an antigen group) or at the antigen level makes no difference in outcome, except at HLA C where allele mismatches are better tolerated. Matching for HLA DQ and DP should be prioritized below matching at the 4 major loci. These findings are compared and contrasted with previous publications. The impact of HLA matching on major outcomes in umbilical cord blood (UCB) transplantation continues to be refined. Total nucleated cell dose was previously thought to be sole determinant of outcome with partially HLA matched UCB transplantation, but HLA matching, particularly at low total nucleated cell dose, appears to play an important role. Relatively small sample sizes limit the consistency of findings from cord blood studies, but the consensus supports consideration of both total nucleated cell dose and HLA matching in the selection of optimal UCB units. As search considerations for both adult donors and umbilical cord blood units have become more complex, the National Marrow Donor Program has developed software, services and relationships to ease the burden on transplant teams."
8471627	"The relationship between computerized tomography (CT) values of bone surrounding endosseous implants and the cutting torque values required for self-tapping during implant placement was examined for the purpose of predicting the initial stability (bone quality) during implant placement by presurgical CT scan examinations and determining whether it can be quantified.                                                                                            The study sample consisted of 13 subjects with 56 implants. Sites for implant placement were determined based on CT data using implant planning software. The average CT values of the bone surrounding the simulated implants were calculated by the software. Using a stereolithographic drill guide, implants were placed at the locations indicated by the protocol. The cutting torque values required for self-tapping were measured during implant placement. The resulting CT values and cutting torque values were analyzed statistically for correlation.                                                                              The correlation was considered significant at a level of .01 or less, and the correlation coefficient was 0.77.                                                                                     There was a strong correlation between CT values and cutting torque values in the clinical cases evaluated. These results indicate that it may be possible to predict and quantify initial implant stability and bone quality from presurgical CT diagnosis and implant simulation.

3121900	"Patients with atopic dermatitis frequently show elevated blood eosinophil counts, and eosinophil-derived major basic protein has been demonstrated in the eczematous skin from patients with atopic dermatitis. To evaluate further the role of eosinophils in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis, the concentration of eosinophil cationic protein was measured in serum samples of 42 patients with moderate to severe disease. The results were compared with those obtained in 32 patients with psoriasis with (n = 9) or without (n = 23) a history of inhalant allergy, 12 patients with a history of pseudoallergic reactions to acetylsalicylic acid, 14 patients with a history of inhalant allergy, and 31 nonatopic healthy control subjects. Eosinophil cationic protein levels were significantly increased in the serum of patients with atopic dermatitis (p less than or equal to 0.005) and patients with a history of pseudoallergic reactions to acetylsalicylic acid (p less than or equal to 0.01). There was no significant difference between eosinophil cationic protein levels in patients with psoriasis or a history of inhalant allergy and in control subjects. Moreover, eosinophil cationic protein levels did not differ significantly in psoriasis patients with or without inhalant allergy. These studies support the concept of an active participation of eosinophils in atopic dermatitis and point to a possible role for eosinophils in pseudoallergy."
2642820	"Microsatellites or SSRs (simple sequence repeats) are ubiquitous short tandem duplications occurring in eukaryotic organisms. These sequences are among the best marker technologies applied in plant genetics and breeding. The abundant genomic, BAC, and EST sequences available in databases allow the survey regarding presence and location of SSR loci. Additional information concerning primer sequences is also the target of plant geneticists and breeders. In this paper, we describe a utility that integrates SSR searches, frequency of occurrence of motifs and arrangements, primer design, and PCR simulation against other databases. This simulation allows the performance of global alignments and identity and homology searches between different amplified sequences, that is, amplicons. In order to validate the tool functions, SSR discovery searches were performed in a database containing 28 469 nonredundant rice cDNA sequences."
1940494	"To evaluate whether further improvement in porcine islet xenotransplantation is feasible, a number of questions were addressed. Earlier we showed significant improvement in the nude mouse of the porcine islets by selection through long-term culture. Now these islets were tested in the stringent pig-to-rat model. Islets were isolated from adult pigs, cultured for 1.5-3 weeks and transplanted to rats. Possible rejection mechanisms were assessed by interference of the cellular response with cyclosporine A (CsA), blocking macrophages with gadolinium chloride (GdCl), and suppressing the humoral response with cyclophosphamide. Modifications in graft size and condition were analyzed. Untreated control recipients showed primary nonfunction (PNF). CsA treatment could fully overcome PNF and resulted in graft survival from 10 to over 134 days. Rejection was the main cause of function loss. Although rejection could not be prevented by intensifying the induction therapy, increased maintenance immunosuppression effectively blocked rejection, albeit at the expense of toxicity. Blocking the humoral response was ineffective; all grafts showed PNF. In contrast, depletion of macrophages fully prevented PNF. Combination of GdCl and CsA gave no additional effect, and grafts were rejected between 57 and 162 days. Generally, graft survivals were similar to those reported in the literature; however, long-term cultured islets required much less maintenance immunosuppression. Cessation of graft function was not always due to rejection; in some cases ""islet exhaustion"" was found, possibly caused by discrepancy between the graft size and the rapidly growing recipient. Neither the presence of damaged islet tissue in the graft nor the size of the graft exerted any influence on graft survival. On rejection, no real infiltration of the graft was seen; destruction gradually processed from the outside. The good functional capability of the cultured islets was illustrated by disappearance of the clinical symptoms and increase in body weight, which almost doubled in the long-term survivors."
1032988	"Human piebaldism is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by congenital depigmented patches of skin and hair. Piebaldism results from mutations of the kit proto-oncogene, which encodes a cell-surface receptor, tyrosine kinase, whose ligand is the stem/mast cell growth factor. We report four unrelated patients with piebaldism and consider the variations in phenotype in relation to the site of the kit gene mutation."
5324779	"Ganciclovir, also called DHPG, was administered intravenously to eight renal transplant recipients with life-threatening cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonitis. One patient died of pulmonary failure; a favorable clinical response was observed in the seven others. In one patient, CMV pneumonitis recurred but responded well to a second course of the drug. At no time was the immunosuppressive regimen completely stopped in the seven surviving patients. Six of them maintained a good renal function 1-11 months after treatment with ganciclovir. No toxic effect was detected during therapy. We conclude that ganciclovir appears to be a promising and effective treatment for CMV pneumonitis after renal transplantation."
3139783	"As part of an ongoing investigation into the organization and regulation of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway, two Arabidopsis thaliana expressed sequence tag (EST) clones (153O10T7 and YAY780) with high homology to leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase (LDOX) or flavonol synthase (FLS) were identified. EST YAY780 was sequenced and found to encode a protein 49 to 78% identical to all LDOX sequences in the database. EST 153O10T7 was used to isolate a genomic clone encoding a protein with 59 to 61% sequence identity to petunia (Petunia hybrida) and potato (Solanum tuberosum) FLS. DNA blot analysis was used to screen the Arabidopsis genome for sequences related to FLS and LDOX and to determine the positions of the two clones on the RI map. The expression patterns of FLS and LDOX in etiolated seedlings moved to white light and in two putative regulatory mutants (ttg and tt8) were determined by RNA blot analysis. These studies indicate that FLS is an ""early"" flavonoid gene in Arabidopsis seedlings, whereas LDOX is a ""late"" gene. Furthermore, FLS is the first flavonoid enzyme identified in Arabidopsis that may be encoded by a gene family."

2710327	"In receptor-coupled signaling, the phenomenon called transactivation develops when one or more receptors activate yet another. This process has been demonstrated most exhaustively in relation to G-protein coupled receptors (GPRCs) (1) when, upon appropriate stimuli, engagement of given GPRCs may cause the transactivation of other receptor signaling systems. Importantly, certain cytokines, chemokines and agonists of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) may also exert similar effects (2). This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
8685326	"G2A is a stress-inducible G protein-coupled receptor for oxidized free fatty acids, such as 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE). As skin is routinely and pathologically exposed to many oxidative stresses such as UV radiation, chemical agents, and inflammation that might induce both G2A expression and production of G2A ligands, we examined G2A function in human keratinocytes. G2A was expressed in human epidermis, normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK), and an immortalized human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT). 9(S)-HODE evoked intracellular calcium mobilization and secretion of cytokines, including IL-6, IL-8, and GM-CSF in NHEK cells. These responses became prominent in HaCaT cells by overexpression of G2A. 9(S)-HODE inhibited proliferation of NHEK cells by suppressing DNA synthesis and arresting the cell cycle in the G0/1-phase. On the other hand, 13(S)-HODE, another major oxidative product from linoleate, showed little or no effect on either cytokine secretion or on proliferation in NHEK cells. A small interfering RNA designed to downregulate G2A caused suppression of 9(S)-HODE-induced inhibitory effects on proliferation of NHEK cells. UVB and H(2)O(2) induced G2A expression and caused oxidation of linoleate to produce 9-HODE in HaCaT cells. These results suggest that 9-HODE-G2A signaling plays proinflammatory roles in skin under oxidative conditions."
8394493	"Recent publications suggest that tyrosinase mRNA in blood as well as in bone marrow is detectable only in a subgroup of patients with metastatic melanoma.                                                                                  We addressed the question, whether patients with metastatic melanoma and with RT-PCR-detectable tyrosinase mRNA in blood or bone marrow have a different prognosis compared to tyrosinase mRNA-negative patients.                                                                              20 melanoma patients with widespread clinical metastases were enrolled and the survival time after first diagnosis of visceral metastases was correlated to tyrosinase mRNA presence in blood and bone marrow samples.                                                                              The time of survival of 8 patients with metastatic melanoma and detectable tyrosinase mRNA in either blood or bone marrow was not different from the prognosis of 12 patients without detectable tyrosinase mRNA in either blood or bone marrow.                                                                                     Although based on a limited number of patients our results suggest that detection of tyrosinase mRNA in blood or bone marrow samples of melanoma patients with advanced disease seems to have no substantial relevance for survival time and outcome of disease. For this purpose, detection of tyrosinase mRNA by RT-PCR is not a valid tumor marker. Nevertheless, tyrosinase positivity in bone marrow in earlier tumor stages might indicate increased risk for the development of distant metastases. This should be addressed in further studies."

The patient had a psychiatric history and a 32-year history of variable unstable psoriasis. Reported suicide in patients with psoriasis receiving adalimumab is rare (only one other reported case). It is important, however, to recognize the effects of skin disease on the mental health of vulnerable patients receiving biological agents. Patients will benefit from a more holistic approach that includes both dermatological and psychological assessment and treatment."
3329940	"Knowledge about the structural elements of skin and its appendices is an essential prerequisite for understanding their complex functions and interactions. The hence necessary morphological description across several orders of scale not only requires the investigation at the light microscopic level but also ultrastructural investigation, ideally on the identical sample. For a correlative and multimodal observation one unique preparation protocol is mandatory. As a compromise between sample sizes of >   500 microm in diameter on the one hand and optimal preservation of antigenicity and morphology on the other, we developed a new preparation protocol that allows (i) 3D reconstruction of the resin-embedded sample by confocal light microscopy prior to (ii) direct immunolocalization of target proteins within selected sample planes by light and fluorescence microscopy or transmission electron microscopy. Alternatively, (iii) serial cryosections of the frozen sample can be taken for characterizing the sample in toto. With this unique approach we were able to fully demonstrate the structural complexity of axillary skin samples, increasing the structural resolution from 3D reconstruction of the whole gland up to ultrastructural investigations at the subcellular level. We could demonstrate that axillary sweat glands are not separately distributed, as has been assumed to date; instead, they seem to be intricately twisted into one another. This promotes the concept of a complex axillary sweat gland organ instead of single sweat gland entities."
5453596	"Protein synthesis is a highly energy demanding process and is regulated according to cellular energy levels. Light and sugar availability affect mRNA translation in plant cells but the specific roles of these factors remain unclear. In this study, sucrose was applied to Arabidopsis seedlings kept in the light or in the dark, in order to distinguish sucrose and light effects on transcription and translation. These were studied using microarray analysis of steady-state mRNA and mRNA bound to translating ribosomes.                                                                              Steady-state mRNA levels were affected differently by sucrose in the light and in the dark but general translation increased to a similar extent in both conditions. For a majority of the transcripts changes of the transcript levels were followed by changes in polysomal mRNA levels. However, for 243 mRNAs, a change in polysomal occupancy (defined as polysomal levels related to steady-state levels of the mRNA) was observed after sucrose treatment in the light, but not in the dark condition. Many of these mRNAs are annotated as encoding ribosomal proteins, supporting specific translational regulation of this group of transcripts. Unexpectedly, the numbers of ribosomes bound to each mRNA decreased for mRNAs with increased polysomal occupancy.                                                                                      Our results suggest that sucrose regulate translation of these 243 mRNAs specifically in the light, through a novel regulatory mechanism. Our data shows that increased polysomal occupancy is not necessarily leading to more ribosomes per transcript, suggesting a mechanism of translational induction not solely dependent on increased translation initiation rates."
3342413	"Despite possessing multiple sets of related (homoeologous) chromosomes, hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum) restricts pairing to just true homologs at meiosis. Deletion of a single major locus, Pairing homoeologous1 (Ph1), allows pairing of homoeologs. How can the same chromosomes be processed as homologs instead of being treated as nonhomologs? Ph1 was recently defined to a cluster of defective cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)-like genes showing some similarity to mammalian Cdk2. We reasoned that the cluster might suppress Cdk2-type activity and therefore affect replication and histone H1 phosphorylation. Our study does indeed reveal such effects, suggesting that Cdk2-type phosphorylation has a major role in determining chromosome specificity during meiosis."
2880362	"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectivity of multidetector computed tomography angiography (MDCT-A) to detect active bleeding in transplant patients.                                                                                            Between 1999 and 2006, 532 patients underwent renal or liver transplantation. MDCT-A was performed on recipients who displayed decreased hemoglobin levels or who had a hematoma during abdominal ultrasound imaging. The MDCT-A used a 16-detector CT device (Siemens, Sensation) with slices 0.75 mm thick after injection of nonionic contrast media (4 mL per second). A multiple intensity projection (MIP) technique was used to maintain angiographic images in the axial and coronal planes.                                                                              MDCT-A detected active bleeding among 23 posttransplant patients: 10 of arterial origin and 13 venous, as proven either by angiography or during operation. Among 8 of the 11 patients who underwent angiographic imaging the arterial origin was embolized. For three patients the angiographic evaluation was not helpful to find the bleeding point. A cohort of 5 of 12 patients did not undergo angiographic evaluation and were followed by clinical and ultrasonographic findings. Seven patients underwent re-operating.                                                                                     Management of the patients who were suspected to have active bleeding after renal or liver transplantation was benefitted by MDCT-A as an accurate and feasible screening modality."
6667559	"Mast cells (MC) are important cellular components of the immune network in diverse organs. The skin MC has likewise been implicated in IgE- and complement-mediated cutaneous reactions. Such reactions supposedly involve specific cell surface membrane receptors. In this study, the cell surface marker profile of human skin MC was established using monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) against defined CD antigens. MC were isolated from juvenile foreskin (n = 55) and adult mammary skin (n = 5). The reactivity of MC with MoAb was assessed by a combined toluidine blue/immunofluorescence staining technique. Confirming our previous analyses on lung MC, foreskin MC reacted with MoAb against CD9, CD29, CD33, CD43, CD44, CD45, CD46, CD51, CD54, CD55, CD58, CD59, CD61, and CD117 (c-kit). Foreskin MC were also recognized by MoAb to CD47, CD48, CD49d, CD53, CD60, CD63, CD81, CD82, CD84, CD87, CD92, CD97, CD98, and CD99. Recently clustered CD antigens detectable on foreskin MC were CD147 (neurothelin), CD149 (MEM133), CD151 (PETA-3), and CD157 (BST-1). In contrast to lung MC and MC from adult skin, foreskin MC were found to express CD88 (C5aR). Also, cutaneous MC (from both juvenile foreskin and adult mammary skin), but not lung MC, were found to bind the CD32 MoAb IV.3, 2E1, and FLI8.26 (Fc gammaRII). The CD50 antigen (ICAM-3) was detectable on lung MC, but not on foreskin MC or MC of adult mammary skin. In summary, our data show that cutaneous MC and lung MC express an almost identical phenotype; however, in contrast to lung MC, cutaneous MC appear to express substantial amounts of CD32 and to lack CD50. In addition, foreskin MC, unlike MC from adult skin or lung, express CD88."
8830857	"The large water requirements of Vitis vinifera L. together with an increase in temperature and drought events imply the need for irrigation in the driest areas of its distribution range. Generous watering may reduce grape quality so irrigation should be precisely regulated through the development of new methods of accurate irrigation scheduling based on plant 'stress sensing'. Two new methods, the reflectivity in the S-band and the broadband ultrasonic spectroscopy, can be used as non-invasive and reproducible techniques for the study of plant water relations in V. vinifera. On one hand, the measurement of reflectance at frequencies around 2.4 GHz gives an excellent accuracy when the changes in the existing area (S) between two reflectance curves are correlated with the relative water content (RWC). On the other hand, an improvement of the broadband ultrasonic spectroscopy based on the enlargement of the analysis frequency window provides, apart from the determination of the turgor loss point (TLP), additional information about the leaves without additional computational cost or additional leaf information requirements. Before TLP, the frequency associated with the maximum transmittance (f/f(o)), the macroscopic elastic constant of the leaf in the Z direction (c(33)) and, specially, the variation of the attenuation coefficient with the frequency (n), were highly correlated with changes in RWC. Once turgor is lost, a shift in the parameters directly related to the attenuation of the signal was also observed. The use of both techniques allows for a more convincing knowledge of the water status in V. vinifera."
2669952	"Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) outcomes in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) remain poorly defined. We performed a meta-analysis of allo-SCT studies in HL patients. The primary endpoints were 6-month, 1-year, 2-year and 3-year relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). A total of 42 reports (1850 patients) was included. The pooled estimates (95% confidence interval) for 6-month, 1-year, 2-year and 3-year RFS were 77 (59-91)%, 50 (42-57)%, 37 (31-43)% and 31 (25-37)%, respectively. The corresponding numbers for OS were 83 (75-91)%, 68 (62-74)%, 58 (52-64)% and 50 (41-58)%, respectively. There was statistical heterogeneity among studies in all outcomes. In meta-regression, accrual initiation year in 2000 or later was associated with higher 6-month (P=0.012) and 1-year OS (P=0.046), and pre-SCT remission with higher 2-year OS (P=0.047) and 1-year RFS (P=0.016). In conclusion, outcomes of allo-SCT in HL have improved over time, with 5-10% lower non-relapse mortality and relapse rates, and 15-20% higher RFS and OS in studies that initiated accrual in 2000 or later compared with earlier studies. However, there is no apparent survival plateau, demonstrating the need to improve on current allo-SCT strategies in relapsed/refractory HL."
2521561	"Glucocorticoids (GCs) are highly detrimental to skin integrity and function both when applied topically for anti-inflammatory treatments and during conditions of circulating excess, e.g., Cushing's syndrome. Within target tissues, GC availability is regulated at a prereceptor level, independently of systemic levels, by isozymes of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD) that interconvert active cortisol and inactive cortisone. Many of the adverse effects of GCs on skin are also reminiscent of the natural aging process. 11β-HSD1 (which activates cortisol), but not 11β-HSD2 (which inactivates cortisol), was expressed in epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts in human skin and also in outer hair follicle root sheath cells in murine skin. 11β-HSD1 activity was present ex vivo in both species and increased with age in human skin tissue explants. In primary human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) from both photoprotected and photoexposed sites, 11β-HSD1 also increased with donor age. Additionally, photoexposed HDF displayed higher 11β-HSD1 mRNA expression than donor-matched photoprotected HDF. GC treatment of HDF caused upregulation of 11β-HSD1 mRNA levels independent of donor age or site. The age- and site-associated increase in dermal 11β-HSD1, and the ensuing increased local GC activation, may contribute to the adverse changes in skin morphology and function associated with chronological aging and photoaging."
5147563	"A novel approach for the study of early bone formation around dental implants in the miniature pig was evaluated. In addition to the traditional histologic and histomorphometric analysis, the expression of the osteogenic genes was analyzed both at the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein level.                                                                                            Mandibular premolars and the first molar were extracted in six miniature pigs. After 3 months of healing, 36 specially designed bone chamber implants were placed. Three different implant surface configurations were used: titanium SLA, titanium SLActive, and titanium zirconium SLActive (Roxolid). Each hemi-mandible received three randomly allocated implants (one for each surface type) on both sides of the arch, in a split-mouth design. Three animals were sacrificed after 3 days and another three after 2 weeks of healing post-implant insertion. For each animal the right hemi-mandible underwent qualitative histologic and quantitative histomorphometric analysis. The left hemi-mandible underwent immunohistofluorescence (IHF) analysis. β-catenin, Runx2, osteopontin, and osteocalcin were analyzed by IHF; osterix, and osteocalcin mRNA expression was also evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).                                                                              At 3 days after the implantation, all implants were surrounded by blood clot. No provisional matrix or bone was observed inside the chamber. Infection or degenerative lesions were absent. At 2 weeks, the histomorphometric analysis showed no significant difference between the groups concerning the bone area. qRT-PCR showed that Ti SLActive had the highest osteocalcin mRNA expression followed by Ti SLA and Roxolid SLActive. Osterix mRNA expression was higher on Ti SLA and Roxolid SLActive compared to Ti SLActive. The differences were not statistically significant. IHF was only found positive for osteocalcin at 2 weeks. At 3 days, osteocalcin was detected only on native bone. At 2 weeks, osteocalcin was expressed highest by Ti SLActive followed by Roxolid SLActive and TiSLA; however, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups in the osteocalcin expression level.                                                                                     The present methodology allowed evaluation of changes in gene expression during the early phase of osteogenesis that seem to be related to the quality of the surface. Further studies with higher power and more specific antibodies are needed to confirm these preliminary findings."

The aim of this study was to assess the cause and clinicopathologic findings of injection-induced dermatitis, and to reveal whether the reaction has any relation to the patient's age, injection site, drug concentration, and time interval from the injection to the occurrence of the skin lesion.                                                                              In this study, we enrolled 10 patients who developed erythematous skin lesions after the injection of causative drugs. The lesions were compared to each other according to the injection site, time interval from the injection to the occurrence of the skin lesion, and clinical characteristics. We performed intradermal and patch tests in each patient with different concentrations of causative drugs.                                                                              The most common causative drugs were diclofenac and vitamin K1. The eczematous type was the most frequent clinical type. The intradermal test showed more positive results than the patch test. The patch tests with diclofenac (as is, 2.5%, 5%, and 10%) and vitamin K1 (10%) were all negative in 10 patients. Furthermore, intradermal tests with diclofenac (as is) and vitamin K1 (0.1%, 1%, and 10%) were performed in 8 patients. Six patients had a positive reaction, consisting of erythema, induration, and vesiculation, after 1 and 2 days.                                                                                     Our results showed that the most common causative agents were diclofenac and vitamin K1. Moreover, it seems that that intradermal test is more useful than the patch test in the diagnosis of injection-induced dermatitis."
8115290	"The ability of the nitrogen-fixing bacterial endophyte Acetobacter diazotrophicus strain PAl5 to enhance the growth of sugarcane SP70-1143 was evaluated in the growth chamber, greenhouse, and field by comparing plants inoculated with wild-type and Nif mutant MAd3A in two independent experiments. The wild-type and Nif mutant strains colonized sugarcane plants equally and persisted in mature plants. In N-deficient conditions, sugarcane plants inoculated with A. diazotrophicus PAl5 generally grew better and had a higher total N content 60 days after planting than did plants inoculated with mutant MAd3A or uninoculated plants. These results indicate that the transfer of fixed N from A. diazotrophicus to sugarcane might be a significant mechanism for plant growth promotion in this association. When N was not limiting, growth enhancement was observed in plants inoculated with either wild-type or Nif- mutants, suggesting the additional effect of a plant growth promoting factor provided by A. diazotrophicus. A 15N2 incorporation experiment demonstrated that A. diazotrophicus wild-type strains actively fixed N2 inside sugarcane plants, whereas the Nif- mutants did not."
2331304	"Sterols become functional only after removal of the two methyl groups at C4 by a membrane-bound multienzyme complex including a 3beta-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase/C4-decarboxylase (3betaHSD/D). We recently identified Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) 3betaHSD/D as a bifunctional short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase protein. We made use of three-dimensional homology modeling to identify key amino acids involved in 4alpha-carboxy-sterol and NAD binding and catalysis. Key amino acids were subjected to site-directed mutagenesis, and the mutated enzymes were expressed and assayed both in vivo and in vitro in an erg26 yeast strain defective in 3betaHSD/D. We show that tyrosine-159 and lysine-163, which are oriented near the 3beta-hydroxyl group of the substrate in the model, are essential for the 3betaHSD/D activity, consistent with their involvement in the initial dehydrogenation step of the reaction. The essential arginine-326 residue is predicted to form a salt bridge with the 4alpha-carboxyl group of the substrate, suggesting its involvement both in substrate binding and in the decarboxylation step. The essential aspartic acid-39 residue is in close contact with the hydroxyl groups of the adenosine-ribose ring of NAD+, in good agreement with the strong preference of 3betaHSD/D for NAD+. Data obtained with serine-133 mutants suggest close proximity between the serine-133 residue and the C4beta domain of the bound sterol. Based on these data, we propose a tentative mechanism for 3betaHSD/D activity. This study provides, to our knowledge, the first data on the three-dimensional molecular interactions of an enzyme of the postoxidosqualene cyclase sterol biosynthesis pathway with its substrate. The implications of our findings for studying the roles of C4-alkylated sterol precursors in plant development are discussed."
3606359	"Eccrine syringofibroadenoma (ESFA) is a rare disorder. We report the first case of ESFA of the nail apparatus, which presented as a yellow longitudinal onycholytic band of the left fourth finger over an intermittently painful subungual filamentous tumour. Histological examination showed features of ESFA with a digitate pattern of papillomatosis due to the specialized physiological longitudinal arrangement of the ridges in the nail bed. In addition, we describe a new feature of colloidal iron-positive clear cells. In our case, the presence of two types of cells with a central ductal differentiation and a significant amount of mucopolysaccharides in clear cells could suggest differentiation towards both the ductal and the secretory portion of the eccrine gland."
6916585	"We describe a case of a 16-year-old African-American boy with bullous pemphigoid (BP), an acquired autoimmune blistering disease that is rarely seen in children. The patient's lesions, however, were distinctly herpetiform, complicating initial diagnosis and therapy. A diagnosis of BP was made by direct and indirect immunofluorescence. Immunoblotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis confirmed the presence of autoantibodies directed against the BP180 antigen. The autoantibodies reacted with the same epitopes within the immunodominant BP180 NC16A domain that have previously been shown to be the target of autoantibodies in BP. This case describes an uncommon disease in the pediatric population and should be included in the differential diagnosis in young patients with an unusual generalized vesicular eruption."
4519643	"Hair follicle differentiation involves the expression of both epithelial-type keratins or cytokeratins and hair keratins as well as hair keratin-associated proteins. In this study, a cDNA clone encoding a cytokeratin family member was isolated using RNA differential display techniques. The predicted amino acid sequence derived from this clone, revealed a homology with a number of cytokeratins, not only in the central alpha-helical regions but also in the conserved portions of the amino and carboxy terminal domains, indicating that this protein represents a new member of the mouse type II cytokeratin family. Northern blot analysis showed expression in mouse skin, but not in other tissues, including tongue, esophagus, and forestomach. One- and two-dimensional western blot analysis showed that this new cytokeratin was 57 kDa in size and ran slightly below the area of cytokeratin 5, which corresponded to that of the cytokeratin 6 family members. Both RNA in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical studies of mouse anagen hair follicles demonstrated expression of this cytokeratin in the inner root sheath hair cone during anagen III and in the Henle and Huxley layers of the inner root sheath during anagen VI. The expression of the new cytokeratin began in the hair bulb and progressed up to the height of the keratogenous zone. Taken together the sum of the data analyzed, we have termed this novel cytokeratin mK6irs (mouse gene nomenclature k2-6g) to indicate both its similar mobility with K6 in two-dimensional gels and its specific expression in the inner root sheath of the hair follicle."
7047701	"When two surgical defects are closely approximated, primary closure may be difficult because of tension on the tissue between the defects. We outline a technique using a Burow's-triangle advancement flap in which the advanced Burow's triangle contains the second defect. The defects are easily closed with a single flap that utilized the second defect. This flap is useful when there are two closely approximated surgical defects of which primary closure is limited by tension on the tissue between the defects."
4230162	"A previously validated 15-item questionnaire on dogs' life quality (QoL1) and that of their owners (QoL2) was applied in a multicentre study to owners of 200 dogs with different dermatological conditions, together with a question on the owner-perceived disease severity (S). Factor analysis was applied to the whole questionnaire. The correlation of S with QoL1 and QoL2 scores was evaluated using Spearman's rank correlation tests. Owner sex, age, educational level and willingness to pay for a potential definitive cure of the disease were recorded, and compared with quality of life (QoL) scores. In 23 atopic dogs, CADESI-03, pruritus Visual Analogue Scale and QoL scores were obtained before and after therapy, and their correlation was evaluated with linear regression. Factor analysis revealed that three factors (S, QoL1 and QoL2) explained 75% of the variance. Owner-perceived severity correlated significantly with QoL1 and QoL2 (P = 0.002 and P = 0.015, respectively). The five diseases with the worst QoL scores were scabies, pododermatitis, complicated atopic dermatitis, pemphigus foliaceus and endocrine alopecia. Pruritic diseases did not give significantly higher QoL1 or QoL2 scores compared with nonpruritic diseases (P = 0.19, Kruskall-Wallis test). Owner sex, age or educational level did not influence QoL scores. Female sex, a younger age and a higher educational level were significantly associated with more willingness to pay. In atopic dogs, all the scores decreased after therapy, but post-treatment CADESI-03 and Visual Analogue Scale scores did not correlate with QoL1 and QoL2. Questions related to the burden of maintenance therapy showed the lowest improvements in score."

Preventive measures are stressed and therapy is outlined for each entity; the rationale for many of the interventions is discussed. It is not the intent of this paper to cover each subject comprehensively."
2385663	"To evaluate the role of filaggrin in keratin filament aggregation in epidermolytic ichthyosis (epidermolytic hyperkeratosis, EH), we studied EH skin by light and electron microscopic immunohistochemistry, and biochemical analysis using sodium dodecylsulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Immunohistochemical staining showed an increased number of filaggrin-immunoreactive cell layers, but the reaction was still confined to the mid- and upper epidermal layers, whereas an abnormal granular pattern of staining for K10 began in the lower suprabasal cell layers. This suggests that the aggregation of keratin filaments precedes, and occurs independently of, profilaggrin synthesis during epidermal differentiation. Although keratohyalin granules were frequently associated with clumped filaments, immunoelectron microscopy showed that K10 labelling was confined to keratin filaments (including clumped filaments), and that antifilaggrin antibodies stained only keratohyalin granules, at least in the living cells. Certain keratin aggregates in the cornified cells were still devoid of filaggrin staining. However, in some cells which appeared partially cornified, filaggrin immunoreactivity occurred over the aggregated keratin filaments. Immunoblotting showed a clear increase of filaggrin/profilaggrin expression, without evidence for a qualitative abnormality. It seems unlikely, therefore, that filaggrin is primarily involved in the keratin filament clumping in EH, but that in some EH cases it interacts with keratins in a defective manner, possibly due to premature cell death and profilaggrin processing and/or altered keratin filament structure involving the interaction points of keratin with filaggrin."
1830668	"Immunologic abnormalities seem to play an important role in important role in systemic sclerosis (SSc).                                                                              We studied the following immune parameters to get more insight into SSc: autoantibodies (antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-Scl-70, anticentromere antibodies (ACA) subsets of lymphocyte subpopulations and markers of their activation, as well as serum levels of IL-2, the soluble IL-2 receptor (SIL-2R), IL-6 and its correlation to N-terminal procollagen-III propeptide (P III P), and finally, the IL-6 production by SSc and normal dermal fibroblasts.                                                                              In patients with active SSc, we found a reduced number of CD2+ T-lymphocytes and an increase in the expression of T-lymphocyte activation markers such as CD25+ and CD71+, HLA-DR Ia, as well as elevated serum levels of SIL-2LR and IL-6. SSc fibroblasts did not produce more IL-6 than normal fibroblasts in monolayer cultures.                                                                                      Our data show that a wide range of immunologic parameters are altered in SSc. In general, T-helper (TH) lymphocytes are activated possibly because of reduced T-suppressor (TS) and natural killer (NK)-cell levels. TH may polyclonally stimulate B cells, which in turn produce higher amounts of autoantibodies. Our findings support the concept that TH cell-derived cytokines/growth factors stimulate matrix protein synthesis by fibroblasts, resulting in generalized fibrosis."
3923145	"Loss-of-function mutations of the IL36RN gene, encoding interleukin-36 receptor antagonist (IL-36Ra), have been reported as major pathogenic causes of generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP), especially in cases lacking previous histories of psoriasis vulgaris. Palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP), which is traditionally included among GPP-related diseases, has a controversial association with IL36RN. While a negative view about the said association has been recently published from Europe, variations of the IL36RN gene show great ethnic differences. In this study, we performed mutation analysis of the IL36RN gene in 88 Japanese patients with PPP and identified three types of single base substitutions in four patients, namely, p.Pro82Leu in two patients, p.Asn47Ser in one and p.Thr123Met in another. All variations were heterozygous and different from previous European reports. We compared the immunohistochemical findings of IL-36Ra on patients with and without variation of the IL36RN gene; however, no significant differences were observed. Our data and the previous European study suggest that PPP is not associated with mutations of the IL36RN gene."
2843308	"Early plants began colonizing the terrestrial earth approximately 450 million years ago. Their success on land has been partially attributed to the evolution of specialized metabolic systems from core metabolic pathways, the former yielding structurally and functionally diverse chemicals to cope with a myriad of biotic and abiotic ecological pressures. Over the past two decades, functional genomics, primarily focused on flowering plants, has begun cataloging the biosynthetic players underpinning assorted classes of plant specialized metabolites. However, the molecular mechanisms enriching specialized metabolic pathways during land plant evolution remain largely unexplored. Selaginella is an extant lycopodiophyte genus representative of an ancient lineage of tracheophytes. Notably, the lycopodiophytes diverged from euphyllophytes over 400 million years ago. The recent completion of the whole-genome sequence of an extant lycopodiophyte, S. moellendorffii, provides new genomic and biochemical resources for studying metabolic evolution in vascular plants. 400 million years of independent evolution of lycopodiophytes and euphyllophytes resulted in numerous metabolic traits confined to each lineage. Surprisingly, a cadre of specialized metabolites, generally accepted to be restricted to seed plants, have been identified in Selaginella. Initial work suggested that Selaginella lacks obvious catalytic homologs known to be involved in the biosynthesis of well-studied specialized metabolites in seed plants. Therefore, these initial functional analyses suggest that the same chemical phenotypes arose independently more commonly than anticipated from our conventional understanding of the evolution of metabolism. Notably, the emergence of analogous and homologous catalytic machineries through convergent and parallel evolution, respectively, seems to have occurred repeatedly in different plant lineages."
2088598	"Verticillium wilt (VW) is a fungal disease that causes severe yield losses in alfalfa. The most effective method to control the disease is through the development and use of resistant varieties. The identification of marker loci linked to VW resistance can facilitate breeding for disease-resistant alfalfa. In the present investigation, we applied an integrated framework of genome-wide association with genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) to identify VW resistance loci in a panel of elite alfalfa breeding lines. Phenotyping was performed by manual inoculation of the pathogen to healthy seedlings, and scoring for disease resistance was carried out according to the standard test of the North America Alfalfa Improvement Conference (NAAIC). Marker-trait association by linkage disequilibrium identified 10 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers significantly associated with VW resistance. Alignment of the SNP marker sequences to the M. truncatula genome revealed multiple quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Three, two, one and five markers were located on chromosomes 5, 6, 7 and 8, respectively. Resistance loci found on chromosomes 7 and 8 in the present study co-localized with the QTLs reported previously. A pairwise alignment (blastn) using the flanking sequences of the resistance loci against the M. truncatula genome identified potential candidate genes with putative disease resistance function. With further investigation, these markers may be implemented into breeding programmes using marker-assisted selection, ultimately leading to improved VW resistance in alfalfa."
9639610	"The coding region for the Escherichia coli groEL (chaperonin-60) polypeptide was fused downstream of a pea rubisco small subunit transit peptide coding sequence under the control of a tandem 35S CaMV promoter. Transgenic tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi) containing this modified groEL gene were produced. The modified groEL polypeptide was correctly imported into chloroplasts and accumulated to high or low levels in different plants. The majority of the modified groEL polypeptide was processed correctly to the mature form within the chloroplasts. Approximately 20% of the imported polypeptides retained a portion of the N-terminal transit peptide (TPgroEL). Both groEL and TPgroEL polypeptides assembled into tetradecameric species in the chloroplasts. In plants accumulating high levels of these products, the majority of the plant chaperonin-60 polypeptides in the chloroplast were present in novel hybrid tetradecameric species containing both bacterial and plant chaperonin-60 polypeptides. In plants accumulating low levels of groEL, the predominant species present appeared to be authentic plant cpn60(14) and authentic bacterial groEL14. The growth and development of transgenic and control tobacco plants were indistinguishable."

7423403	"The S-receptor kinase (SRK) gene which is implicated in the self-incompatibility system of Brassica oleracea is one member of a large and complex family of similar sequences. Genomic and cDNA clones were isolated for the authentic, S-linked SRK29 gene and its DNA sequence determined. Reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) was used to detect the expression of SRK29 and other members of the family in stigma, leaf and root tissues. The SRK was found to be stigma-specific whereas, for instance, K3 transcripts appeared in all three tissues. The RT-PCR analysis also demonstrated the existence of partially processed intermediates for several of the kinase transcripts and, in the case of SRK29, a product apparently resulting from the splicing of a cryptic intron. RFLP analysis of an F2 family segregating for the S29 allele was used to show S-linkage for the SRK and possibly for the K2 sequence. The K8 kinase probe also revealed a minor RFLP which segregated with the S-locus."
7026654	"Organ survival in the short-term period post-transplant has improved dramatically over the past few decades. Whether this has translated to a long-term survival benefit remains unclear. This study quantifies the progression of nonrenal solid organ transplant outcomes from 1989 to 2009 in liver, lung, heart, intestine and pancreas transplants. Long-term graft survival was analyzed using data on adult solid organ transplant recipients from the UNOS/SRTR database and is reported as organ half-life and yearly attrition rates. Liver, lung, heart, intestine and pancreas half-lives have improved from 5.8 to 8.5, 1.7 to 5.2, 8.8 to 11, 2.1 to 3.6 and 10.5 to 16.7 years, respectively. Long-term attrition rates have not shown the same consistent improvement, with the yearly attrition rate 5-10 years post-transplant for liver, lung, heart and pancreas changing from 4.7 to 4.3, 10.9 to 10.1, 6.4 to 5.1 and 3.3 to 4.2, respectively. Attrition rates for intestine and pancreas transplantation alone display more variability due to smaller sample size but exhibit similar trends of improved first-year attrition and relatively stagnant long-term attrition rates. With first-year survival and attrition rates almost at a pinnacle, further progress in long-term survival will come from targeting endpoints beyond first-year rejection and survival rates."

It strongly supports the concept of lesion induction, while raising the question of an additive or even synergistic effect of these types of therapy."
2394528	"Psoriasis may have a severe impact on patients' quality of life (QOL) in several ways, an impact mediated by the mental or physical difficulties they have to deal with during the course of the disease and the various treatment regimens. In addition, psoriatic patients often suffer from experiences of stigmatization (EOS) related to the disease.                                                                                   This study was designed to test the hypotheses that psoriasis patients report higher levels of stigmatization than a comparison group, and that their EOS play a role in mediating the impact of the severity of psoriasis on their QOL.                                                                              One hundred patients with psoriasis (study group) and 100 patients with mixed skin problems (comparison group) were matched according to age, sex and education. All subjects answered questionnaires on EOS and QOL. A dermatologist diagnosed the diseases and measured severity scores. The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score was used for psoriasis and a linear severity score for the comparison patients. The mediating effect of EOS was analysed using structural equation modelling (SEM). SEM is a multivariate statistical method used to examine the consistency of a theory relating one group of variables (termed a 'latent construct') to another: in the present study, the relationship between EOS and QOL.                                                                              Psoriatic patients were found to report significantly higher levels of EOS related to the disease, compared with the comparison group. No significant differences were found regarding QOL or severity of disease. Clinical severity of psoriasis was found to correlate negatively with QOL in psoriasis patients. EOS were found to have a complete mediating effect for the severity of disease on the QOL in patients with psoriasis. This result was not found among the comparison group patients.                                                                                      The results of this study indicate that psoriasis patients experience higher levels of stigmatization than do other dermatological patients, and that these EOS mediate the association between disease severity and patients' reported low levels of QOL. Treatment of psoriatic patients should consider these results and should include tools for psychosocial intervention."
2132653	"Because results from single-center (mostly kidney) donor studies demonstrate interpersonal relationship and financial strains for some donors, we conducted a liver donor study involving nine centers within the Adult-to-Adult Living Donor Liver Transplantation Cohort Study 2 (A2ALL-2) consortium. Among other initiatives, A2ALL-2 examined the nature of these outcomes following donation. Using validated measures, donors were prospectively surveyed before donation and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 mo after donation. Repeated-measures regression models were used to examine social relationship and financial outcomes over time and to identify relevant predictors. Of 297 eligible donors, 271 (91%) consented and were interviewed at least once. Relationship changes were positive overall across postdonation time points, with nearly one-third reporting improved donor family and spousal or partner relationships and >   50% reporting improved recipient relationships. The majority of donors, however, reported cumulative out-of-pocket medical and nonmedical expenses, which were judged burdensome by 44% of donors. Lower income predicted burdensome donation costs. Those who anticipated financial concerns and who held nonprofessional positions before donation were more likely to experience adverse financial outcomes. These data support the need for initiatives to reduce financial burden."
6890890	"Liver transplantation has become a widely accepted form of therapy for many life-threatening liver illnesses. Since the introduction of CsA in 1980, numerous centers have opened and now more than 800 liver transplants are performed in the United States per year. In most large series, a 70% 5-year survival rate is seen. However, in terms of survival, hepatic transplantation for carcinoma continues to lag behind other diseases. In the absence of an available alternative treatment for this group of patients, vigorous investigation into prevention of recurrences following OLT is needed. Despite the proliferation of liver transplant programs, optimization of postoperative care remains a major challenge for those physicians who care for these patients. Too often, the diagnosis of rejection in contrast to infection is guided by clinical suspicion rather than firm evidence. Reversal of multiorgan dysfunction is often aggravated by the very immunosuppressants which allow transplantation. Maximizing graft acceptance and organ function while minimizing infectious complications remains the ultimate goal for transplant surgeons and is the key to further success."
7788960	"13-Cis-retinoic acid has an influence on bone in patients on long-term treatment as well as on short-term treatment. The presence of skeletal abnormalities after the treatment was established by roentgenologic and scintigraphic examinations. We wanted to know whether a 6-month course of low-dose 13-cis-retinoic acid has a clinically important influence on bone density in men with severe acne.                                                                              We examined 15 men with severe acne before and after treatment with 13-cis-retinoic acid by dual-photon absorptiometry of the lumbar spine.                                                                              The mean increase in bone density was 3.0% (95% confidence interval 1.3-4.5), which is normal for the period from puberty to late twenties. Bone density increased in 13 of our 15 patients.                                                                                      As shown by this highly sensitive modern densitometric method, 13-cis-retinoic acid has no clinically important influence on bone density in male patients with severe acne."
5684658	"The regulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) oscillations in the context of wound healing and carcinogenesis have been investigated in premalignant and malignant JB6 mouse epidermal cells stimulated with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA). In premalignant JB6 cells, bFGF stimulation (1) increases cellular phospho-ERK and phospho-c-Jun levels, (2) increases serum-dependent cell proliferation, (3) induces an apparent epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and (4) induces the persistent nuclear-cytosolic oscillation of an ERK1-green fluorescent protein (ERK1-GFP) chimera. In contrast, TPA induces persistent activation of ERK in the absence of oscillations and does not induce efficient migration. Treatment of malignant or transformed JB6 cells with bFGF is associated with a transient nuclear translocation of ERK1-GFP but not oscillations or efficient cell migration. Our data suggest that bFGF regulates ERK oscillations in premalignant but not malignant JB6 cells."
1176620	"Behçet's disease (BD) is a chronic inflammatory disease with unknown pathogenesis. As various functions of neutrophils in peripheral blood, such as chemotaxis, phagocytosis and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) increase in BD, ROS-mediated oxidative stress related to neutrophil activation may have an important role in the pathogenesis of BD.                                                                                   To investigate the importance of neutrophil activation as the main source of oxidative stress through protein oxidation in the pathogenesis of BD, and also to investigate whether one of the products of protein oxidation, advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), may be used as an activity marker for BD.                                                                              Patients with BD (n = 49), at active and inactive stages, with or without evidence of uveitis, and healthy volunteers (n = 40) were entered into the study. A full blood count, peripheral blood smears, routine biochemical analyses, C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) measurements were performed in all patients preceding the study. Plasma myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, representing neutrophil activation, and biomarkers of oxidative stress reflecting protein oxidation, such as levels of AOPP and thiol, were measured spectrophotometrically. Statistical comparisons were made using Mann-Whitney U-tests, Student's t-tests, anova/post-anova tests and correlation analyses.                                                                              In all patients, the results of full blood count, peripheral blood smears and routine biochemical analyses were in the normal range, but mean values of CRP and ESR were higher than laboratory reference values. Plasma MPO activity and AOPP levels were found to be higher and thiol values lower in the total patient group and individual subgroups than in controls. Patients with active BD had significantly higher MPO and AOPP levels and lower thiol levels than patients with inactive BD. There was no difference between uveitis-positive and uveitis-negative subgroups in MPO and thiol levels, but AOPP levels were lower in the latter group. Patients with active BD +/- uveitis were shown to have increased MPO and AOPP but decreased thiol levels in comparison with the inactive BD, uveitis-negative subgroup. There were strong positive correlations between ESR and CRP, ESR and MPO, ESR and thiol, ESR and AOPP, CRP and MPO, CRP and AOPP, MPO and AOPP, and thiol and AOPP levels in patients with BD.                                                                                      Based on this first study, in which MPO-mediated AOPP formation has been demonstrated, it may be suggested that activated neutrophils may play an important role in the pathogenesis of BD and that chlorinated oxidants of neutrophil origin may lead to oxidative stress, notably protein oxidation. Therefore, AOPP may be a useful marker for monitoring the progress and the severity of the disease activity."
5465812	"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the platform-switching technique to prevent crestal bone loss following the restoration of dental implants.                                                                                            This randomized prospective multicenter trial analyzed 60 partially edentulous adults recruited at 12 professional dental centers. Subjects were randomly selected to receive either platform-enlarged or control cylindric implants in three different surgical procedures: conventional nonsubmerged, submerged, and submerged with a reduced abutment. The primary outcome measure was the change in crestal bone level assessed radiographically 12 and 24 months following placement. Nonparametric analysis of variance for repeated measures (the Friedman test) was used to assess the overall significance over time of the differences among implants in changes in crestal bone levels. Comparisons among and between groups of implants were performed by the nonparametric Friedman and Wilcoxon tests, respectively. In all the analyses an alpha = .05 was considered significant.                                                                              A total of 360 implants were placed (60 for each group). Three control implants failed during the 2nd year following placement. All submerged and 92% of nonsubmerged platform-enlarged implants exhibited no bone loss. Control implants with an abutment as large as the implant platform exhibited more bone loss than their platform-enlarged counterparts (P <    .001) or control implants with a reduced abutment (P <    .001). Submerged implants with an enlarged platform showed better crestal bone preservation than submerged control implants with a reduced abutment (P = .06).                                                                                      The findings of the current trial indicated that the use of implants with an enlarged platform can result in better preservation of crestal bone as compared with conventional cylindric implants when a reduced abutment is mounted."
4681582	"Ex vivo expansion is being used to increase the number of stem and progenitor cells for autologous cell therapy. Initiation of pivotal clinical trials testing the efficacy of these cells for tissue repair has been hampered by the challenge of assuring safe and high-quality cell production. A strategy is described here for clinical-scale expansion of bone marrow (BM)-derived stem cells within a mixed cell population in a completely closed process from cell collection through postculture processing using sterile connectable devices. Human BM mononuclear cells (BMMNC) were isolated, cultured for 12 days, and washed postharvest using either standard open procedures in laminar flow hoods or using automated closed systems. Conditions for these studies were similar to long-term BM cultures in which hematopoietic and stromal components are cultured together. Expansion of marrow-derived stem and progenitor cells was then assessed. Cell yield, number of colony forming units (CFU), phenotype, stability, and multilineage differentiation capacity were compared from the single pass perfusion bioreactor and standard flask cultures. Purification of BMMNC using a closed Ficoll gradient process led to depletion of 98% erythrocytes and 87% granulocytes, compared to 100% and 70%, respectively, for manual processing. After closed system culture, mesenchymal progenitors, measured as CD105+CD166+CD14-CD45- and fibroblastic CFU, expanded 317- and 364-fold, respectively, while CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors were depleted 10-fold compared to starting BMMNC. Cultured cells exhibited multilineage differentiation by displaying adipogenic, osteogenic, and endothelial characteristics in vitro. No significant difference was observed between manual and bioreactor cultures. Automated culture and washing of the cell product resulted in 181 x 10(6) total cells that were viable and contained fibroblastic CFU for at least 24 h of storage. A combination of closed, automated technologies enabled production of good manufacturing practice (GMP)-compliant cell therapeutics, ready for use within a clinical setting, with minimal risk of microbial contamination."
5474819	"Chitosan, a deacetylated chitin derivative, behaves like a general elicitor, inducing a non-host resistance and priming a systemic acquired immunity. The defence responses elicited by chitosan include rising of cytosolic H(+) and Ca(2+), activation of MAP-kinases, callose apposition, oxidative burst, hypersensitive response (HR), synthesis of abscissic acid (ABA), jasmonate, phytoalexins and pathogenesis related (PR) proteins. Putative receptors for chitosan are a chitosan-binding protein, recently isolated, and possibly the chitin elicitor-binding protein (CEBiP). Nevertheless, it must be pointed out that biological activity of chitosan, besides the plant model, strictly depends on its physicochemical properties (deacetylation degree, molecular weight and viscosity), and that there is a threshold for chitosan concentration able to switch the induction of a cell death programme into necrotic cell death (cytotoxicity)."
7525247	"Sumoylation is a posttranslational regulatory process in higher eukaryotes modifying substrate proteins through conjugation of small ubiquitin-related modifiers (SUMOs). Sumoylation modulates protein stability, subcellular localization and activity; thus, it regulates most cellular functions including response to environmental stress in plants. To study the feasibility of manipulating SUMO E3 ligase, one of the important components in the sumoylation pathway in transgenic (TG) crop plants for improving overall plant performance under adverse environmental conditions, we have analysed TG creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.) plants constitutively expressing OsSIZ1, a rice SUMO E3 ligase. Overexpression of OsSIZ1 led to increased photosynthesis and overall plant growth. When subjected to water deficiency and heat stress, OsSIZ1 plants exhibited drastically enhanced performance associated with more robust root growth, higher water retention and cell membrane integrity than wild-type (WT) controls. OsSIZ1 plants also displayed significantly better growth than WT controls under phosphate-starvation conditions, which was associated with a higher uptake of phosphate (Pi) and other minerals, such as potassium and zinc. Further analysis revealed that overexpression of OsSIZ1 enhanced stress-induced SUMO conjugation to substrate in TG plants, which was associated with modified expression of stress-related genes. This strongly supports a role sumoylation plays in regulating multiple molecular pathways involved in plant stress response, establishing a direct link between sumoylation and plant response to environmental adversities. Our results demonstrate the great potential of genetic manipulation of sumoylation process in TG crop species for improved resistance to broad abiotic stresses."
3360760	"Events that induce expression of the metallothionein (MT) gene, such as injection of cadmium chloride, cold stress or topical application of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, can deplete the number of ultraviolet (UV) B-induced sunburn cells (SBC) in mouse skin in vivo. MT-null mouse skin explants exhibit reduced tolerance to UVB injury in vitro. However, the in vivo response of MT-null mice to UVB injury has not been investigated. In the present study, we investigated the role of the MT gene on UVB injury in vivo. MT-null mice that are deficient in MT-I and MT-II genes were studied and compared with homozygous wild-type mice. Mouse dorsal skin was irradiated with 0.05, 0.70 and 1.40 J/cm2 UVB. The thickness of the dorsal skin was measured with a spring micrometer before and 24 h after UVB irradiation. In addition, SBC were counted 24 h after UVB irradiation. No significant difference was found in the change of skin thickness between MT-null mice and control mice irradiated with low-dose UVB (0.05 J/cm2) (Student's t-test, t = 1.519, P = 0.167). At higher doses (0.70 and 1.40 J/cm2), the skin of MT-null mice became much thicker than that of control mice (Student's t-test, t = 6.576, P <    0.01 and t = 3.142, P = 0.007, respectively). More SBC were detected in MT-null mice skin irradiated with the highest dose of UVB (1.40 J/cm2) (Student's t-test, t = 4.258, P <    0.01). These results suggest that the MT gene in mice has a photoprotective role in vivo."
6985050	"A few studies have shown a high prevalence of thyroid autoimmunity in patients with psoriatic arthritis. However, thyroid autoimmunity has not been investigated in patients with psoriasis who do not have psoriatic arthritis. We aimed to investigate thyroid autoimmunity in patients with psoriasis. The study included 105 consecutive patients with psoriasis who did not have psoriatic arthritis and a sex and age matching control group consisting of 96 patients with tinea pedis. All of the patients with psoriasis were examined dermatologically and PASI scores were calculated for each patient. Free triiodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), antithyroglobulin (AbTG), and antithyroidperoxidase antibody (AbTPO) levels were measured in all of the subjects. The levels of TSH, FT3, FT4, AbTG and AbTPO and ultrasonographic findings of thyroid gland were compared statistically between psoriasis and control groups. Also, the levels of TSH, FT3, FT4, AbTG and AbTPO of psoriasis patients were compared with PASI scores. Mann-Whitney U test was used as statistical method. The mean age of patients with psoriasis was 40.54 +/- 16.91 years. 56 patients were female, 49 were male. The levels FT4 were found to be significantly increased in the patient group. But levels of AbTPO and AbTG were not statistically different between the two groups. The patients who had thyroiditis plus nodules in thyroid ultrasonography had statistically longer disease periods. This is the first study that investigated autoimmune thyroid disorders in patients with psoriasis who did not have arthritis. We believed that thyroid autoimmunity in patients with psoriasis was no different from that found in healthy individuals."

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Fractional CO(2) laser in eyelid tightening and periorbital wrinkles.                                                                              Forty-five patients received a range of 2-3 treatments in the upper, lower eyelids and periorbital area with a fractional laser device. Photographs were taken before and after each treatment and 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after the final treatment. The results were judged by three dermatologists who had not taken part in the treatments.                                                                              One year after the last laser session, all patients showed global improvements in eyelid skin tightening: five patients (11.1%) achieved excellent improvement, 11 patients (24.5%) marked improvement, 15 patients (33.3%) moderate improvement and 14 subjects (31.1%) slight improvement. At the 1-year follow-up, the percentage of subjects with a lift in their eyebrows and consequently a widened palpebral fissure was 82.2 (37 patients), whereas 17.8% (eight patients) showed no eyebrow elevation.

1045810	"Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a heterogeneous family of lymphoid tumours, among which the T and null cell types were recently listed in the REAL classification as a distinct entity. Reports on autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in this group are only occasional. Sixty-four patients with T and null cell ALCL from 25 European centres had been registered with the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) at the onset of this study. The median age was 25 years (range 3.2-53.0). Thirty of the 64 patients (47%) were in complete remission (CR), 18 (28%) in partial remission (PR), and the remaining 16 (25%) had a more advanced or chemotherapy-refractory disease at transplant. Eighty-one percent of the patients were conditioned with chemotherapy alone and 75% received marrow stem cells. All the patients transplanted in first CR (15), except one, maintained the CR over time; six of 15 transplanted in CR subsequent to first, six of 18 transplanted in PR and 14 of 16 transplanted in refractory or relapsed disease progressed. Actuarial overall survival (OS) at 10 years is 70%. Multivariate analysis showed that good status at transplant, younger age, absence of B symptoms and absence of extranodal disease indicated a better prognosis. These data suggest that ASCT should be considered as a possible treatment for chemosensitive patients in CR or PR. However, definitive conclusions cannot be drawn from this study and a prospective randomised trial between ASCT and conventional chemotherapy may be indicated."

AE maps to 8q24.3 and is associated with mutations in the intestinal zinc transporter ZIP4 encoded by the gene SLC39A4. We describe a novel homozygous mutation, 1191insC, in SLC39A4 in a patient from Sierra Leone and suggest that AE should be considered within the differential diagnosis for acrodermatitis in children from Sierra Leone. Genetic testing for this founder mutation can be easily performed for this treatable disorder."

Two fresh frozen cadaver heads were scanned using a CBCT (i-CAT(™) 3D Imaging System; Imaging Sciences International Inc.). The mandibles were sectioned and digitalized for histological evaluation. Dimensions as measured on these sections were compared with CBCT measurements of the same region with the use of 3D image-based planning software (Procera System NobelGuide(™); Nobel Biocare). To allow optimal comparison between histological and CBCT sections, reference markers were placed into the mandibles. The Student t-test was utilized to analyze the data. Differences with P-values <   0.05 were considered significant.                                                                              The total height and width of the mandibular body, as measured on CBCT views, were larger compared with the histological values with a maximum difference of 0.33 mm (SD ± 0.34). Cortical thickness measurements were significantly thicker on CBCT sections (P <    0.006) with absolute differences ranging up to ±0.63 mm (SD ±0.28) and relative differences ranging up to 82.6%.                                                                                     CBCT images (i-CAT 3D Imaging System), viewed on the planning software Procera System NobelGuide, tend to overestimate the anatomical truth in assessing both bone height and width; especially cortical thicknesses are depicted thicker than in reality. When using CBCT images for presurgical assessment, one should be aware of this phenomenon of exaggeration of dimensions."
9662131	"Efficient urine production after kidney transplantation is often evidence of good graft function. If severe organ injury occurs, we have oliguria or anuria and the patient requires postoperative hemodialysis. In most cases, graft function recovers after a few hemodialysis treatments-delayed graft function (DGF). Therefore, recognition of factors influencing the onset of DGF is crucial. We examined the state of the circulatory system by a thermodilution method in 101 organ donors, taking into account mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure (CVP), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), systemic vascular resistance index. We also examined 232 kidney recipients, based on age, gender, panel-reactive antibody, cold ischemia time, and reason for renal insufficiency. We defined DGF as at least one hemodialysis after kidney transplantation. In logistic regression analysis, we showed that donor MAP, CVP, and PCWP of the substantially influenced the occurrence of DGF among kidney transplant recipients. Maintaining an adequate MAP and a sufficient volume in the donor circulatory system substantially decreased the occurrence of DGF after kidney transplantation."
6918273	"Inflammatory insults following islet transplantation (ITx) hinders engraftment and long-term function of the transplanted (Tx) islets. Using a murine model of ITx, we determined the role of LMP-420, a novel TNF-α inhibitor, both individually and in combination with the immunosuppressant  cyclosporine A (CSA) in islet engraftment and survival. Diabetic C57BL/6 mice were Tx with 500 BALB/c islets under the kidney capsule. Four cohorts were used: LMP-420 only, CSA only, combination of LMP-420 and CSA (LMP+CSA), and control (n = 12 per cohort). Serial monitoring of blood  glucose levels revealed that LMP+CSA (35 ± 5 days) prolonged stable blood insulin levels compared to control (6 ± 4 days). Immunohistology demonstrated that coadministration (LMP+CSA) results in a significant decrease in CD8(+) T-cell infiltration (LMP+CSA: 31 ±  18 vs. control: 224 ± 51 cells, p <    0.001). Serum cytokine analysis revealed that LMP-420 administration resulted in an increase in the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (2.5-fold), and a decrease in TNF-α (threefold) with no change in IL-2. However, coadministration  resulted in a marked decrease in both IL-2 and TNF-α (threefold) along with increase in IL-10 (threefold). Coadministration also demonstrated increase of antiapoptotic SOCS-1 and Mn-SOD expression and significant reduction of donor-specific antibodies (p <    0.005). In conclusion,  LMP-420 administration with CSA results in the upregulation of anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic mechanisms which facilitate islet allograft engraftment and survival."
9647836	Fifty patients with seborrhoeic dermatitis were treated with 2% ketoconazole cream (n = 24) or with 1% hydrocortisone cream (n = 26) for 4 weeks in a double-blind comparative study. These twice daily applications resulted in 87.2% symptomatic improvement for hydrocortisone vs. 81.6% for ketoconazole. The number of P. ovale yeasts was significantly reduced after the application of ketoconazole compared with hydrocortisone. The incidence of side-effects was low in both groups.

Clinically, the mucinous lesions on the nape and upper trunk were localized papular mucinosis. Histologically, there was a perivascular infiltrate of lymphohistiocytic cells mingled with plasma cells in the upper dermis but no sclerosis. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that more than 90% of these infiltrating plasma cells produced immunoglobulin lambda-chain. Both the erythroderma and generalized mucinosis responded to topical steroid and PUVA therapy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of erythroderma accompanied by generalized mucinosis."

6488285	"Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory cutaneous disease with difficult-to-treat pruritus. Although phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4 inhibitors have an anti-inflammatory effect on inflammatory skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis, their acute antipruritic activities remain unclear. Therefore, in this study, we examined whether E6005, a novel PDE4 inhibitor, has antipruritic activity in dermatitis, using a mouse model of atopic dermatitis (NC/Nga mice). A single topical application of E6005 inhibited spontaneous hind-paw scratching, an itch-associated response and spontaneous activity of the cutaneous nerve in mice with chronic dermatitis. The cutaneous concentration of cAMP was significantly decreased in mice with chronic dermatitis, and this decrease was reversed by topical E6005 application. These results suggest that E6005 increases the cutaneous concentration of cAMP to relieve dermatitis-associated itching. Thus, E6005 may be a useful therapy for pruritic dermatitis such as atopic dermatitis."
9316438	"Abscisic acid (ABA) is an important phytohormone that functions in seed germination, plant development, and multiple stress responses. Arabidopsis Peroxisome defective 2 (AtPED2) (also known as AtPEXOXIN14, AtPEX14), is involved in the intracellular transport of thiolase from the cytosol to glyoxysomes, and perosisomal matrix protein import in plants. In this study, we assigned a new role for AtPED2 in drought stress resistance. The transcript level of AtPED2 was downregulated by ABA and abiotic stress treatments. AtPED2 knockout mutants were insensitive to ABA-mediated seed germination, primary root elongation, and stomatal response, while AtPED2 over-expressing plants were sensitive to ABA in comparison to wide type (WT). AtPED2 also positively regulated drought stress resistance, as evidenced by the changes of water loss rate, electrolyte leakage, and survival rate. Notably, AtPED2 positively modulated expression of several stress-responsive genes (RAB18, RD22, RD29A, and RD29B), positively affected underlying antioxidant enzyme activities and negatively regulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) level under drought stress conditions. Moreover, multiple carbon metabolites including amino acids, organic acids, sugars, sugar alcohols, and aromatic amines were also positively regulated by AtPED2. Taken together, these results indicated a positive role for AtPED2 in drought resistance, through modulation of stress-responsive genes expression, ROS metabolism, and metabolic homeostasis, at least partially."
3768971	"In view of the central pathogenic importance of leukocyte extravasation in inflammatory skin diseases, therapeutic interference with this - surprisingly complex - process is clearly a promising new approach for treating these dermatoses. Despite some disappointments during the clinical use of these agents and despite their crippling price tag, the recent incorporation of biologicals that target defined molecular controls of leukocyte extravasation into dermatological and rheumatological practise, consequently, has greatly enriched our therapeutic options for battling major, chronic, inflammatory dermatoses such as psoriasis. However, the - as yet unresolved and still rather controversially discussed - critical question is: Which of the multiple steps that control leukocyte extravasation in the human system really offer the most promising, most pragmatic, and safest molecular targets for therapeutic intervention for which disease entity? The current debate intends to stimulate public and rational debate of this crucial issue, beyond the evident commercial interests that are touched by whatever stand one takes."
4646781	"Strawberry flavor is one of the most popular fruit flavors worldwide, with numerous applications in the food industry. In addition, the biosynthetic origin of the most important strawberry flavor components, such as 2,5-dimethyl-4-hydroxy-2H-furan-3-one (DMHF), is a challenging research area. DMHF's precursor, 2-hydroxy-propanal (or lactaldehyde), is biosynthesized by the endophytic bacterium Methylobacterium extorquens (M. extorquens). In particular, the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) enzymes of M. extorquens are involved in the biogenesis of DMHF precursors since they have the capacity to oxidize the strawberry-derived 1,2-propanediol to lactaldehyde. In this study, the expression of the endophytic ADH and the plant DMHF biosynthesis genes was examined in the tissues of raw and ripe strawberry receptacles by in situ hybridization. The presence of endophytic bacteria was studied in the same tissues by probes targeting bacterial 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid. Hybridization signals of probes specific for endophytic ADH and plant DMHF biosynthesis genes, as well as bacteria-specific probes, were detected in the same locations. The probes were localized near the plasma membranes or intercellular spaces of cortical and vascular tissues of the receptacle, and intracellularly in the tissues of achenes. By localizing the expression of the endophytic methanol ADH and plant DMHF biosynthesis genes to the same tissues, we have reinforced our original hypothesis that an intimate symbiotic relationship between strawberry and endophytic cells exists and leads to the biosynthesis of DMHF."
8602568	"Several genomic analyses, high-throughput or targeted interaction studies including the purification of protein complexes indicated a physical and functional link between BolAs and monothiol glutaredoxins (Grxs) that is conserved both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In a recent work, we confirmed that several Arabidopsis protein couples, used as plant representatives, also physically interact. More interestingly, we determined that two BolA proteins, BolA2 and SufE1, contain a conserved cysteine that is sensitive to oxidizing treatments, unraveling a possible redox-control of BolA2 and SufE1 by monothiol glutaredoxins. By coexpressing physiological partners in E. coli, Grx-BolA heterodimers binding a labile, oxygen sensitive iron-sulfur cluster were isolated. Altogether, these results illustrate the existence of different modes of interaction between monothiol glutaredoxins and BolA proteins in plants and probably in other organisms. Incidentally, the function of each partner could be differentially modulated depending on the type of interaction."
7009784	"In this study we have used in situ hybridization with radiolabeled antisense RNA probes to examine the expression of mRNA for urokinase-type plasminogen activator and its receptor in histologic samples of squamous cell (n = 7) and basal cell (n = 7) carcinomas of the skin. Messenger RNA for both urokinase-type plasminogen activator and its receptor were expressed in all of the squamous cell carcinomas, but could not be detected in the basal cell carcinomas. In all of the seven squamous cell carcinomas a signal for urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor mRNA was detected focally in well-differentiated cancer cells surrounding keratinized pearls, and in four specimens urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor mRNA was in addition expressed by cancer cells at the edge of invasively growing strands of tumor. Urokinase-type plasminogen activator mRNA expression was found in virtually all the cancer cells of the squamous cell carcinomas, and importantly we found, by hybridizations for urokinase-type plasminogen activator and its receptor mRNA on adjacent sections of squamous cell carcinomas, that it was exactly the invading cancer cells that simultaneously expressed both these components required for plasmin-mediated proteolysis at the cell surface. We have previously shown that both urokinase-type plasminogen activator and its receptor mRNA are expressed by the leading-edge keratinocytes in regenerating epidermis during mouse skin wound healing, and that wound healing is impaired in mice made deficient in plasminogen by targeted gene disruption. We propose that there are similarities between the mechanisms of generation and regulation of extracellular proteolysis during skin re-epithelialization and squamous cell carcinoma invasion. The ability of the squamous carcinoma cells to mimic the ""invasive"" phenotype of re-epithelializing keratinocytes may be one of the factors that make squamous cell carcinomas more aggressive tumors than basal cell carcinomas."
6973530	"Vaspin is an adipokine implicated in vascular inflammation and remodeling. We herein evaluated the clinical correlation of serum vaspin levels in systemic sclerosis (SSc). Consistent with previous reports, 12% of subjects exhibited serum vaspin levels over 10 ng/mL, likely due to genetic effects. Excluding these subjects, despite no difference between SSc and control subjects, serum vaspin levels were significantly decreased in SSc patients with digital ulcers compared with those without, suggesting the potential contribution of vaspin to digital ulcers of this disease."
6835437	"Two genes encoding Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) DEAD-box RNA helicases were identified in a functional genomics screen as being down-regulated by multiple abiotic stresses. Mutations in either gene caused increased tolerance to salt, osmotic, and heat stresses, suggesting that the helicases suppress responses to abiotic stress. The genes were therefore designated STRESS RESPONSE SUPPRESSOR1 (STRS1; At1g31970) and STRS2 (At5g08620). In the strs mutants, salt, osmotic, and cold stresses induced enhanced expression of genes encoding the transcriptional activators DREB1A/CBF3 and DREB2A and a downstream DREB target gene, RD29A. Under heat stress, the strs mutants exhibited enhanced expression of the heat shock transcription factor genes, HSF4 and HSF7, and the downstream gene HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN101. Germination of mutant seed was hyposensitive to the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA), but mutants showed up-regulated expression of genes encoding ABA-dependent stress-responsive transcriptional activators and their downstream targets. In wild-type plants, STRS1 and STRS2 expression was rapidly down-regulated by salt, osmotic, and heat stress, but not cold stress. STRS expression was also reduced by ABA, but salt stress led to reduced STRS expression in both wild-type and ABA-deficient mutant plants. Taken together, our results suggest that STRS1 and STRS2 attenuate the expression of stress-responsive transcriptional activators and function in ABA-dependent and ABA-independent abiotic stress signaling networks."
2245724	"Anti-p200 pemphigoid is a recently defined autoimmune subepidermal blistering disease characterized by circulating and tissue-bound autoantibodies to a 200-kDa protein (p200) of the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ). This DEJ constituent is thought to be important for adhesion of basal keratinocytes to the underlying dermis. While the exact identity of p200 remains unknown, it has been demonstrated to be immunologically and biochemically distinct from all major autoantigens of the DEJ, including bullous pemphigoid antigens 180 and 230, laminin 1, 5 and 6, alpha6beta4 integrin, and type VII collagen. Clinically, most reported cases present with tense blisters as well as urticarial papules and plaques, closely resembling bullous pemphigoid. Histopathological examination of lesional skin biopsies shows subepidermal split formation and superficial inflammatory infiltrate typically dominated by neutrophils. Immunopathologically, linear deposits of immunoglobulin (Ig)G and C3 are detected along the DEJ by direct immunofluorescence microscopy of perilesional skin. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy of patients' sera on NaCl-split human skin demonstrates circulating IgG autoantibodies labeling the dermal side of the split. By immunoblotting, these autoantibodies recognize a 200-kDa protein of human dermis. Biochemical characterization of the p200 molecule revealed a noncollagenous N-glycosylated acidic protein with an isoelectric point of approximately 5.5. We present an overview of the pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis and treatment of this new disease entity."
8419841	"A 45-day-old male neonate (born 25 weeks and 5 days) presented with an annular, erythematosquamous eruption covering the head, neck, trunk, upper limbs and thighs. The eruption most resembled tinea corporis, however unusual the setting. Routine fungal culture grew Microsporum canis. No contacts could be identified. No previous case of tinea corporis had been seen in this neonatal unit, and very few reports are in the literature, particularly regarding this zoophilic organism. Our patient cleared with topical miconazole 2% cream applied twice daily for 24 days. This case highlights the importance of considering dermatophyte infection even in neonatal intensive care."
5642560	"As the current antipsoriatic medications are commonly associated with deleterious side-effects, a determined search for safer agents, which could be used alone or in combination with current antipsoriatic drugs, would be very imperative. Psoriasis is believed to be characterized by a type 1 cytokine pattern; interferon-gamma, interleukin (IL)-2 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha are predominantly expressed in this disorder. Nitric oxide, reactive oxygen species, histamine, leukotriene B4, and decreased [corrected] keratinocyte cyclic adenosine monophosphate/cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cAMP/cGMP) ratio are supposed to play roles in the pathogenesis of this disorder. Based on the immunopathogenesis of psoriasis, this paper introduces three novel, potential treatments for this clinical conundrum: (i) cannabinoids, which exert inhibitory effects on antigen processing and macrophage/T-cell interaction and also on the release of IL-2, TNF-alpha and nitric oxide from immune cells; (ii) loratadine, which is an antihistamine capable of increasing [corrected] the cAMP/cGMP ratio and the production of leukotriene B4; and (iii) allopurinol, which scavenges free radicals, inhibits the production of TNF-alpha, and downregulates the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and P2X7 receptors on monocytes/macrophages, which are involved in antigen presentation and production of the inflammatory response, respectively. Importantly, allopurinol, especially in combination with cyclosporin, has been shown to be effective against experimental autoimmune uveitis, which, like psoriasis, is a cell-mediated autoimmune disorder."
1573177	"The International Agency for Research on Cancer has identified artificial ultraviolet (UV) radiation as a class 1 carcinogen. The contribution of sunbeds to malignant melanoma has been estimated at 100 deaths per year in the U.K. The sunbed industry is growing and claims self-regulation.                                                                                   To explore the standards of operation and client protection for sunbed users.                                                                              An observational study of tanning parlour practices was conducted by Environmental Health Practitioners who made unannounced visits to the majority of known commercial tanning parlours in Northern Ireland (population 1.77 million) during July/August 2007. Descriptive statistics were produced and comparisons between groups were made using chi(2) analysis.                                                                              All 332 premises visited cooperated with the survey. The UV type in machines was unknown in 71.2% of premises while 15.6% reported using type 4, high-dose UV devices; 36.2% of premises did not regularly service sunbeds or were unsure. Unsupervised use of sunbeds was reported in 8.6% of parlours and 3.4% provided a home sunbed service. Eye protection was available in 97.6% of premises but 34.6% charged for the service and only 79.6% sanitized these between use. Of the responders 15.9% were members of the Sunbed Association. These were more likely to have maintenance records and operating manuals but were also more likely to provide a home sunbed service.                                                                                      This study highlights the need for improved standards of regulation of the sunbed industry to protect clients from excessive and dangerous levels of UV radiation in a population where the numbers of melanomas continue to rise."

9200643	"CYSTEINE BIOSYNTHESIS IN PLANTS TAKES PLACE IN THE THREE CELLULAR COMPARTMENTS WITH AUTONOMOUS PROTEIN BIOSYNTHESIS MACHINERY: cytosol, plastids and mitochondria. This sulfur-containing molecule is synthesized sequentially in these compartments by two enzymatic families, the serine acetyltransferases and the O-acetylserine(thiol) lyases. Each family consists of several isoforms that differ in subcellular localization and abundance. Why so many isoforms are required in plant cell for cysteine biosynthesis has remained unknown to date. The characterization of gene-specific knockout mutants has started to address this question. In our recent work, we have performed a detailed analysis of the Arabidopsis oas-a1 null mutant and showed that the antioxidant capacity of the cytosol is compromised, highlighting the contribution of cytosolic Cys in redox signaling."
7243558	"End-stage liver disease has metabolic complications associated with malnutrition, which involves a great loss of muscle mass. This complication can lead to changes in the diaphragm, which along with ascites may impair daily activities and result in global motor disability and physical inactivity of patients on the waiting list for liver transplantation.                                                                                   This study sought to delineate the profile of candidates for liver transplantation while on the waiting list at the Clinical Hospital of State University Campinas (UNICAMP), and to assess and verify whether there is a correlation between functional status of the individuals tested using the 6-minute walk test (6MWT), pulmonary function test (PFT), and respiratory muscle strength with end-stage liver disease candidates for liver transplantation.                                                                              This study was carried out in the Liver Transplantation Unit of the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP). We included 46 patients with end-stage liver disease who underwent the following evaluations: medical history, 6MWT, PFT, maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP), and SF-36.                                                                              Correlations were found between the respiratory variables 6MWT and PFT. The walked distance was correlated with MIP and MEP. There was no correlation between the 6MWT and the variables body mass index and age.                                                                                     Candidates for liver transplantation have decreased muscle strength, normal lung function, and impaired quality of life, mainly due to physical limitations. Functional status may be correlated with the respiratory assessment (muscle strength and pulmonary function test) in liver disease candidates for transplantation."
6778720	"The treatment of chronic bullous dermatosis of childhood (CBDC) so far has been limited to the use of corticosteroids and the sulfa group of drugs, e.g. daspsone and sulfapyridine. Furthermore, the therapy of CBDC cases with associated G6 PD deficiency is restricted only to systemic steroids. Histopathologically CBDC is characterized by the presence of predominantly neutrophilic infiltration and because it has been proven to exert strong anti-inflammatory effects through the inhibition of neutrophils, colchicine was mandated for its use in CBDC.                                                                              To avoid the detrimental side-effects of the long-term use of steroids in children, an alternative anti-inflammatory drug like colchicine was considered. Patients with G6 PD deficiency and those who were not satisfactorily controlled with steroid therapy, and who in addition developed unacceptable side-effects like cushingoid faces and hypertrichiosis, were treated with the drug.                                                                              Eight patients were given colchicine, five (62.5%) of which showed complete remission within 4-6 weeks of starting the therapy. The remaining three (37.5%) also responded but required adjuvant small doses of steroids to maintain the remissions. The drug was very well tolerated and no side-effects were observed.                                                                                      Colchicine is, therefore; found to be an effective treatment in CBDC and has enhanced our armamentarium of therapeutics for this condition, especially in children with G6 PD deficiency."
8355222	"We report 2 cases of parakeratosis variegata (PV) evolving from lesions beginning with characteristics of ashy dermatosis. Both patients presented with a reticulated, poikilodermatous and hyperpigmented eruption with bizarre coalescent lichenoid papules. Histology showed lichenoid epidermotropic infiltrates, more pronounced in case No. 1, consistent with early malignancy. The course was chronic: after more than 10 years, systemic symptoms were not present. In patient No. 1, a monoclonal T-cell population was detected 12 years after the onset of the disease. Both patients had close contact with fertilizers and insecticides. In patient No. 2, the lesions spontaneously regressed within 3 years after cessation of exposure. PV may be a prelymphomatous stage of mycosis fungoides or some closely related cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and does not always evolve into overt malignancy. Gene rearrangement detection techniques may be helpful in predicting the course of the disease."
5156428	"In order to clone the genes of peanut seed storage proteins, a cDNA library of mid-maturation stage cotyledons of peanut (Arachis hypogaea L. Shanyou 523) was constructed. After immunoscreening with polyclonal antibody against conarachin from peanut seeds, two cDNA sequences named Ahy alpha and Ahy beta of conarachin genes were obtained. BLAST these sequences in GenBank showed that they share high homology with the genes of legume 7S globulins. One of the sequences (Ahy beta) was found to be identical to part of the published complete cDNA sequence of the peanut allergen, Ara h1 p17. The other fragment (Ahy alpha) was almost identical to parts of the published complete cDNA sequence of the peanut allergen, Ara h1 p41b. Results of southern analysis show that they belong to a small gene family (the result is not shown). These sequences were expressed only in developing peanut seeds. To isolate the genes involved in seed storage protein and to understand the gene expression during peanut seed development, the sequences of 414 ESTs were determined and further analyzed by BLAST searches and categorized functionally. Five rESTs (representative ones) of arahin, two rESTs of conarachin and six rESTs of conglutin-like proteins were isolated. 17.0% of total transcripts isolated in this study are involved in peanut seed storage proteins."
9549201	"The beneficial effects of certain herbal medicines on cutaneous function have been appreciated for centuries. Among these agents, chrysanthemum extract, apigenin, has been used for skin care, particularly in China, for millennia. However, the underlying mechanisms by which apigenin benefits the skin are not known. In this study, we first determined whether topical apigenin positively influences permeability barrier homoeostasis, and then the basis thereof. Hairless mice were treated topically with either 0.1% apigenin or vehicle alone twice daily for 9 days. At the end of the treatments, permeability barrier function was assessed with either an electrolytic water analyzer or a Tewameter. Our results show that topical apigenin significantly enhanced permeability barrier homoeostasis after tape stripping, although basal permeability barrier function remained unchanged. Improved barrier function correlated with enhanced filaggrin expression and lamellar body production, which was paralleled by elevated mRNA levels for the epidermal ABCA12. The mRNA levels for key lipid synthetic enzymes also were upregulated by apigenin. Finally, both cathelicidin-related peptide and mouse beta-defensin 3 immunostaining were increased by apigenin. We conclude that topical apigenin improves epidermal permeability barrier function by stimulating epidermal differentiation, lipid synthesis and secretion, as well as cutaneous antimicrobial peptide production. Apigenin could be useful for the prevention and treatment of skin disorders characterized by permeability barrier dysfunction, associated with reduced filaggrin levels and impaired antimicrobial defenses, such as atopic dermatitis."
7621300	"There is a pressing need to find a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels that will not compromise food security or require extensive use of agrochemicals. Miscanthus is a perennial energy grass predominantly used for combustion but with the current advancement of ligno-cellulosic fermentation technologies there is an interest in using Miscanthus for bioethanol production. Currently, the only commercially grown genotype of Miscanthus is M.× giganteus; a high yielding, interspecific hybrid of M. sacchariflorus and M. sinensis. As M.× giganteus is a sterile triploid, it cannot be used as a parent so Miscanthus breeding effort is focused on producing new interspecific varieties that out-perform M.× giganteus. The carbohydrate profiles of four genotypes of Miscanthus, including M. sacchariflorus (Sac-5), M.× giganteus (Gig-311), M. sinensis (Sin-11) and M. sinensis (Goliath), were characterized at replicated field sites in Aberystwyth, West Wales and Harpenden, south-east England. Our hypothesis was that a distinctive carbohydrate profile underlies enhanced biomass accumulation. Biomass accumulation is greatest when day-lengths and solar intensity are highest; so, observations were made in the middle of UK summer (July) for 2 years. Gig-311 had a greater abundance of fructose in its stems at both sites, and both Gig-311 and Sac-5 had low abundance of starch. At both sites, the highest yielding genotype was Gig-311 and Sac-5 was also high yielding at Harpenden, but performed comparatively poorly at Aberystwyth. At both sites Gig-311 had a distinctly high concentration of fructose, low starch and a high ratio of soluble sugars: starch, and at Harpenden, Sac-5 was similar. We conclude that the abundance of starch and fructose and a greater partitioning of soluble sugars, relative to starch, are candidate biomarkers of productivity in Miscanthus."
5716292	"The molecular pathways responsible for the flowering response to photoperiod have been extensively studied in Arabidopsis thaliana and cereals but remain poorly understood in other major plant groups. Here, we describe a dominant mutant at the LATE BLOOMER2 (LATE2) locus in pea (Pisum sativum) that is late-flowering with a reduced response to photoperiod. LATE2 acts downstream of light signaling and the circadian clock to control expression of the main photoperiod-regulated FT gene, FTb2, implying that it plays a primary role in photoperiod measurement. Mapping identified the CYCLING DOF FACTOR gene CDFc1 as a strong candidate for LATE2, and the late2-1D mutant was found to carry a missense mutation in CDFc1 that impairs its capacity to bind to the blue-light photoreceptor FKF1 in yeast two-hybrid assays and delays flowering in Arabidopsis when overexpressed. Arabidopsis CDF genes are important negative regulators of CONSTANS (CO) transcription, but we found no effect of LATE2 on the transcription of pea CO-LIKE genes, nor on genes in any other families previously implicated in the activation of FT in Arabidopsis. Our results reveal an important component of the pea photoperiod response pathway and support the view that regulation of FTb2 expression by photoperiod occurs via a CO-independent mechanism."
5140277	"Antibodies against transcriptional intermediary factor (TIF)-1γ are associated with malignancy in dermatomyositis (DM). Identification of clinical findings associated with anti-TIF-1γ antibodies in DM is a high priority for both patient diagnosis and risk assessment.

Using a novel, sensitive, and specific assay for anti-TIF-1γ antibodies, we retrospectively tested plasma from 134 adult patients with DM and examined associations between anti-TIF-1γ antibodies and particular clinical and laboratory features.                                                                              In all, 55 (41%) patients had autoantibodies to TIF-1γ. Anti-TIF-1γ positive patients were less likely to have systemic features including interstitial lung disease, Raynaud phenomenon, and arthritis/arthralgia. Patients with TIF-1γ autoantibodies had more extensive skin involvement, and some patients manifested characteristic findings including palmar hyperkeratotic papules, psoriasis-like lesions and a novel finding of hypopigmented and telangiectatic (""red on white"") patches.

TIF-1γ is the most commonly targeted DM-specific autoantigen in adults in a large US cohort. Although these patients tend to have less systemic involvement, their skin disease is often extensive and characteristic. Recognition of cutaneous findings in anti-TIF-1γ positive patients may allow more accurate and timely diagnosis and effective treatment of patients with DM."
2530880	"Sclerotinia sclerotiorum causes a devastating disease in oilseed rape (Brassica napus) resulting in a tremendous yield loss worldwide. Studies on various host-pathogen interactions have shown that plant WRKY transcription factors are essential for defence. For the B. napus-S. sclerotiorum interaction, little direct evidence has been found with regard to the biological roles of specific WRKY genes in host resistance. In this study, we isolated a B. napus WRKY gene, BnWRKY33, and found that the gene is highly responsive to S. sclerotiorum infection. Transgenic B. napus plants overexpressing BnWRKY33 showed markedly enhanced resistance to S. sclerotiorum, constitutive activation of the expression of BnPR1 and BnPDF1.2, and inhibition of H2 O2 accumulation in response to pathogen infection. Further, we isolated a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase substrate gene, BnMKS1, and found that not only can BnWRKY33 interact with BnMKS1, which can also interact with BnMPK4, using the yeast two-hybrid assay, consistent with their collective nuclear localization, but also BnWRKY33, BnMKS1 and BnMPK4 are substantially and synergistically expressed in response to S. sclerotiorum infection. In contrast, the three genes showed differential expression in response to phytohormone treatments. Together, these results suggest that BnWRKY33 plays an important role in B. napus defence to S. sclerotiorum, which is most probably associated with the activation of the salicylic acid (SA)- and jasmonic acid (JA)-mediated defence response and inhibition of H2 O2 accumulation, and we propose a potential mechanism in which BnMPK4-BnMKS1-BnWRKY33 exist in a nuclear localized complex to regulate resistance to S. sclerotiorum in oilseed rape."
8027676	"Localized or pretibial myxedema is one of the signs of Graves disease (along with goiter, exophthalmus, thyroid acropathy, and high circulating levels of long-acting thyroid-stimulating hormone) and usually tends to occur at a later stage of the disease or even after the patient becomes euthyroid post treatment. Very rarely has it been reported in euthyroid patients. We report a euthyroid man presenting with localized myxedema on the extensor surface of his forearm with clinical and histopathological features consistent with pretibial myxedema. He responded partially to topical clobetasol propionate cream and tacrolimus ointment 0.1 percent for about 7 months. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of preradial myxedema in a euthyroid patient in the English international dermatological literature."

To report and assess 'functional' or 'conservative' surgery for NAMis and evaluate its long-term oncologic safety.                                                                              Retrospective study of cases diagnosed in the University Hospital Saint-Pierre collected over a 13 year period and compared with the published data.                                                                              Eleven cases of NAMis were identified: 73% concerned females. Thumb and first toe were the most affected digits (63% of total). Monodactylic longitudinal melanonychia (LM) was the most frequent presentation (92%). Mean diagnosis delay was 5 years. Diagnosis was suspected on the basis of clinical and dermatoscopic signs and was confirmed by pathological examination. All patients underwent complete nail unit removal with 6 mm security margins around the anatomic boundaries of the nail. Two late local recurrences were observed at 7 and 11 years follow-up.                                                                                      Our series, the largest up to now, demonstrates that 'functional surgery' is a rational approach for NAMis with an excellent oncologic safety at 5 years. However, this study suggests that a very long-term follow-up is mandatory, as recurrences may appear late."
5880907	"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) play a crucial role in hematopoietic development and have been shown to exert a powerful immunosuppressive effect. In this study, we investigated the effect of bone marrow MSC on the differentiation and function of peripheral blood monocytes into dendritic cells (DCs).                                                                              Human MSCs, generated from normal bone marrow, were added to peripheral blood monocytes stimulated in vitro with granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor and interleukin-4 to become DCs. Monocytes were then examined for the expression of markers characteristic of DCs and their ability to stimulate allogeneic T cells. In addition, the effect of MSCs on the cell cycle of monocyte-derived DCs and the expression of various cell cycle proteins were analyzed by cytometric analysis and Western blotting with specific antibodies.                                                                              MSCs blocked the differentiation of monocytes into DCs and impaired their antigen-presenting ability. This resulted from a block of monocytes from entering the G1 phase of the cell cycle with a progressive number of cells accumulating in the G0 phase. Cyclin D2 was downregulated. However, differently from what was observed in T-cells stimulated in the presence of MSCs, the expression of p27 was found decreased, suggesting the involvement of similar but not identical pathways.                                                                                      We conclude that MSCs impair monocyte differentiation and function by interfering with the cell cycle. These findings imply that MSC-induced immunosuppression might be a side product of a more general antiproliferative effect."
9323514	"The mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and its ligand aldosterone regulate renal sodium reabsorption and blood pressure and much knowledge has been accumulated in MR physiopathology, cellular and molecular targets. In contrast, our understanding of this hormonal system in non-classical targets (heart, blood vessels, neurons, keratinocytes...) is limited, particularly in the mammalian skin. We review here the few available data that point on MR in the skin and that document cutaneous MR expression and function, based on mouse models and very limited observations in humans. Mice that overexpress the MR in the basal epidermal keratinocytes display developmental and post-natal abnormalities of the epidermis and hair follicle, raising exciting new questions regarding skin biology. The MR as a transcription factor may be an unexpected novel player in regulating keratinocyte and hair physiology and pathology. Because its activating ligand also includes glucocorticoids, that are widely used in dermatology, we propose that the MR may be also involved in the side-effects of corticoids, opening novel options for therapeutical intervention."
4647428	"Long-term survival of fetal pig thymus (FP THY) grafts and efficient repopulation of mouse CD4+ T cells is achieved in thymectomized (ATX) B6 mice that receive T and NK cell depletion by injection of a cocktail of mAbs (GK1.5, 2.43, 30-H12, and PK136) and fetal pig thymus/liver (FP THY/LIV) grafts. The requirement for each mAb in this conditioning regimen in order to avoid the rejection of FP THY grafts has not yet been defined. In our present studies, CD4 cell-depleted ATX B6 mice and euthymic MHC class II-deficient (IIKO) mice were employed to investigate the role of mouse CD4+ cells in the rejection of FP THY grafts in vivo. After grafting FP THY/LIV to CD4+ cell-depleted ATX B6 mice, efficient repopulation of mouse CD4+ T cells was observed in the periphery. However, only two of four mice had remaining FP THY grafts by 17 weeks post-implantation, and these were of poor quality, whereas four of four T and NK cell-depleted ATX B6 mice had well-developed FP THY grafts. Furthermore, three of four FP THY/LIV-grafted, CD4+ cell-depleted ATX B6 mice rejected donor MHC-matched pig skin grafts. In contrast, three of three FP THY/LIV grafted, T and NK cell-depleted, ATX B6 mice accepted donor MHC-matched pig skin grafts, suggesting that optimal tolerance to xenogeneic pig antigens was not achieved in mice conditioned only with anti-CD4 mAb. ATX B6 mice treated with only anti-CD8 mAb rejected FP THY completely by 6 weeks post-grafting, a time when CD4+ cell-depleted ATX B6 mice had well-vascularized FP THY grafts. In addition, when euthymic IIKO mice were pre-treated with the standard conditioning regimen that includes four different mAbs, FP THY grafts survived and supported the repopulation of mouse CD4+ T cells in the periphery, while high levels of mouse CD8+ T cells developed in host thymi. These studies suggest that mouse CD4+ T cells play a critical role in the acute rejection of xenogeneic FP THY grafts. Without help from CD4+ cells, mouse CD8+ cells, NK, NK/T, and TCR(gamma/delta)+ T cells do not mediate acute rejection of FP THY grafts. Furthermore, our results suggest that other cell subsets besides CD4+ T cells play a role in the delayed rejection of highly disparate xenogeneic FP THY grafts."
9855109	"Recently, we found NHX1, the gene encoding a Na(+)/H(+) exchanger, participated in plant disease defense. Although NHX1 has been confirmed to be involved in plant salt tolerance, whether the NHX1 transgenic plants exhibit both salt tolerance and disease resistance has not been investigated. The T1 progenies of Nicotiana tabacum L. lines expressing SeNHX1 (from Salicornia europaea) were generated for the present study. Compared with PBI-type control plants, SeNHX1 transgenic tobaccos exhibited more biomass, longer root length, and higher K(+)/Na(+) ratio at post germination or seedling stage under NaCl treatment, indicating enhanced salt tolerance. The vacuolar H(+) efflux in SeNHX1 transgenic tobacco was increased after treatment of NaCl with different concentration. Meanwhile, the SeNHX1 transgenic tobaccos showed smaller wilted spot area, less H2O2 accumulation in leaves after infection of Phytophthora parasitica var. nicotianae. Further investigation demonstrated a larger NAD(P)(H) pool in SeNHX1 transgenic tobacco. These evidences revealed that overexpression of SeNHX1 intensified the compartmentation of Na(+) into vacuole under salt stress and improved the ability of eliminating ROS after pathogen attack, which then enhanced salt tolerance and disease resistance simultaneously in tobacco. Our findings indicate NHX1 has potential value in creating crops with both improved salt tolerance and disease resistance."
5770227	"Bright blue or red flowers in the Japanese morning glory (Ipomoea nil) contain anthocyanidin 3-O-sophoroside derivatives, whereas the reddish-brown or purplish-gray petals in its dusky mutants accumulate anthocyanidin 3-O-glucoside derivatives. The Dusky gene was found to encode a novel glucosyltransferase, UDP-glucose:anthocyanidin 3-O-glucoside-2''-O-glucosyltransferase (3GGT), which mediates the glucosylation of anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosides to yield anthocyanidin 3-O-sophorosides. Ipomoea nil carries one copy of the 3GGT gene that contains no intron and produces 1.6-kbp transcripts mainly in the petals and tubes of flower buds at around 24 h before flower opening. The gene products of both In3GGT in I. nil and Ip3GGT in the common morning glory (Ipomoea purpurea) comprise 459 amino acids and showed a close relationship to the petunia UDP-rhamnose:anthocyanidin 3-O-glucoside-6''-O-rhamnosyltransferase (3RT), which controls the addition of a rhamnose molecule to anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosides for conversion into anthocyanidin 3-O-rutinosides. All of the 30 dusky mutants tested were found to carry the 4-bp insertion mutations GGAT or CGAT at an identical position near the 3' end of the gene, and the insertions caused frameshift mutations. The expected 3GGT enzymatic activities were found in the crude extracts of Escherichia coli, in which the 3GGT cDNA of I. nil or I. purpurea was expressed, while no such activity was detected in the extracts expressed with the dusky mutant cDNAs containing 4-bp insertions. Moreover, the introduced Ip3GGT cDNA efficiently produced 3GGT that converted cyanidin 3-O-glucoside into cyanidin 3-O-sophoroside in transgenic petunia plants."
3343410	"Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation induces generation of reactive oxygen species, production of proinflammatory cytokines and melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) as well as increase in tyrosinase activity. The potential photoprotective effects of Coccoloba uvifera extract (CUE) were evaluated in UV-stimulated melanocytes.                                                                              Human epidermal melanocytes were used as an in vitro model to evaluate the effects of CUE on the production interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and alpha-MSH under basal and UV-stimulated conditions. Antioxidant and anti-tyrosinase activities were also evaluated in membrane lipid peroxidation and mushroom tyrosinase assay, respectively.                                                                              Coccoloba uvifera L. showed antioxidant and anti-tyrosinase activities and also inhibited the production of IL-1alpha, TNF-alpha and alpha-MSH in melanocytes subjected to UV radiation (P<   0.01). Moreover, CUE inhibited the activity of tyrosine kinase in cell culture under basal and UV radiation conditions (P<   0.001), corroborating the findings of the mushroom tyrosinase assay.                                                                                     This study supports the photoprotective potential of CUE."
9911350	"Transplant rejection is mediated by T-cell activation which is modulated by interleukin-2 (IL-2) binding to IL-2R (CD25). Monoclonal anti-IL-2 receptor antibody is used in renal transplantation to reduce rejection. Interestingly, proximal tubular epithelial cells (TEC) express CD25, similar to T cells. We have demonstrated that IL-2 induces murine TEC apoptosis through down-regulation of the caspase-8 inhibitor protein c-FLIP. Anti-CD25 antibody may be useful clinically to limit renal injury, but this has not been tested in human TEC.                                                                              Human PT-2 TEC were isolated and cloned from the urine of transplant patients. Apoptosis was determined by FACS with Annexin-V FITC. Protein expression was studied using western blot, and mRNA levels by quantitative real-time (PR-PCR).                                                                              We demonstrated that the morphology of a human kidney cell line (PT-2) cloned from urine was consistent with proximal TEC and expresses alkaline phosphatase, cytokeratin, vimentin, CD13, CD26, and low levels of E-cadherin. Basal IL-2 receptor (CD25) was up-regulated by IL-2/IFN-γ stimulation, and cytokine exposure induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Apoptosis with IL-2/IFN-γ was associated with increased caspase-8 activity and decreased endogenous caspase-8 inhibitor c-FLIP mRNA and protein expression. IL-2/IFN-γ-induced apoptosis could be blocked by pre-treatment of PT-2 with anti IL-2R antibody (basiliximab) but not control IgG antibody.                                                                                      These data demonstrate for the first time in human TEC that IL-2 and IFN-γ can induce TEC apoptosis which can be blocked by CD25 blockade antibody. These data suggest that anti-CD25 mAb might similarly attenuate inflammation-induced TEC injury in vivo. Kidney-expressed CD25 may represent a clinically important new target for attenuating early inflammatory injury in donor kidneys and preserving renal function during anti-rejection therapy."
8099454	"Peri-implant disease is a serious problem that plagues today's dentistry, both in terms of therapy and epidemiology. With the expansion of the practice of implantology and an increasing number of implants placed annually, the frequency of peri-implant disease has greatly expanded. Its clinical manifestations, in the absence of a globally established classification, are peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis, the counterparts of gingivitis and periodontitis, respectively. However, many doubts remain about its features. Official diagnostic criteria, globally recognized by the dental community, have not yet been introduced. The latest studies using metagenomic methods are casting doubt on the assumption of microbial equivalence between periodontal and peri-implant crevices. Research on most of the features of peri-implant disease remains at an early stage; moreover, there is not a commonly accepted treatment for it. In any case, although the evidence so far collected is limited, we need to be aware of the current state of the science regarding this topic to better understand and ultimately prevent this disease."
5522216	"The routine use of isoniazid prophylaxis after liver transplantation is a controversial issue because the benefits must be weighed against the risk of hepatotoxicity. We decided not to institute isoniazid prophylaxis but to study the efficacy of a surveillance mycobacterial program. One hundred patients were included in the protocol. Sputum and urine samples were processed before transplantation and on days 15, 30, 60, 90, 12, 150, and 180 for acid-fast stain and culture. One case of tuberculosis was promptly identified and successfully treated. Cases of tuberculosis with negative surveillance cultures were not identified. Our approach indicates that surveillance mycobacterial cultures can permit rapid identification of tuberculosis after liver transplantation and it is an alternative for groups who questioned isoniazid prophylaxis."
4367169	"In human skin, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) appears to be a key enzyme during wound healing and has roles in protection from infection. We speculated that diabetic skin complications such as delayed wound healing and skin infection were due to iNOS activity altered by high glucose in skin keratinocytes.                                                                                   The purpose of this study was to see how high levels of glucose affect iNOS activity in the human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT).                                                                              HaCaT cells were exposed to high glucose for 1 day or 10 days. We measured nitric oxide (NO) end product nitrite in the culture medium using the Griess reagent, and intracellular tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4), a cofactor of NOS) content by using high-performance liquid chromatography, analysed the expression level of iNOS mRNA by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction method and evaluated the DNA binding activity of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) by enzyme-immunoassay.                                                                              Short-term exposure (1 day) to a high level of glucose increased BH(4) and iNOS activity at the post-translational level. However, long-term exposure (10 days) to high glucose downregulates NF-kappaB binding activity and inhibits iNOS transcription and its activity.                                                                                      Pretreatment with high glucose for 10 days down-regulated NF-kappaB activity and inhibited iNOS transcription and NO production, implying the involvement of a deficiency in NO synthesis in both skin infection and impaired wound healing in diabetic patients."
8371261	"Eosinophilic pustular folliculitis (EPF), also known as Ofuji disease, is a disease that manifests with follicular papules or pustules. Its variants include a classic type that occurs most commonly in Japan, an HIV-associated type, an infantile type, a type that occurs on the palms and soles, a rare medication-associated variant, and a rare neoplasia-associated variant.A wide range of medications has been used to treat EPF. Topical corticosteroids are the first-line treatment option for EPF. Topical tacrolimus seems to be useful initial therapy as well. Oral indometacin (50-75 mg/day) is an effective treatment of classic EPF although it can induce peptic ulcers. For treatment of HIV-associated EPF when topical corticosteroids and indometacin do not work, various other treatments should be considered. These treatment options include cetirizine 20-40 mg/day, metronidazole 250 mg three times a day, itraconazole starting at a dosage of 200 mg/day and increasing to 300-400 mg/day, and topical permethrin. If these treatments do not work phototherapy with UVB is the 'gold standard' of treatment and is often curative. Treatments with less certain risk-benefit ratios but with some efficacy include PUVA (psoralen + UVA) photochemotherapy, oral corticosteroids, synthetic retinoids (i.e. isotretinoin 1 mg/kg/day), and acitretin (0.5 mg/kg/day), oral cyclosporine (ciclosporine) 5 mg/kg/day, interferon (IFN)-alpha-2b, and IFNgamma. Minocycline 100mg twice daily and dapsone 50-100mg twice daily have been used with some effect. The use of highly active antiretroviral therapy for HIV has resulted in the amelioration of EPF as CD4 cell counts rise above 250/mm(3). The diversity of clinical presentations and affected populations make it seem that EPF is a reaction pattern as much as a disease and that therapy should be tailored to the variant of EPF and the underlying etiology."
6052223	"Thiamine or vitamin B-1, is an essential constituent of all cells since it is a cofactor for two enzyme complexes involved in the citric acid cycle, pyruvate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Thiamine is synthesized by plants, but it is a dietary requirement for humans and other animals. The biosynthetic pathway for thiamine in plants has not been well characterized and none of the enzymes involved have been isolated. Here we report the cloning and characterization of two cDNAs representing members of the maize thi1 gene family encoding an enzyme of the thiamine biosynthetic pathway. This assignment was made based on sequence homology to a yeast thiamine biosynthetic gene and by functional complementation of a yeast strain in which the endogenous gene was inactivated. Using immunoblot analysis, the thi1 gene product was found to be located in a plastid membrane fraction. RNA gel blot analysis of various tissues and developmental stages indicated thi1 expression was differentially regulated in a manner consistent with what is known about thiamine synthesis in plants. This is the first report of cDNAs encoding proteins involved in thiamine biosynthesis for any plant species."
5179862	"Mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC), including phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation and HLA-A and HLA-B loci typing of donor and recipient, were performed on 70 renal allograft recipients and relevant family members. Graft survival was correlated retrospectively with matchnd PHA response index (PHARI), in order to assess the clinical relevance of each variable singly or jointly. Overall graft survival was significantly associated with SI (log10) (P less than 0.001) and matching grade (P = 0.027). No significant association with either PHARI or II was detected (P greater than 0.10). In addition, the product of the last two indices--the lymphocyte response index (LRI)--was not found to be related to graft survival (P greater than 0.10). Survival of grafts with one-haplotype identity was significantly associated with SI (P = 0.002). Survival in this group was not found to be related to II, PHARI, or LRI, considered either alone or jointly (P greater than 0.10). Grafts with two-allele-identical grafts, whereas PHARI did not differ. SI and matching grade were related significantly to graft survival and appeared to be the most important variables."
2065052	"Starch production in all plants examined is altered by mutations of isoamylase-type starch-debranching enzymes (DBE), although how these proteins affect glucan polymer assembly is not understood. Various allelic mutations in the maize (Zea mays) gene sugary1 (su1), which codes for an isoamylase-type DBE, condition distinct kernel phenotypes. This study characterized the recessive mutations su1-Ref, su1-R4582::Mu1, and su1-st, regarding their molecular basis, chemical phenotypes, and effects on starch metabolizing enzymes. The su1-Ref allele results in two specific amino acid substitutions without affecting the Su1 mRNA level. The su1-R4582::Mu1 mutation is a null allele that abolishes transcript accumulation. The su1-st mutation results from insertion of a novel transposon-like sequence, designated Toad, which causes alternative pre-mRNA splicing. Three su1-st mutant transcripts are produced, one that is nonfunctional and two that code for modified SU1 polypeptides. The su1-st mutation is dominant to the null allele su1-R4582::Mu1, but recessive to su1-Ref, suggestive of complex effects involving quaternary structure of the SU1 enzyme. All three su1- alleles severely reduce or eliminate isoamylase-type DBE activity, although su1-st kernels accumulate less phytoglycogen and Suc than su1-Ref or su1-R4582::Mu1 mutants. The chain length distribution of residual amylopectin is significantly altered by su1-Ref and su1-R4582::Mu1, whereas su1-st has modest effects. These results, together with su1 allele-specific effects on other starch- metabolizing enzymes detected in zymograms, suggest that total DBE catalytic activity is the not the sole determinant of Su1 function and that specific interactions between SU1 and other components of the starch biosynthetic system are required."
2350666	"Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is a maternally inherited defect in pollen production specified by novel mitochondrial genes. It can be suppressed by nuclear restorer (Rf) genes which normally downregulate expression of a CMS-associated novel mitochondrial gene. Two forms of Brassica napus CMS, nap and pol, are associated with related chimeric genes, orf222 and orf224, respectively. We show that in pol and nap CMS, anther locule development is asynchronous and asymmetric, that one or more locules within each anther may fail to develop entirely and that CMS anthers display polarity in locule development. We show, by in situ hybridization, that orf222 transcripts accumulate in sterile anthers prior to development of morphological differences between CMS and restored stamens, and remain preferentially localized to microsporangia. In fertility-restored anthers, however, orf222 transcript levels remain low throughout development. Some sporogenous and meiotic cells differentiate within CMS anthers and form functional pollen despite retaining high orf222 transcript levels, suggesting that the effect of orf222 expression in blocking pollen development is limited to an early and specific stage. Transcripts of other mitochondrial genes, exemplified by atp6 and cob, and of the nuclear-encoded ATP synthase gamma subunit, accumulate preferentially in the microsporangia of both sterile and fertile anthers. Thus nuclear fertility restoration reduces orf222 transcript levels in a gene and tissue-specific manner. We observe differences between CMS and fertile plants in the timing and patterning of APETALA3 promoter activity that suggest a possible basis for the developmental abnormalities of CMS flowers."
8206440	"We have shown previously that human desmocollin (Dsc) 1 is recognized by IgA autoantibodies of subcorneal pustular dermatosis (SPD) type IgA pemphigus. However, the presence of IgG anti-Dsc autoantibodies is still controversial, and antibodies to Dsc2 and Dsc3 have not been clearly identified.                                                                                   To investigate this by producing recombinant proteins consisting of the entire extracellular domains of human Dsc1, 2 and 3 in baculovirus, and to use them to establish an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).                                                                              By this ELISA, we examined in total 165 cases of various types of autoimmune bullous diseases, as well as 23 normal controls.                                                                              None of 45 sera of classical pemphigus showed either IgG or IgA antibodies to any Dsc. In contrast, one atypical pemphigus serum showed both IgG and IgA antibodies to Dsc1, which were adsorbed by incubation with Dsc1 baculoprotein. Furthermore, this ELISA detected both IgA and IgG anti-Dsc3 antibodies in one atypical case, and IgA antibodies to both Dsc2 and Dsc3 in another. This reactivity was confirmed by positive IgA immunofluorescence with Dsc2 and Dsc3 expressed on COS-7 cells. These results show that both IgG and IgA autoantibodies against all of Dsc1-3 are present in the sera of particular cases of nonclassical pemphigus, except for IgG antibodies to Dsc2, but that they are not detected in classical pemphigus. Unexpectedly, although IgA antibodies of all of eight SPD type IgA pemphigus sera reacted with Dsc1 expressed on COS-7 cells, only one serum was positive in Dsc1 ELISA for IgA.                                                                                      This result indicates either that Dscs expressed by baculovirus may not adopt the correct conformation or that Dscs may need association with other molecules to express all the epitopes for autoantibodies."
7045174	"We studied long-term pulmonary function testing (PFT) in a retrospective cohort of 6-month survivors of allogeneic marrow transplant (BMT) between 1980 and 1997. Of 593 patients, 73, 71 and 65% had adequate data to assess for obstruction, restriction and diffusion impairments respectively. Over 5 years, mean declines in 1-s forced expiratory volume/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC), total lung capacity (TLC) and diffusion were 4, 7 and 17%, respectively. TLC and diffusion tended to subsequently increase. In all, 6, 12 and 35% of patients met criteria for obstruction, restriction and impaired diffusion, respectively. Obstruction was less common in recent transplants (5 vs 15%, P=0.004), while restriction and diffusion impairment rates remained stable. There was significantly greater mortality with obstruction (HR 2.0 (1.04-3.95)), and a nonstatistically significant higher mortality rate with restriction (HR 1.6 (0.95-2.75)), but not with impaired diffusion (HR=0.99 (0.65-1.50)). cGVHD (OR 16.7 (2.2-129.8)) and busulfan (OR 2.9 (1.01-8.24)) were associated with obstruction. Marrow from nonsibling or mismatched donors (OR 4.9 (2.2-10.7)) was associated with restriction. In summary, after BMT, decreased diffusion capacity is common and benign; obstruction has decreased in frequency, is rare without cGVHD, and is associated with mortality; nonsibling and mismatched donor are risk factors for restriction."

Optimal management of actinic keratoses requires data on the efficacy of the numerous techniques employed in their treatment. Evaluating treatment efficacy requires before and after treatment quantification of actinic keratoses. Studies on the therapy and natural history of actinic keratoses have quantified these lesions by counting them. Counting actinic keratoses is unreliable because this technique lacks interobserver reproducibility. Consequently, studies based on counting actinic keratoses are fatally flawed and their conclusions of doubtful accuracy. Counting actinic keratoses should be abandoned as a technique for evaluating the therapy of actinic keratoses and the issue of spontaneous regression of actinic keratoses. A technique for reliably quantifying actinic keratoses is sorely needed."
6619478	"Developmental nail abnormalities are extremely heterogeneous, with hereditary isolated conditions being a small and rare subgroup. An unusual congenital nail dysplasia observed in a large South German kindred was characterized clinically to review the question of uniqueness.                                                                             Case series of affected family members.

The history and clinical features in 22 affected family members (13 females and 9 males, aged 5 to 74 years) were recorded and documented by photographs. Nail biopsy samples were taken from 2 patients.

The pedigree spanning 5 consecutive generations was best compatible with autosomal dominant inheritance with complete penetrance. Nail alterations were mostly present since birth and soon reached an individually variable degree of severity. Affected persons showed longitudinal streaks and thinning of nail plates, mostly of all fingernails and toenails, with some accentuation of the thumbnail and big toenails, poorly developed lunulae, longitudinal angular ridges of individual nail plates occasionally starting proximally from a reddish prominence, platonychia and koilonychia of individual nails often overgrowing the lateral folds, and notches and fissures of the free margins. Histological abnormalities included a prominent granular layer of the nail matrix and epithelial strands and buds extending from the nail bed. There were no associated anomalies. Other nail dystrophies were excluded by differences in clinical and histological features.                                                                                     The nail abnormality observed in our family represents a new autosomal dominant disorder for which we propose the term isolated congenital nail dysplasia. Arch Dermatol. 2000;136:1239-1243"
4306179	"In vitiligo, the autoimmune destruction of epidermal melanocytes produces white spots that can be repigmented by melanocyte precursors from the hair follicles, following stimulation with UV light. We examined by immunofluorescence the distribution of melanocyte markers (C-KIT, DCT, PAX3, and TYR) coupled with markers of proliferation (KI-67) and migration (MCAM) in precursors and mature melanocytes from the hair follicle and the epidermis of untreated and narrow band UVB (NBUVB)-treated human vitiligo skin. NBUVB was associated with a significant increase in the number of melanocytes in the infundibulum and with restoration of the normal melanocyte population in the epidermis, which was lacking in the untreated vitiligo. We identified several precursor populations (melanocyte stem cells, melanoblasts, and other immature phenotypes), and progressively differentiating melanocytes, some with putative migratory and/or proliferative abilities. The primary melanocyte germ was present in the untreated and treated hair follicle bulge, whereas a possible secondary melanocyte germ composed of C-KIT+ melanocytes was found in the infundibulum and interfollicular epidermis of UV-treated vitiligo. This is an exceptional model for studying the mobilization of melanocyte stem cells in human skin. Improved understanding of this process is essential for designing better treatments for vitiligo, ultimately based on melanocyte stem cell activation and mobilization."
5813038	"Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome (WSS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by alopecia, hypogonadism, diabetes mellitus, intellectual disability, sensorineural deafness, extrapyramidal signs, and low insulinlike growth factor 1 levels. Inter- and intrafamilial phenotypic variability have been reported. Mutations in the C2orf37 gene cause WSS. The present report describes the clinical signs and symptoms of three affected siblings from a consanguineous Bedouin family from Kuwait. Direct sequencing of the C2orf37 gene revealed that the c.436delC (p.Ala147Hisfs*9) mutation was present in a homozygous state in all affected siblings and in a heterozygous state in the parents and a healthy sister. Nine C2orf37 mutations causing WSS have been identified. This family shared the mutation reported earlier in Saudi families and families of Bedouin tribes from Qatar and Israel. No phenotypic or genotypic correlation has been observed. Despite the great phenotypic variability of WSS, hypotrichosis has been observed in all individuals with WSS reported. This condition has not been reported in the dermatologic literature. WSS should be included in the differential diagnosis of syndromic congenital hypotrichosis."

This was a twelve-week, randomized, double-blind study. Patients aged 12 years and older (n=301) applied dapsone gel twice daily and were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to one of three additional treatments, applied once daily.                                                                              By week 12, dapsone gel combined with any of the three additional treatments reduced the mean number of inflammatory lesions. However, the authors did not detect a significant difference in the reduction of inflammatory lesions when dapsone was used in combination with adapalene gel or with benzoyl peroxide gel compared to the dapsone plus moisturizer combination group (P=0.052 for both versus moisturizer combination). Patients treated with dapsone gel combined with adapalene showed a significantly better response in reduction in non-inflammatory and total acne lesion count than those who received the moisturizer combination. Local adverse reactions in all three treatment groups were minimal and generally mild in severity.                                                                                     Dapsone gel in combination with adapalene gel or benzoyl peroxide gel is safe and well tolerated for the treatment of acne vulgaris."
4074589	"The Arabidopsis thaliana genes PROTEIN INHIBITOR OF ACTIVATED STAT LIKE1 (PIAL1) and PIAL2 encode proteins with SP-RING domains, which occur in many ligases of the small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) conjugation pathway. We show that PIAL1 and PIAL2 function as SUMO ligases capable of SUMO chain formation and require the SUMO-modified SUMO-conjugating enzyme SCE1 for optimal activity. Mutant analysis indicates a role for PIAL1 and 2 in salt stress and osmotic stress responses, whereas under standard conditions, the mutants show close to normal growth. Mutations in PIAL1 and 2 also lead to altered sulfur metabolism. We propose that, together with SUMO chain binding ubiquitin ligases, these enzymes establish a pathway for proteolytic removal of sumoylation substrates."
9907152	"Dof proteins are transcription factors that have a conserved single zinc finger DNA-binding domain. In this study, we isolated an activation tagging mutant Dof5.1-D exhibiting an upward-curling leaf phenotype due to enhanced expression of the REV gene that is required for establishing adaxial-abaxial polarity. Dof5.1-D plants also had reduced transcript levels for IAA6 and IAA19 genes, indicating an altered auxin biosynthesis in Dof5.1-D. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay using the Dof5.1 DNA-binding motif and the REV promoter region indicated that the DNA-binding domain of Dof5.1 binds to a TAAAGT motif located in the 5'-distal promoter region of the REV promoter. Further, transient and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays verified binding activity of the Dof5.1 DNA-binding motif with the REV promoter. Consistent with binding assays, constitutive over-expression of the Dof5.1 DNA-binding domain in wild-type plants caused a downward-curling phenotype, whereas crossing Dof5.1-D to a rev mutant reverted the upward-curling phenotype of the Dof5.1-D mutant leaf to the wild-type. These results suggest that the Dof5.1 protein directly binds to the REV promoter and thereby regulates adaxial-abaxial polarity."
1732395	"The purpose of this study is to quantify ultraviolet (UV) exposure of several groups of amateur athletes in their training or recreational schedules.                                                                              The athletes were monitored using dosimeters (VioSpor).The study took place in Valencia, Spain, from May to July 2010, and involved a group of 10 mountaineers, four tennis players and five runners.                                                                              The mean daily personal UV exposure for mountaineers was 9.48 ± 3.23 standard erythema dose (SED). The tennis players received a mean of 10.65 ± 1.57 SED for every 2 days of training, and the runners received a mean of 7.62 ± 4.28 SED for every 5 days of training.                                                                                     Mountaineers received a higher dose of UV exposure and have a higher exposure ratio than the tennis players, probably because they spent more time outdoors. However, the runners received a low dose of UV exposure, perhaps because their training takes place in the evening. Mean daily UV exposure of the mountaineers and tennis players exceeded 5 SED, which means that, in the case of non-sun-adapted skin type III and the non-use of sun protection, erythema may be induced in these subjects. Accordingly, it is necessary to encourage the use of high protection sunscreens and protective clothing, and to avoid UV exposure in the hottest part of the day."
9228300	"Sequential therapy is a treatment strategy involving the use of specific therapeutic agents in a deliberate sequence to optimize the therapeutic outcome. The rationale for this strategy in psoriasis is that it is a chronic disease requiring long-term maintenance therapy as well as quick relief of symptoms and that some therapies available for psoriasis are better suited for rapid clearance while others are more appropriate for long-term maintenance. Sequential therapy involves 3 main steps: (1) the clearing, or ""quick-fix"" phase; (2) the transitional phase; and (3) the maintenance phase. In the example of sequential systemic therapy described in this article, an acute exacerbation of psoriasis is brought under control promptly with the use of cyclosporine at maximum dermatologic dose (5 mg/kg daily). After 1 month, the transitional phase is initiated with the gradual introduction of acitretin as a maintenance agent. Once the maximum tolerated dose of acitretin has been established, cyclosporine is gradually tapered and acitretin is continued for long-term maintenance with phototherapy (UVB or PUVA) added for improved control if needed. The author proposes sequential therapy with cyclosporine and acitretin as a viable option for patients with psoriasis who require systemic therapy and desire an alternative to methotrexate."
6512390	"During recent years, an increasing number of transplant centers within the Eurotransplant organization have used histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) solution instead of University of Wisconsin (UW) solution as their preferred cold storage solution for abdominal organ preservation. We report on our single-center experience on the outcome of imported kidneys preserved with either HTK or UW solution in relation to the duration of cold ischemia time (CIT).                                                                              Between July 1989 and July 1997, 323 cadaveric kidneys preserved with UW or HTK and imported as a result of an exchange within the Eurotransplant organization were transplanted at our institution. CIT was <   24 hr in 216 kidneys (UW: n=174, HTK: n=42) and >    or =24 hr in 107 kidneys (UW: n=67, HTK: n=40). Renal functional outcome was evaluated by comparing delayed graft function and initial non-function rates, daily urinary output, the evolution of serum creatinine, and creatinine clearance at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14 days and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months, and graft survival at 1 year after transplantation in relation to the type of cold storage solution and CIT <    or >    or =24 hr.                                                                              Whereas the incidence of delayed graft function did not differ significantly between kidneys preserved for less than 24 hr in UW (18.6%) or HTK (26.2%), this rate increased to 50% in HTK kidneys compared to 23.9% in UW kidneys when CIT exceeded 24 hr (P=0.006). Mean serum creatinine and creatinine clearance values were better at 1 and 5 days postoperatively in kidneys preserved <   24 hr with UW as compared to HTK (P<   0.05). After 24 hr of CIT, HTK-preserved kidneys showed an impaired renal function, not only in the immediate postoperative phase but also at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after transplantation (P<   0.05). Graft survival at 1 year was 92.9% in UW vs. 87.5% in HTK kidneys preserved for <   24 hr (NS), and 91% vs. 77.4% when CIT exceeded 24 hr (P=0.059).                                                                                      From these single-center findings, it can be concluded that UW is superior to HTK in kidney preservation, particularly when CIT exceeds 24 hr."
5664339	"Mechanisms leading to nonhost resistance of plants against nonadapted pathogens are thought to have great potential for the future management of agriculturally important diseases. In this article, we report an investigation of nonhost resistance motivated by the advantages of studying an interaction between two model organisms, namely Arabidopsis thaliana and Magnaporthe oryzae. During the course of our studies, however, we discovered an unexpected plasticity in the responses of Arabidopsis against this ostensibly nonhost pathogen. Thus, we elucidated that certain experimental conditions, such as the growth of plants under long days at constantly high humidity and the use of high inoculum concentrations of M. oryzae conidia, forced the interaction in leaves of some Arabidopsis ecotypes towards increased compatibility. However, sporulation was never observed. Furthermore, we observed that roots were generally susceptible to M. oryzae, whereas leaves, stems and hypocotyls were not infected. It must be concluded, therefore, that Arabidopsis roots lack an effective defence repertoire against M. oryzae, whereas its leaves possess such nonhost defence mechanisms. In summary, our findings point to organ-specific determinants and environmental conditions influencing the effectiveness of nonhost resistance in plants."
2342156	"The aim of this study was to analyze the semen variables and hormone profiles in kidney transplanted male adolescents. Eight post-pubertal male patients who underwent successful renal tx during the peripubertal period and who had ESRD during childhood were enrolled in the study. Patients who underwent tx before 14 yr old (group I) and patients who underwent tx after 14 yr old (group II) were evaluated separately. Semen was collected and analyzed. Serum levels of LH, FSH, and testosterone were measured and found to be normal in all patients except one. The mean age at the diagnosis of CKD was six yr and 13 yr in groups I and II, respectively. The mean age at the time of tx was 12 yr in the first and 17.8 yr in the second group. The patients in group I had received prednisone, cyclosporine A and azathioprine with a longer duration of time compared with patients in group II. Sperm counts (15.5 +/- 15.7 vs. 82.3 +/- 64.2 millions/mL) and sperm motilities (37.8 +/- 30.9 vs. 57.8 +/- 22.1%) were lower in group I than group II. Only one patient in group II had normal sperm parameters and azospermia was observed in one patient from group I. We conclude that the earlier onset and the longer duration of uremia, the more impairment of reproductive function. Also, it seems that duration of exposure to corticosteroids or cyclosporine combined with azathioprine contribute to sperm dysfunction in peripubertal transplanted boys."
8382373	"The pathogenesis of scleroderma is still elusive, although autoimmune mechanism involvement has been suggested. The present study was designed to investigate whether or not rat scleroderma would appear as one of the symptoms in a recently described model for autoimmune disease. The model is based on manipulation or reconstitution of the immune system after lethal irradiation and syngeneic bone marrow transplantation by temporary administration of the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine-A. Withdrawal of cyclosporine-A 6-12 wk after bone marrow transplantation gives rise to autoimmune reactions causing clinical pathology similar to graft-versus-host disease. We discuss the chronic phase of this disease, approximately 30 wk after cyclosporine-A was withheld at that time-about one-third of the rats had developed histologic skin lesions comparable to those seen in patients with scleroderma. Therefore, we propose this model as a new, experimental autoimmune model for scleroderma in humans."
5731022	"Adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is a poor prognosis T cell malignancy. In order to improve the outcome, we employed allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) for ATL in 10 patients, nine of whom were from HLA-identical siblings and one from an unrelated donor. Conditioning regimens varied among the patients except that all received total body irradiation. The patients tolerated the regimens well with mild, if any toxicity, and engraftment occurred in all cases. Median leukemia-free survival after allo-SCT was 17.5+ months (range 3.7-34.4+). Six of the 10 patients developed acute GVHD (one case each with grade I, III or IV, and three cases with grade II) and three patients developed extensive chronic GVHD. Four patients died after allo-SCT during the study period from either acute GVHD (grade IV), pneumonitis, gastrointestinal bleeding or renal insufficiency. Two of the 10 cases with no symptoms of GVHD relapsed with clinical ATL. These results strongly suggest that allo-SCT may improve the survival in ATL if a controlled degree of GVHD develops."
5623516	"A circulating lupus anticoagulant factor was detected in a 38-year-old man with end-stage renal disease and a 'lupus-like' syndrome with a diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis. When treated with steroids, the 'lupus' complications were controlled and the anticoagulant factor disappeared; however, renal function did not recover and the patient commenced regular haemodialysis. Four months later the patient received a cadaver kidney transplant. At transplantation and during follow-up there was neither clinical nor laboratory evidence of lupus activity, but 19 months after transplantation, when steroids were tapered to a low dose, the lupus anticoagulant factor was detected, and renal-vein thrombosis complicated by sepsis led to the patient's death. A membranous glomerulonephritis was found on autopsy. This is the first time in which a (probably 'de novo') membranous glomerulonephritis has been detected in the allograft of a patient with circulating lupus anticoagulant factor."
5520350	"Regulatory Foxp3-expressing T cells (Tregs), IL-10-producing B cells (Bregs), and IDO-expressing dendritic cells (DCregs) downregulate inflammatory processes and induces peripheral tolerance. These subpopulations also might participate in maintaining allograft immunological quiescence in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) with an excellent long-term graft function under immunosuppression (ELTGF). The aim of the study was to characterize and to enumerate peripheral Tregs, Bregs, and DCregs in KTR with an ELTGF for more than 5 years after transplant. Fourteen KTR with an ELTGF, 9 KTR with chronic graft dysfunction (CGD), and 12 healthy donors (HDs) were included in the study. CD19(+)-expressing peripheral B lymphocytes were purified by positive selection. IL-10-producing B cells, CD4(+)/CD25(hi), and CD8(+)/CD28(-) Tregs, as well as CCR6(+)/CD123(+)/IDO(+) DCs, were quantitated by flow cytometry. IL-10-producing Bregs (immature/transitional, but not CD19(+)/CD38(hi)/CD24(hi)/CD27(+)B10 cells), CCR6(+)/CD123(+)/IDO(+) DCs, and Tregs from ELTGF patients had similar or higher percentages versus HD (P <    0.05). By contrast, number of Tregs, DCregs, and Bregs except for CD27(+)B10 cells from CGD patients had lower levels versus HD and ELTGF patients (P <    0.05). The findings of this exploratory study might suggest that in ELTGF patients, peripheral tolerance mechanisms could be directly involved in the maintenance of a quiescent immunologic state and graft function stability."
4273082	"The interaction and conformational relationships between rRNAs and ribosomal proteins are responsible for ribosome activity. We tested seven different deoxyoligonucleotides complementary to the selected, highly conserved sequences of 18S rRNAs important in protein biosynthesis. We carried out a reaction of binding Phe-tRNA to A site on the ribosomes converted either to pre- or to post-translocational states (with or without pre-hybridized oligonucleotides). We found a correlation between the level of oligomer hybridization and the inhibition of AA-tRNA binding. We observed well-defined structural changes of ribosome's conformation during different steps of the elongation cycle of protein biosynthesis."
2520239	"We recently reported that the pathogenesis of pemphigus vulgaris (PV), an autoimmune blistering skin disorder, is driven by the accumulation of c-Myc secondary to abrogation of plakoglobin (PG)-mediated transcriptional c-Myc suppression. PG knock-out mouse keratinocytes express high levels of c-Myc and resemble PVIgG-treated wild-type keratinocytes in most respects. However, they fail to accumulate nuclear c-Myc and loose intercellular adhesion in response to PVIgG-treatment like wild-type keratinocytes. This suggested that PG is also required for propagation of the PVIgG-induced events between augmented c-Myc expression and acantholysis. Here, we addressed this possibility by comparing PVIgG-induced changes in the desmosomal organization between wild-type and PG knock-out keratinocytes. We found that either bivalent PVIgG or monovalent PV-Fab (known to trigger blister formation in vivo) disrupt the linear organization of all major desmosomal components along cell borders in wild-type keratinocytes, simultaneously with a reduction in intercellular adhesive strength. In contrast, PV-Fab failed to affect PG knock-out keratinocytes while PVIgG cross-linked their desmosomal cadherins without significantly affecting desmoplakin. These results identify PG as a principle effector of the PVIgG-induced signals downstream of c-Myc that disrupt the desmosomal plaque at the plasma membrane."
2994261	"When injected into human skin, endothelin-1 produces intense vasoconstriction localized to the site of the injection, but this area of vasoconstriction is surrounded by vasodilatation which spreads several centimetres from the injection site. The vasodilatation induced by intradermal injection of endothelin-1 (63 pmol) into human skin is prevented by local anaesthetic. Pretreatment of human skin with capsaicin also inhibits this response. Pretreatment of subjects with the selective histamine H1-receptor antagonist cetirizine, 10 mg orally 4 h before intradermal injections, inhibited vasodilatation caused by the intradermal injection of histamine (750 pmol), endothelin-1 (63 pmol), and carbachol (750 pmol). Endothelin-1 (0.3-10 microM) and carbachol (1-30 microM) failed to induce histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells. We conclude that the vasodilatation caused by intradermal injection of endothelin-1 into human skin is neurogenic and is probably mediated by neuropeptide-containing primary afferent neurones. Because neither carbachol nor endothelin-1 cause histamine release from mast cells, our data suggest that histamine release from mast cells at the effector end of the axon reflex is responsible for the carbachol- and endothelin-induced vasodilatation in human skin."
9744281	"Human epidermal surface lipids were collected by an ethanol wash and the ceramides were quantified by thin-layer chromatography-photodensitometry. Six ceramide fractions were isolated and the structural components of each were analyzed in detail. The most unusual of the epidermal ceramides contained a sphingosine base with amide-linked 30- and 32-carbon omega-hydroxyacids and an ester-linked nonhydroxyacid, 41% of which was linoleic acid. The proportion of linoleic acid in the analogous ceramide from comedones was 6%. This supports the hypothesis that a localized insufficiency of linoleic acid in the follicular epithelium is an etiologic factor in comedogenesis."
1573244	"In a consecutive series of 60 right lobe adult-to-adult live donor liver transplantations (ALDLTs), safety and efficacy of the University of Wisconsin (UW) and histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) solution were evaluated. The first 30 liver grafts were perfused with UW solution and the subsequent 30 by HTK solution. Donor and recipient characteristics of both groups were comparable. All liver graft implantations were performed with cross-clamping of the inferior vena cava (IVC) and without veno-venous bypass. Main outcome measures were posttransplantation liver biochemistry, prothrombin time, and recipient morbidity, as well as graft and recipient survival. There were no significant differences of the outcome measures between the 2 groups. The low potassium content of the HTK solution nonetheless offered logistic advantages. In 25 of the 30 recipients of the HTK group, portal vein anastomosis was performed with a clamp on the donor portal vein while the clamps on the IVC were already released. This shortened the period during which the IVC was being cross-clamped. HTK solution was as safe and effective as a cold storage solution as UW solution in ALDLT. Its low potassium content has advantage of earlier restoration of patency of the IVC and thus hemodynamic stability. The cost of using HTK solution was also lower."
8306895	"Acne vulgaris is a common skin disease in which abnormal desquamation, excess sebum production, proliferation of Propionibacterium acnes, and production of proinflammatory mediators all contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. A review of the literature shows that our current understanding of acne pathogenesis continues to evolve. Recent data suggests that inflammatory mediators may play a more important role than previously realized; however, how these mediators work independently as well as together in acne lesion progression is not well understood. Several cell types and mediators involved in the pathology of acne are responsible for producing or exacerbating an inflammatory response. Here, we present an updated theoretical model of acne lesion progression that highlights the role inflammatory mediators may play throughout acne lesion development."

A monoclonal population of T cells was found in blood samples from 13 (34%) of 38 consecutive patients with a definite diagnosis of systemic sclerosis who were prospectively examined by T-cell receptor gamma gene rearrangement using polymerase chain reaction analysis and denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis. In the healthy control group, the same type of examination revealed a monoclonal population of T cells in the blood samples from only 3 healthy subjects (4%)(odds ratio, 12.28; 95% confidence interval, 2.76-54.64; P = .001). Patients who had a circulating clonal population of T cells were older than those who did not (67 years vs 48 years; P = .04). There was a marked relationship between systemic sclerosis subtypes and the presence of a circulating clonal population of T cells. Twelve (43%) of 28 patients with limited cutaneous sclerosis exhibited a circulating clonal population of T cells, whereas only 1 (10%) of the 10 patients with diffuse cutanous sclerosis had evidence of T-cell clonality (P<   .01).                                                                                      Clonally expanded T cells were more commonly detected in patients with limited cutaneous sclerosis than in those with diffuse cutaneous sclerosis, which is also in accordance with a possible role of clonal T cells in patients with limited cutaneous sclerosis."

Therefore, rapid and accurate diagnosis is necessary for appropriate patient management. We report a patient with renal transplant who developed recurrent cutaneous alternariosis. Tzanck smear successfully and very rapidly revealed hyphae and spores in both the primary and subsequent lesions. Furthermore, Tzanck smear provided guidance for histopathological examination of the second lesion, which failed to disclose the fungal elements until additional deeper serial sections were performed. The present case emphasizes that the Tzanck smear is a useful clinical tool leading to the immediate correct diagnosis even in deep fungal infections."
5334933	"Successful stem cell mobilization and collection is possible in B-CLL after a favorable response to preceding chemotherapy, and also after treatment with the new nucleoside analogues fludarabine and cladribine. A poor response, on the other hand, seemed to predict a mobilization failure. CD34+ cell selection resulted in a 2- to 3-log reduction of the CLL cells in the harvests. Engraftment with both unselected and selected progenitor cells was rapid, and need for hospitalization was short. High-dose therapy with stem cell rescue appears to be capable of inducing CRs of high quality, but so far the follow-up is too short to define whether this will be translated into prolonged disease-free survival."
3610533	"Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was evaluated by measuring superoxide scavenging capability with the aid of an electron spin resonance (ESR) spin trapping method in a swine orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) model. The animals were divided into two groups, depending on the length of the survival periods: the short survival group (n = 8) survived less than 6 days and the long survival group (n = 15) 6 days or longer. SOD activity was significantly lower in the short survival group than in the long survival group after reperfusion (P <    0.01). During the period of cold preservation, a minimal change in SOD activity was noted, regardless of the length of preservation. Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels after reperfusion and serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels 1 h after reperfusion were significantly higher in the short survival group than in the long survival group (P <    0.01 and P <    0.05, respectively). The difference in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) was significantly greater in the short survival group at 1 h after reperfusion (P <    0.01). The authors conclude that superoxide scavenging activities in the graft reflect the magnitude of reperfusion injury, which can be a reliable parameter for the estimation of graft outcome."
8566592	"This study investigated the recovery of pancreatic insulin content during human islet isolation prior to and after digestion-filtration, continuous Hanks-Ficoll gradient purification (n = 20), and 3-4 day culture at 22 degrees C (n = 6). The native insulin content varied in a wide range from 28.4 U to 360.8 U/pancreas. After digestion the initially measured average insulin content of 115.8 +/- 20.8 U/pancreas (mean +/- SEM) increased to 264.6 +/- 22.8% (p <    0.001). This increase of insulin during pancreas digestion was attributed to the asymetrical distribution of insulin within the pancreas. Sampling of insulin within the pancreatic caput seemed not to be representative for the insulin content of the complete native organ, because the ratio of insulin per gram tissue within the pancreatic cauda compared to the caput (n = 5) was 2.4 +/- 0.4 (p <    0.05). After purification total insulin recovery was 55.3 +/- 4.8% (p <    0.001). Because recovery of islet equivalent number (IEQ) (83.7 +/- 4.4%) exceeded insulin recovery, insulin/IEQ ratio decreased from 656.8 +/- 70.6 microU/IEQ before purification to 436.4 +/- 58.1 microU/IEQ (p <    0.001) after purification. After 22 degrees C culture (n = 6) recovery of insulin and IEQ was 80.1 +/- 8.1% (p <    0.05) and 92.8 +/- 3.5% (p = NS), respectively. Insulin content per IEQ decreased to 85.8 +/- 6.5% (p <    0.05). This study clearly shows that most of islet insulin is lost during purification. This seems to be caused rather by an amplified insulin release than by the loss of islets itself. This release may facilitate the separation of endocrine and exocrine tissue by gradient centrifugation, but may also accelerate islet exhaustion detrimental for long-term insulin independence."
2444340	"We previously showed an association between donor leukocyte relative telomere length (RTL) and post-hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) survival in patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) who received bone marrow grafts at ages <   40 years. Here, we tested the generalizability of the prior findings in an independent validation cohort and by recipient age and stem cell source in the combined discovery and validation cohorts. We used monoplex quantitative real-time PCR to measure RTL in: (1) a new SAA validation cohort of 428 patients (age range, .2 to 77 years) with available pretransplantation donor blood samples in the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research repository, and (2) 278 patients from the original cohort who had sufficient DNA to repeat RTL testing. We used Cox proportional hazard models to calculate hazard ratios (HRs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) across categories of donor RTL. Data from the validation cohort showed no association between donor RTL and patient survival, but further analysis identified differences by recipient age and stem cell source as the likely explanation. In patients <   40 years, the HR comparing longest with shortest and middle RTL tertiles = .75; 95% CI,  .44 to 1.30 versus HR = 1.05; 95% CI, .59 to 1.89 for patients ≥40 years, P interaction = .37. In bone marrow recipients, the HR = .68; 95% CI, .72 to 1.10 versus HR = 1.29; 95% CI, .64 to 2.62 for peripheral blood stem cell grafts; P interaction = .88. Analyses using data from the 2 cohorts showed a statistically significant survival benefit only in <   40-year-old patients receiving bone marrow graft (HR comparing longest and middle RTL tertiles with shortest = .69; 95% CI, .50 to .95, P = .02). The study suggested that the association between donor RTL and post-HCT outcomes in recipients with SAA may vary by recipient age and stem cell source. A larger study is needed to account for multiple comparisons and to further test the generalizability of our findings."
8109625	"Psoriasis is a disease with considerable heterogeneity in clinical presentation. This is the first study using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to compare global protein expression patterns in lesional and non-lesional skin from subjects with acute guttate psoriasis associated with streptococcal throat infection and chronic plaque psoriasis. Samples from experimentally induced contact eczema and normal skin from healthy controls were also included. Proteins with statistically significant differences in expression were used in hierarchical cluster analyses resulting in separation of the different samples into groups. Chronic plaque and guttate psoriasis samples were distinctly separated, indicating that they represent discrete phenotypes at the protein expression level. Interestingly, there was a trend in which guttate psoriasis lesions clustered closer to eczema than to chronic plaque psoriasis lesions, indicating that the duration of the inflammatory reaction may affect clustering. Several of the differentially expressed proteins were identified by mass spectrometry."
9606799	"A major catabolic pathway for gibberellin (GA) is initiated by 2beta-hydroxylation, a reaction catalyzed by GA 2-oxidase. We have isolated and characterized a cDNA, designated Oryza sativa GA 2-oxidase 1 (OsGA2ox1) from rice (Oryza sativa L. cv Nipponbare) that encodes a GA 2-oxidase. The encoded protein, produced by heterologous expression in Escherichia coli, converted GA(1), GA(4), GA(9), GA(20), and GA(44) to the corresponding 2beta-hydroxylated products GA(8), GA(34), GA(51), GA(29), and GA(98), respectively. Ectopic expression of the OsGA2ox1 cDNA in transgenic rice inhibited stem elongation and the development of reproductive organs. These transgenic plants were deficient in endogenous GA(1). These results indicate that OsGA2ox1 encodes a GA 2-oxidase, which is functional not only in vitro but also in vivo. OsGA2ox1 was expressed in shoot apex and roots but not in leaves and stems. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that OsGA2ox1 mRNA was localized in a ring at the basal region of leaf primordia and young leaves. This ring-shaped expression around the shoot apex was drastically decreased after the phase transition from vegetative to reproductive growth. It was absent in the floral meristem, but it was still present in the lateral meristem that remained in the vegetative phase. These observations suggest that OsGA2ox1 controls the level of bioactive GAs in the shoot apical meristem; therefore, reduction in its expression may contribute to the early development of the inflorescence meristem."
3821749	"Neural transplantation of GABA-producing cells into key structures within seizure-suppressing circuits holds promise for medication-resistant epilepsy patients not eligible for resection of the epileptic focus. The substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), a basal ganglia output structure, is well known to modulate different seizure types. A recent microinjection study by our group indicated that the subthalamic nucleus (STN), which critically regulates nigral activity, might be a more promising target for focal therapy in epilepsies than the SNr. As a proof of principle, we therefore assessed the anticonvulsant efficacy of bilateral and unilateral allografting of GABA-producing cell lines into the STN using the timed intravenous pentylenetetrazole seizure threshold test, which allows repeated seizure threshold determinations in individual rats. We observed (a) that grafted cells survived up to the end of the experiments, (b) that anticonvulsant effects can be induced by bilateral transplantation into the STN using immortalized GABAergic cells derived from the rat embryonic striatum and cells additionally transfected to obtain higher GABA synthesis than the parent cell line, and (c) that anticonvulsant effects were observed even after unilateral transplantation into the STN. Neither grafting of control cells nor transplantation outside the STN induced anticonvulsant effects, emphasizing the site and cell specificity of the observed anticonvulsant effects. To our knowledge, the present study is the first showing anticonvulsant effects by grafting of GABA-producing cells into the STN. The STN can be considered a highly promising target region for modulation of seizure circuits and, moreover, has the advantage of being clinically established for functional neurosurgery."
4516688	"Telaprevir, combined with pegylated interferon alfa and ribavirin, is an efficacious approach to treat hepatitis C virus infection. A morbilliform eruption associated with telaprevir is a common adverse effect experienced by patients. Current guidelines mandate telaprevir discontinuation in any patient with a severe, progressive, or unresponsive cutaneous eruption.                                                                                   Eight patients with a grade 3 (severe) widespread morbilliform eruption associated with telaprevir were referred to dermatology for evaluation and treatment. Each patient received a combination of antihistamines, topical corticosteroids, and thick emollient creams, rendering their eruption tolerable for the duration of treatment. No patients had evidence of a systemic or life-threatening drug reaction, developed a systemic drug eruption, or had to prematurely stop triple therapy secondary to a cutaneous eruption.                                                                                                    Patients with an uncomplicated grade 3 (severe) widespread morbilliform eruption associated with telaprevir may be able to continue triple therapy with close monitoring and dermatologic consultation. Given our findings, we propose an additional clinical classification of the telaprevir-associated eruption to better reflect the dermatologic classification of drug eruptions."
7901566	"The biosynthesis of cucurbitacins during the seed germination of Bryonia dioica was studied by analysis of the cucurbitacin-triterpenoid fraction and by tracer experiments with acetate-[2- (14)C]. Isolation of 10alpha-cucurbita-5,24-dien-3beta-ol (9a), the simplest tetracyclic triterpene with a cucurbitane skeleton, supports the view that (9a) is the general precursor of cucurbitacins. Moreover, following the tracer experiments, cucurbitacin E (1a) was the first cucurbitacin formed, whereas the less oxygenated bryodulcosigenin (4a) was not detectable during germination of the plant. In the course of the present investigation, a new pentacyclic triterpene, isomultiflorenol (11a) (possible precursor of bryonolic acid (5a)), was also isolated."

This study was performed to investigate the impact of vaseline on the ultraviolet (UV) transmission of non-irradiated split skin and on split skin previously exposed to UVB radiation.                                                                              Split-skin specimens were obtained from 20 patients. In each case, one sample was taken from an area of non-irradiated skin, while the second was taken from an area that had been previously exposed to UVB. The transmission was spectrophotometrically measured with split skin placed in specially designed quartz glass cuvettes before and after the application of two different amounts of vaseline (2.5 and 17.5 mg cm-2).                                                                              Application of vaseline to skin previously exposed to UVB caused significant (P <    0.0001) changes in UV transmission in certain wavelength ranges. In the UVA range, a greater increase in transmission was achieved with 2.5 mg cm-2 vaseline, whereas in the UVB range, a greater increase was achieved with 17.5 mg cm-2 vaseline. The thicker the layer of vaseline applied, the lower was the difference in transmission between non-irradiated split skin and UVB-exposed split skin.                                                                                      Application of the correct amount of vaseline can enhance transmission in either the UVA or UVB range, and would enable dose reduction during a course of phototherapy."

To assess the impact of a telephone support program for heart transplant patients during the first year after transplantation.                                                                                           We analyzed 30 consecutive heart transplant patients at our institution, who were randomized to either a standard care group or a group with the additional possibility of direct telephone contact with a cardiologist. We analyzed the time employed answering the calls, the reasons for consultation, and the number of hospital trips avoided.                                                                              Among the total sample, 15 patients were assigned to the intervention program. Over 194 +/- 103 days, we received 28 calls. The mean call duration was 10.2 +/- 3.9 minutes, with 39.3% of the consultations concerning medication dosages 28.6% lifestyle issues, 25% infectious symptoms, and the remaining 7%, medication side effects. Medication readjustments were made in 33% of the calls; 10.7% of the calls, all for infectious symptoms, required direct medical consultation.

The purpose of this trial was to investigate the safety and efficacy of the VA in elderly patients with end-stage heart failure.                                                                              In this prospective trial, patients requiring circulatory support either as destination therapy (DT) or as a bridge to transplant (BTT) were implanted with a VA device.                                                                              Between June 2003 and August 2006, 9 elderly patients (mean age 65 years) were implanted. The median support time was 454 (range 73 to 977) days for the DT and 35 (range 26 to 508) days for the BTT cohort. All patients survived implantation; 30-day mortality was 22% (n = 2). The adverse event profile was encouraging, with no embolic neurologic events and minimal sepsis. Cumulative trial support time was 7.3 patient-years.

5247887	"We have isolated by differential hybridization a cDNA, termed Emb564, which is complementary to an 800 nt embryo-specific transcript in Zea mays. The expression of Emb564 can be enhanced by exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) and the effect of ABA on the accumulation of Emb564 transcript appears to be confined to embryos at the early and mid embryonic stages. In addition, Emb564 is expressed at low levels in ABA-deficient but not in ABA non-responsive embryos. Genomic analysis suggested that the Emb564 mRNA is encoded by a single gene. Sequence analysis showed that Emb564 exhibits extensive similarities with several known ABA-inducible genes."

To understand the mechanisms of action is important for the choice of treatments. AD-like lesions can be induced experimentally in NC/Nga mice.

PUVA therapy was performed with intraperitoneal injection of 4 mg/kg of 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) and 4 J/cm(2)-UVA irradiation before and after development of AD-like lesions in NC/Nga mice which had been maintained in a conventional room (Conv-NC/Nga mice). Clinical skin conditions were evaluated periodically by a clinical severity score defined. Lesions were histologically examined in haematoxylin-eosin or toluidine blue-stained sections. Plasma levels of total IgE were measured at various time points.                                                                              In Conv-NC/Nga mice infested with mite, AD-like lesions started to develop at 8 week of age and thereafter increased in severity score. PUVA therapy at lower does than minimal phototoxic dose suppressed the development of dermatitis and was also therapeutically effective against established lesions. Proliferation of dermal mast cells in AD-like lesions was suppressed, but IgE hyperproduction was not changed after PUVA.

Both the follicular casts and the residual skin surface strip, the last representing a mixture of stratum corneum and surface lipids, were extracted twice with n-hexane-ethanol under ultrasonication, evaporated, redissolved in chloroform-methanol and separated by high-performance thin layer chromatography, using cholesterol sulphate, cerebroside, ceramide types 3 and 4, cholesterol, oleic acid, triolein, cholesterol oleate and squalene as standards. Identification was performed by computer-assisted densitometric analysis. Six patient groups receiving adapalene 0.1%, tretinoin 0.025%, clindamycin 1%, clindamycin 1% + tretinoin 0.025%, benzoyl peroxide 5% or benzoyl peroxide 5% + erythromycin 2% were investigated before and 12 weeks after application.                                                                              A significant decrease in free fatty acid proportions combined with an increase in triglycerides was observed in the groups receiving antimicrobial therapy, supporting the hypothesis of lipolysis due to microbial colonization. The groups treated with topical retinoids showed an additional significant increase in ceramide subfractions, most probably reflecting their influence on epidermal keratinization.                                                                                      Our method proved suitable for the detection of quantitative and qualitative changes in lipid profiles of both infundibulum cast content and surface lipids.

We report here a case of multiple FDE induced by atenolol in a 48-year-old woman confirmed by positive patch test in previously affected sites. Beta-blockers-induced FDE are very rare. Only two cases had been reported in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case reported of atenolol-induced FDE confirmed by a positive patch test."
4451292	"We analyzed the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters in a 3D cellular arrangement in vivo by using a modified Nipkow disk-type confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM). We first defined the 3D values of Phi(PSII) (photochemical yield of PSII) and NPQ (non-photochemical quenching) in mesophyll, epidermal and guard cell chloroplasts from the leaf surface to several tens of microns in depth. We also used this CLSM method to analyze the relationships between actinic light intensity and the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters for Boston fern and broad bean leaf specimens. As the actinic light intensity increased, the mean Phi(PSII) values decreased and the NPQ values increased in all chloroplasts of Boston fern and broad bean leaf. These values differed with cell type and species. The Boston fern chloroplasts had lower Phi(PSII) values than the broad bean chloroplasts, and vice versa for the NPQ values. The Phi(PSII) values of Boston fern chloroplasts decreased in the order mesophyll, epidermal and guard cell chloroplasts. The NPQ values decreased in the order guard cell, mesophyll and epidermal chloroplasts, except at 12 micromol m(-2) s(-1) actinic light, when the mesophyll value was slightly lower than that of the epidermis. The trend in the Phi(PSII) and NPQ values of broad bean mesophyll and guard cell chloroplasts was opposite to that of Boston fern chloroplasts. As 3D CLSM can provide the Phi(PSII) and NPQ values of each chloroplast in a 3D cellular arrangement, this method has potential for investigating differences in the functions of chloroplasts in vivo."
6972067	"Hyperhidrosis has recently been described as a novel adverse effect of laser-assisted hair removal in the axillary area. Inguinal Hyperhidrosis (IH) is a localized and, typically, a primary form of hyperhidrosis affecting the groin area in individuals before age 25. IH has been reported in the literature after traumas and as a dysfunction of the central sympathetic nervous system. To the best of our knowledge, IH has never been reported as secondary to laser-assisted hair removal. Herein, we report three cases of IH following depilatory laser of the inguinal zone. Three female patients with no relevant medical history presented with the complaint of excessive sweating in the inguinal area after undergoing full bikini depilatory laser sessions. Although never described before, depilatory laser seems to trigger the occurrence of hyperhidrosis in the inguinal zone."
7741241	"Seronegative hepatitis is a common cause of acute liver failure (ALF) requiring liver transplantation. The primary aim of this study was to examine outcomes following transplantation in this group and to identify factors associated with early (<   2 months) mortality. Patients studied were 110 consecutive cases of seronegative ALF transplanted at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, between January 1992 and January 2004. Univariate analysis of 44 pretransplantation recipient, donor, and operative variables was performed initially to identify factors associated with early posttransplantation mortality. Variables identified as significant or approaching significance were analyzed using stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis. Survival following transplantation for seronegative hepatitis was 83%, 81%, and 73% at 2, 12, and 60 months, respectively. The majority (71%) of deaths occurred within the 1st 2 months and sepsis / multiorgan dysfunction was the most common cause of early death. Univariate analysis revealed 9 variables predicting early death. Subsequent multivariate analysis identified high donor body mass index (BMI; a possible surrogate marker for hepatic steatosis) as the most important predictor of early death (P = .009; odds ratio, 1.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-1.3). Recipient age >   50 (P = .015; odds ratio, 4.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-14.1) and non-Caucasian recipient ethnicity (P = .015; odds ratio, 4.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-19.2) were other variables associated with early death on multivariate analysis. This study specifically examined factors that determine the early outcome of transplanted seronegative ALF patients. In conclusion, we found that donor and recipient factors identify patients who have a high chance of early death after transplantation."
6321128	"Plant respiration responses to elevated growth [CO(2)] are key uncertainties in predicting future crop and ecosystem function. In particular, the effects of elevated growth [CO(2)] on respiration over leaf development are poorly understood. This study tested the prediction that, due to greater whole plant photoassimilate availability and growth, elevated [CO(2)] induces transcriptional reprogramming and a stimulation of nighttime respiration in leaf primordia, expanding leaves and mature leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana. In primordia, elevated [CO(2)] altered transcript abundance, but not for genes encoding respiratory proteins. In expanding leaves, elevated [CO(2)] induced greater glucose content and transcript abundance for some respiratory genes, but did not alter respiratory CO(2) efflux. In mature leaves, elevated [CO(2)] led to greater glucose, sucrose and starch content, plus greater transcript abundance for many components of the respiratory pathway, and greater respiratory CO(2) efflux. Therefore, growth at elevated [CO(2)] stimulated dark respiration only after leaves transitioned from carbon sinks into carbon sources. This coincided with greater photoassimilate production by mature leaves under elevated [CO(2)] and peak respiratory transcriptional responses. It remains to be determined if biochemical and transcriptional responses to elevated [CO(2)] in primordial and expanding leaves are essential prerequisites for subsequent alterations of respiratory metabolism in mature leaves."
1568540	"Incubation of oat coleoptile segments with 40 µm indoleacetic acid (IAA) induced a decrease of 35-60% in peroxidase activity at the cell wall compartment. Treatment with IAA also produced a similar decrease in the oxidation of NADH and IAA at the cell wall. Isoelectric focusing of ionic, covalent, and intercellular wall peroxidase fractions showed that acidic isoforms (pI 4.0-5.5) were reduced preferentially by IAA treatment. Marked differences were found between acidic and basic wall isoperoxidases in relation to their efficacy in the oxidation of IAA. A peroxidase fraction containing acidic isoforms oxidized IAA with a V(max)/s(0.5) value of 2.4 x 10(-2) min(-1). g fw(-1), 4.0 times higher than that obtained for basic peroxidase isoforms (0.6 x 10(-2) min(-1). g fw(-1)). In contrast, basic isoforms were more efficient than acidic isoperoxidases in the oxidation of coniferyl alcohol or ferulic acid with H(2)O(2) (5.6 and 2.1 times, respectively). The levels of diferulate and lignin in the walls of oat coleoptile segments were not altered by treatment with IAA. The decrease in cell wall peroxidase activity by IAA was related more to reduced oxidative degradation of the hormone than to covalent cell wall cross-linking.Key Words.

4460919	"Plant responses to ozone (O3 ) and water deficit (WD) are commonly observed, although less is known about their interaction. Stomatal conductance (gs ) is both an impact of these stressors and a protective response to them. Stomatal closure reduces inward flux of O3 and outward flux of water. Stomatal measurements are generally obtained at midday when gas exchange is maximal, but these may not be adequate surrogates for stomatal responses observed at other times of day, nor for non-stomatal responses. Here, we find in Pima cotton that stomatal responses to O3 observed at midday do not reflect responses at other times. Stomata were more responsive to O3 and WD near midday, despite being at quasi-steady state, than during periods of active opening or closing in morning or evening. Stomatal responsivity to O3 was not coincident with maximum gas exchange or with periods of active regulation, but coincident with plant sensitivity to O3 previously determined in this cultivar. Responses of pigmentation and shoot productivity were more closely related to stomatal responses at midday than to responses at other times of day under well-watered (WW) conditions, reflecting higher stomatal responsivity, sensitivity to O3 , and magnitude of midday gs . Under WD conditions, shoot responses were more closely related to early morning gs. Root responses were more closely related to early morning gs under both WW and WD. Responses of stomata to O3 at midday were not good surrogates for stomatal responses early or late in the day, and may not adequately predicting O3 flux under WD or when maximum ambient concentrations do not occur near midday."

Recognition of the special characteristics of vulvar epithelium facilitates diagnosis of both sexually transmitted diseases and vulvar dermatoses that may be mistaken for STDs. The first section will review examination techniques and anatomic considerations. The second section will describe distinctive manifestations of vulvar herpes, human papillomavirus (HPV), molluscum contagiosum, scabies, and syphilis. The final section will provide differential diagnoses for primary and secondary vulvar lesions including erythema, papules, plaques, pustules, bullae, erosions, and ulcers."
6673388	"The alternative oxidase (Aox) was studied at different levels (transcript, protein and capacity) in response to an osmotic shock applied to roots of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata). Two cultivars of V. unguiculata were used, Vita 3 and Vita 5, tolerant and sensitive to drought/saline stress respectively. The seedlings (17-day-old) were grown in hydroponic conditions and submitted to NaCl (100 and 200 mM) or 200.67 g L(-1) PEG 6000 (iso-osmotic condition to 100 mM NaCl). The VuAox1 and VuAox2a mRNA were not detected in either cultivar under all tested conditions while the VuAox2b gene was differently expressed. In the tolerant cultivar (Vita 3), the expression of VuAox2b gene was stimulated by an osmotic stress induced by PEG which was associated with a higher amount and capacity of the Aox protein. In the same cultivar, this gene was under-expressed in salt stress conditions with poor effect on the protein level. In the sensitive cultivar (Vita 5), the transcript level of the VuAox2b was unchanged in response to PEG treatment, even though the protein and the capacity tended to increase. Upon salt stress, the VuAox2b gene was over-expressed. At 100mM NaCl, this VuAox2b gene over-expression led to a higher amount and capacity of Aox. This effect was reduced at 200 mM NaCl. Overall, these results suggest complex mechanisms (transcriptional, translational and post-translational) for Aox regulation in response to osmotic stress."
8552546	"Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) Bright Yellow-2 (BY-2) cells are rapidly proliferating meristematic cells that require auxin for culture in vitro. We have established several transgenic BY-2 cell lines that carry the T-DNA of Agrobacterium rhizogenes 15834, which harbors an agropine-type root-inducing (Ri) plasmid. Two of these lines, BYHR-3 and BYHR-7, were used to test the role of auxin in the proliferation of plant cells. The lines grew rapidly in Linsmaier-Skoog (LS) medium lacking auxin and other phytohormones. The TR-DNA, containing the aux1 (tryptophan monooxygenase) and aux2 (indoleacetamide hydrolase) genes, was present in the genomes of both transgenic lines, whereas the TL-DNA, containing the rolA, B, C and D genes, was present in the genome of BYHR-7 but not BYHR-3. Since the introduction of the rolABCD genes alone did not affect the auxin requirement of BY-2 cells, the aux1 and aux2 genes, but not the rolABCD genes, appear to be relevant to the auxin autotrophy of these transgenic lines. Furthermore, the overexpression of aux1 allowed BY-2 cells to grow rapidly in the absence of auxin, suggesting the existence in plant cells of an unidentified gene whose product is functionally equivalent or similar to that of aux2 of the Ri plasmid."

Four regions (head, dorsal neck, sacral and abdominal regions) were examined with both a contact hand-held nonpolarized light dermoscope at 10-fold magnification and a videodermoscope at 70-fold magnification. Findings were assessed using histological analysis of skin samples cut both longitudinally and transversely, set as the gold standard.                                                                              With a hand-held dermoscope at 10-fold magnification, thick, straight primary hairs surrounded by multiple secondary hairs were observed. With a videodermoscope at 70-fold magnification, hair shaft thickness was measured and the follicular openings and arrangement of vessels were clearly observed. Correspondence was observed between dermoscopic and histological results.

3883369	"An 18-year-old West Indian male presented with severe sternal pain and an exacerbation of facial acne. Radiographs of the sternum revealed several lytic lesions which appeared as hot areas on successive technetium bone scans. Painful areas over the right iliac crest and left greater trochanter likewise appeared as transient hot areas on successive scans. Histology of affected bone revealed reactive changes only. High dose prednisolone provided rapid alleviation of pain, which recurred on reducing the dose to less than 10 mg daily. Auto-immune complex disease has been considered the most likely aetiological mechanism of systemic acne (acne fulminans), but lytic lesions of bone have never previously been reported in auto-immune disorders."

The patient's serum immunoprecipitated polypeptides that comigrated with those identified in serum from a representative patient with antiepiligrin cicatricial pemphigoid, and was reactive with the laminin beta3-subunit on immunoblotting. She presented not only with cutaneous, oral and ocular, but also with laryngeal and esophageal involvement. Because the supraglottic stenosis was severe, she had to undergo tracheostomy to maintain airway patency."
1899717	"ABO-incompatible intestinal transplantation has rarely been performed due to poor patient outcomes. Herein we present a case of successful ABO-incompatible intestinal transplantation with a 2-year follow-up. A 16-year-old female with a history of extensive bowel resection received an ABO-incompatible living donor bowel graft from her father (blood type AB graft into a type A recipient). Posttransplant immunosuppression consisted of an initial anti-CD20, plasmapheresis/intravenous immunoglobulin before transplantation, followed by an anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) induction and splenectomy, and maintenance with tacrolimus and prednisone. Her postoperative course was remarkable for a single episode of rejection on day 14 which responded promptly to treatment with methyprednisolone and ATG. Three months after transplantation, the patient developed an abdominal abscess requiring open surgical drainage. No viral infections were encountered. Posttransplant anti-B antibody titers and anti-B7 donor-specific antibody levels remained low. At a 2-year follow-up, the patient showed a progressive weight gain of 5.0 kg. This case illustrates that ABO-incompatible living-related bowel transplantation is immunologically feasible and is associated with good outcomes for the recipient. The management of blood type antibodies and the use of adequate immunosuppression in the early period of the procedure may be the keys to the success of future cases."
5481439	"Organ-specific gene expression contains rich information about in vivo biological processes. This kind of information, previously gathered through microarray profiling, has been proven fruitful to the understanding of specific mutants, regulatory events, signaling, and development. With the advent of the next-generation sequencing (NGS) of RNAs, more quantitative and detailed information of gene expressions than previously available can now be collected for each organ or organ developmental stages. The combination of an object-oriented experimental design and an efficient treatment of the high volume information generated through a NGS platform may offer a powerful tool for inferring previously intractable developmental processes.                                                                              We collected transcriptomic data over a Solexa/Illumina platform on samples of Ipomoea leaf, sepal, and petals (at three developmental stages), and presented a method for analyzing transcriptomic variations within and between organs. We demonstrated that in vivo signals of transcriptomes can be retrieved de novo through the NGS techniques, proper data handling, bioinformatic tools, and the current understanding of molecular networks. We found that numbers of transcribed genes from both nuclear and chloroplast genomes decreased by the same order of leaf → sepal →petal. Petal resembled leaf in cell division patterns and abundance level of commonly expressed organelle genes. Its chloroplast transcripts constituted a subset of those in leaf. Moreover, reconstructions of multiple metabolic networks for each organ enabled inferences of substance flow, providing transcript evidence for the path of sucrose in leaf to anthocyanin synthesis in petal.                                                                                     Our results attest that developmental transcriptomes are highly informative for exploring connections between morphological traits and the associated molecular networks. Significant hypotheses have been developed, including that the petal is a derived organ of leaf and that its color can be modified by fluctuations of substance flow within the associated metabolic networks among organs."
9629615	"Cutaneous lichen planus (CLP) is a chronic inflammatory and immune-mediated disease. Wnt5a is one of the most extensively studied Wnt proteins, and has important functions in stimulating inflammation, cell proliferation, cell fate determination and cell differentiation. Wnt5a expression in CLP has not been comprehensively studied to date.

Skin samples were obtained from patients with CLP and healthy controls (HCs). The WNT5A gene was detected by real-time quantitative PCR, and Wnt5a protein by immunohistochemical analysis and western blotting.                                                                              WNT5A mRNA was upregulated in CLP samples compared with the HC skin samples (P <    0.001). Wnt5a protein was overexpressed in all layers of the epidermis and dermis in CLP lesions compared with HC skin (all P <    0.001). These results were confirmed by western blotting.

7507558	"A study of 121 melanoma patients and 139 control subjects from the University of California, San Francisco clinics was conducted among whites to examine the relationship between number of melanocytic nevi and cutaneous melanoma. Nevi that measured 2 mm or more in diameter were counted over the body by a dermatologist and a dermatology fellow. The average number of nondysplastic melanocytic nevi that were 2 mm or greater in diameter was 97 for melanoma patients and 36 for control subjects (p less than 0.001). Relative risks were 1.6 (p = 0.43) for 11 to 25 nevi, 4.4 (p = 0.01) for 26 to 50 nevi, 5.4 (p = 0.008) for 51 to 100 nevi, and 9.8 (p = 0.001) for more than 100 nondysplastic melanocytic nevi. Relative risks were 3.8 (p = 0.001) for 1 to 5 dysplastic nevi and 6.3 (p = 0.003) for 6 or more of these lesions. Report of blistering sunburns or of a previous skin cancer and having red or blond hair at the age of 20 were also independently associated with an increased risk of cutaneous melanoma. If confirmed in larger studies, the results presented on number of nevi and melanoma risk suggest a readily identifiable melanoma-prone group that could be followed to detect early malignant melanoma."

To investigate the effect of photodynamic therapy (PDT) with topical 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) on urethral condylomata acuminata and to examine the histological changes in lesions of condylomata acuminata after ALA-PDT.                                                                              Patients with urethral condylomata (n = 164) were given topical ALA followed by intraurethral PDT through a cylindrical fibre. Patients included 11 individuals with 16 penile or vulval condylomatous lesions which were biopsied before or after treatment; the histological changes were then evaluated by light microscopy and electron microscopy.                                                                              The complete response rate was 95% and the recurrence rate was 5% after 6-24 months of follow-up. Light microscopy revealed keratinocytes in the middle and upper layers of the epidermis showing marked vacuolation and some necrocytosis 1 and 3 h after PDT. Necrosis in all layers of the epidermis was noted 5 h after PDT. Electron microscopy of keratinocytes revealed distinct ultrastructural abnormalities of mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum, and membrane damage. Apoptotic bodies were detected 3 h after PDT and a large number of keratinocytes exhibited necrosis 5 h after PDT.                                                                                      Results suggest that, compared with conventional therapies, topical ALA-PDT is a simple, effective, safe and well-tolerated treatment for urethral condylomata acuminata that is associated with a low recurrence rate. The mechanism might be the triggering of both apoptosis and necrosis by ALA-PDT in human papillomavirus-infected keratinocytes."
5586389	"Renal transplant recipients with de novo DSA (dDSA) experience higher rates of rejection and worse graft survival than dDSA-free recipients. This study presents a single-center review of dDSA monitoring in a large, multi-ethnic cohort of renal transplant recipients.                                                                              The authors performed a nested case-control study of adult kidney and kidney-pancreas recipients from July 2007 through July 2011. Cases were defined as dDSA-positive whereas controls were all DSA-negative transplant recipients. DSA were determined at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months posttransplant, and every 6 months thereafter.                                                                              Of 503 recipients in the analysis, 24% developed a dDSA, of whom 73% had dDSA against DQ antigen. Median time to dDSA was 6.1 months (range 0.2-44.6 months). After multivariate analysis, African American race, kidney-pancreas recipient, and increasing numbers of human leukocyte antigen mismatches were independent risk factors for dDSA. Recipients with dDSA were more likely to suffer an acute rejection (AR) (35% vs. 10%, P<   0.001), an antibody-mediated AR (16% vs. 0.3%, P<   0.001), an AR ascribed to noncompliance (8% vs. 2%, P=0.001), and a recurrent AR (6% vs. 1%, P=0.002) than dDSA-negative recipients. At a median follow-up of 31 months, the death-censored actuarial graft survival of dDSA recipients was worse than the DSA-free cohort (P=0.002). Yet, for AR-free recipients, there was no difference in graft survival between cohorts (P=0.66).                                                                                      Development of dDSA was associated with an increased incidence of graft loss, yet the detrimental effect of dDSA was limited in the intermediate term to recipients with AR."
7940737	"Two hundred patients received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from matched sibling donors (MSD) after myeloablative conditioning including fludarabine (Flu) and once-daily intravenous busulfan (Bu). Thymoglobulin (TG) was added to methotexate (MTX) and cyclosporine (CsA) as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. For low-risk (acute leukemia CR1/CR2, CML CP1) patients projected 5-year nonrelapse mortality (NRM) and overall survival (OS) were 4% and 76% for those <   or=45 years old (n = 54) and 6% and 83% for those >   45 (n = 31). For high-risk (HR) patients NRM was 6% versus 27% (18% at 1 year) (P = .04) and OS 64% versus 37% (P = .47) in younger (n = 40) and older (n = 75) patients, respectively. To correct for imbalance in HR diagnoses each of 17 younger HR patients were matched with 2 older HR (OHR) patients by diagnosis and details of stage, and thereafter for other risk factors. For the younger HR and OHR patients, respectively, OS was 70% versus 37% (P = .02) and NRM 0 versus 34% (P = .02). When outcomes of OHR patients were compared with the other 3 groups combined NRM was 27% versus 5%, respectively (P = .002). Incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) grade II-IV, aGVHD grade III-IV, and chronic GVHD (cGVHD) was 23% versus 10% (P = .02), 4% versus 2% (P = ns), and 66% versus 41% (P = .001), respectively. Nine of 14 nonrelapse deaths in the OHR group were related to GVHD or its treatment compared with 3 of 6 in all others (P value for GVHD related death = .01). Multivariate analysis of OS and DFS correcting for potentially confounding pretransplant factors identified only the OHR patients as having significantly increased risk (relative risk [RR] 3.32, confidence interval [CI] 1.71-6.47, P <    .0001, and RR 3.32, CI 1.71-6.43, P <    .0001, respectively). The effect of age on NRM is only apparent in HR patients, and is not explained by heterogeneity in diagnoses. Older HR patients experience more GVHD and more GVHD-related death than others, but NRM is no higher than reported with many nonmyeloablative regimens."
9468129	"Congenital melanocytic naevi, consisting of clusters of naevo-melanocytes, develop in utero. Although many congenital naevi are visible at birth, some may not become evident until later in life. The timing of naevo-melanocyte proliferation, senescence and melanogenesis may all contribute towards determining when a naevus will become clinically manifest on the skin. Besides the fact that congenital melanocytic naevi may be aesthetically displeasing, resulting in a multitude of psychosocial issues, they also increase the risk for developing cutaneous melanoma, leptomeningeal melanoma, neurocutaneous melanocytosis, malformations of the brain and, rarely, other tumours such as rhabdomyosarcoma and liposarcoma. Whereas the risk of developing malignancy in association with congenital naevi is dependent, to some extent, on the size of the naevus, the risk of developing neurocutaneous melanocytosis correlates best with the number of satellite naevi. Management of patients with congenital melanocytic naevi requires individualization, taking into account the naevus size and location, and the risk of developing cutaneous melanoma or neurocutaneous melanocytosis. When contemplating treatment options, it is important to set realistic expectations and to address the possible aesthetic and functional outcomes, while at the same time addressing the risk for developing cutaneous and/or extracutaneous melanoma."
6711000	"Protein contact dermatitis (PCD) is a chronic recurrent dermatitis caused by contact with a proteinaceous material. PCD may also present as paronychia. Here a case of PCD and paronychia from natural rubber latex (NRL) is presented. The correct diagnosis would not have been established if prick testing with NRL had not been performed. This case shows that contact allergy presenting as dermatitis may occur despite negative patch test results. PCD from NRL may be relatively common, although very few cases have been published. This is probably due to the fact that the term contact urticaria is so closely connected to NRL that automatically all cases of type I allergy to NRL are considered contact urticaria, although the clinical picture is a dermatitis, i.e. PCD."
2105221	"In immunocompromised patients, cooperative effects of human papillomavirus (HPV) and ultraviolet (UV) radiation have been postulated in the development of non-melanoma skin cancers. The tumor suppressor p53 is a key component of the cellular response to genotoxic agents, such as UV radiation. We have previously demonstrated that in HPV16-infected cells, a higher E6* level was associated with a higher resistance to UV and oxidative stress. Using the two same SKv cell lines, the aim of the present study was to investigate p53 and p21 expression and cell death in HPV-infected keratinocytes in response to UV irradiation and to determine the role of HPV oncoprotein levels on the p53-mediated cellular response. We demonstrated that the weakly E6*-expressing level SKv-e cell line presented both higher cytotoxicity and apoptosis to UV. This high sensitivity was associated with both p53 and p21 nuclear accumulation, while a high E6* level and resistance were associated with no p53 accumulation and a p21 nuclear down-regulation after UV. Moreover, in SKv-e cell line, p21 promoter activation was p53 dependent. Our results suggest that an alteration and/or a modulation of the p53-p21 pathway in response to UV could be determinant for HPV-infected keratinocyte survival and HPV-associated carcinogenic process."
6124374	"Lichenoid keratosis (LK) is a rather frequent skin lesion that has some histologic features similar to lichen planus (LP). The clinical and histopathologic characteristics of LK and differential tools from LP are not yet fully established.                                                                                  The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical and histopathologic characteristics of LK.                                                                              A clinical survey was done with 17 patients diagnosed as having LK. We reevaluated biopsy materials of 17 patients diagnosed during the past 10 years at Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea. We performed an immunohistochemical staining in 17 cases of LK and 7 cases of LP using 5 antibodies for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, and cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen (CLA). Standard streptavidin-biotin peroxidase method using the monoclonal antibodies with 3-amino-9-ethyl-carbazole was used.                                                                              The male/female ratio was 1:1.1. The mean age at diagnosis was 54.9 years. The face was the most commonly affected site, followed by the arm and forearm, dorsum of hand, chest, trunk, abdomen, and leg. The lesions were predominantly solitary (76.5%); 1 patient had 4 lesions; 3 patients (17.6%) had numerous lesions. The lesions ranged in size from 0.4 to 2.0 cm. Histopathologically, all the cases showed characteristic lichenoid infiltrates of lymphocytes, occasional parakeratosis, and apoptotic bodies in the epidermis without nuclear atypia of keratinocytes. LK could be reclassified into 3 patterns by means of histopathologic findings: LP-like (11/17), seborrheic keratosis-like (3/17), and lupus erythematosus-like (3/17). Immunohistochemical studies revealed that infiltrated epidermal and dermal lymphocytes in LK consisted mainly of CD8(+) T cells and partly CD20(+) B cells. In LP, epidermal lymphocytes were mainly CD8(+) T cells and dermal lymphocytes were CD4(+) or CD8(+) T cells. Interestingly, CLA was strongly expressed in LP but not expressed in LK.                                                                                     We reclassified LK as follows: LP-like LK, seborrheic keratosis-like LK, and lupus erythematosus-like LK. Immunohistochemical stains for CLA as well as CD4 and CD8 may be valuable tools in the differential diagnosis between LK and LP."

Group 1a (5 rats) were given daily intraperitoneal injections of 100 mg/kg of gentamicin and sacrificed on day 7. Group 1b (10 rats) were similarly treated but were sacrificed on day 14. Group 2a (5 rats) were given 30 mg/kg of phospholipids for 6 days and sacrificed on day 7, serving as phospholipid controls. Group 2b (5 rats) were similarly treated, and from day 7 onwards daily intraperitoneal injections of 100 mg/kg of gentamicin were given while oral phospholipids were continued until the rats were sacrificed 7 days after gentamicin treatment. Group 2c (10 rats) were treated in the same manner as group 2b but the animals were sacrificed on day 28 after gentamicin treatment. Group 3 (10 rats) were given 30 mg/kg of phospholipids concurrently with intraperitoneal gentamicin injections and were sacrificed on day 28. Protein concentrations, N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAG) activities and creatinine were measured in 24-h urine samples. Serum creatinine concentrations were measured in blood samples and 24-h creatinine clearance calculated. Gentamicin concentrations were determined in kidney tissues from which sections were also taken for light- and electron-microscopy. Results showed that gentamicin induced a marked increase in NAG and protein excretion, and a marked decrease in creatinine clearance with six rats succumbing to uraemia. Phospholipid treatment, whether started before or concurrently with gentamicin injections, reduced gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity. The rats did not lose weight. Urinary excretion of NAG and protein was significantly reduced.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
9508043	"This study was conducted to evaluate the risk factors of scabies introduction into a hospital. We addressed the following question: Do patients transferred from other institutions pose a higher risk than patients from the community? From July 2003 to May 2006, a trained physician surveyed the inpatients and staff of a psychiatric hospital (six wards, 300 beds) on a monthly basis. During the study period, specific infection control measures beyond standard precautions, such as prophylactic treatment, were not adopted. There were 333 newly-admitted patients during the study period and among them, 122 were transferred from other institutions. Seven patients were diagnosed with scabies. Two of these patients were infected while in the hospital (secondary infection), thus the number of introduced scabies cases (index cases) was five. Four of the index cases were transferred from other institutions (three from psychiatric hospitals and one from a nursing home). The source of infection for one index case was unexplained. The rate of scabies infection among transferred patients was 3.3% while the infection rate among patients from the community was 0.5%. Therefore, transferred patients pose a higher risk than those from the community. The average time from admission to diagnosis of scabies was 141 days (range 34-313 days). The hospital personnel checked the skin condition of all patients at admission and none of the four patients showed symptoms of scabies."
3833346	"Although fast-growing Populus species consume a large amount of water for biomass production, there are considerable variations in water use efficiency (WUE) across different poplar species. To compare differences in growth, WUE and anatomical properties of leaf and xylem and to examine the relationship between photosynthesis/WUE and anatomical properties of leaf and xylem, cuttings of six poplar species were grown in a botanical garden. The growth performance, photosynthesis, intrinsic WUE (WUE(i) ), stable carbon isotope composition (δ(13) C) and anatomical properties of leaf and xylem were analysed in these poplar plants. Significant differences were found in growth, photosynthesis, WUE(i)  and anatomical properties among the examined species. Populus cathayana was the clone with the fastest growth and the lowest WUE(i) /δ(13) C, whereas P. × euramericana had a considerable growth increment and the highest WUE(i) /δ(13) C. Among the analysed poplar species, the highest total stomatal density in P. cathayana was correlated with its highest stomatal conductance (g(s) ) and lowest WUE(i) /δ(13) C. Moreover, significant correlations were observed between WUE(i)  and abaxial stomatal density and stem vessel lumen area. These data suggest that photosynthesis, WUE(i)  and δ(13) C are associated with leaf and xylem anatomy and there are tradeoffs between growth and WUE(i) . It is anticipated that some poplar species, e.g. P. × euramericana, are better candidates for water-limited regions and others, e.g. P. cathayana, may be better for water-abundant areas."
2938110	"Most hematopoietic malignancies are comprised of cells that are functionally heterogeneous, with only a subset being responsible for tumor maintenance. These cancer stem cells are so named because they possess qualities reminiscent of normal tissue stem cells including self-renewal, prolonged survival, and the ability to give rise to cells with more differentiated characteristics. Effort is now focused on identifying cancer stem cells in various hematopoietic malignancies, and defining the cells of origin such that the stepwise accumulation of genetic/epigenetic events necessary for cancer stem cell development can be delineated. A detailed understanding of these processes could lead to development of therapeutics that more effectively treat hematopoietic malignancies and potentially other cancers."

It focuses on 'what the call to the future looks like' for both therapies as treatment options for those type 1 diabetes patients who do not respond well to conventional therapy.                                                                                      The major benefit of pancreas transplantation is the reversal of diabetes improvement of diabetes complications. Although the procedure requires major surgery and life-long immunosuppression, it remains the gold standard for a specific population of patients who suffer from type 1 diabetes and who do not respond to conventional therapy. Allogeneic islet transplantation is a promising alternative to pancreas transplantation, but patient outcomes remain less than optimal and significant progress is required in order for this procedure to be considered a reliable therapy.                                                                                     Several factors have to be taken into consideration before making the decision of which of these procedures would better suit a patient with type 1 diabetes."
5155944	"The whole powder of Trigonella foenum graecum seeds and its extracts were tested for their hypoglycemic effect on normal and diabetic model rats. The powder, its methanol extract, and the residue remaining after methanol extraction had significant hypoglycemic effects when fed simultaneously with glucose. The water extract of the methanol extractive-free residue of the seed powder showed significant hypoglycemic activity at different prandial states. The Soluble Dietary Fibre (SDF) fraction showed no effect on the fasting blood glucose levels of nondiabetic or NIDDM model rats. However, when fed simultaneously with glucose, it showed a significant hypoglycemic effect (p <    0.05) in NIDDM model rats. Chemical analysis showed that the major constituent of the SDF is a galactomannan. The results confirm the involvement of SDF in the hypoglycemic effect of T. foenum graecum seeds. However, compound(s) other than SDF is (are) also involved in the hypoglycemic activity."
1962468	"This retrospective analysis was undertaken to evaluate the effect of immediate implant restoration using a computer-assisted technique in partially edentulous sites on interimplant and intertooth bone level stability and papilla formation. Nine partially edentulous patients received a total of 23 implants that supported immediately placed implant restorations. Planning was accomplished using a radiographic guide, which allowed visualization of the emergence profile from the platform of the implant to the cervical of the planned restoration. Guided implants were placed according to the manufacturer's instructions, and restorations were screw retained directly to the implant. Multiple implants were splinted at surgery with autopolymerizing resin. Measurements were made at a mean of 545 days (range 288-958) postoperatively on the basis of radiographs and photographs. Measures were: (1) distance from bone crest to platform, (2) bone crest to contact point, (3) interimplant distance at the outer diameter of the platform, and (4) papilla from highest point to a reference line. At follow-up time, the bone ridge was located higher than the implant platform (mean 0.57 mm) compared to implants whose interimplant distance was less than 3 mm (mean 0.27 mm). Mean increase of the bone level between insertion and approximate 1-year follow-up was 0.047 mm. The mean distance from the contact point to bone was 2.39/3.93 mm postoperatively, resulting in 91/71% papilla fill between implants and between implant and adjacent tooth, respectively. Computer-assisted surgery with the preplanned immediate restoration seems to be an effective method to minimize bone loss at the implant platform resulting in support for papilla."
7566375	"Proper deciphering of abiotic and biotic stresses is essential for plant survival and requires plasticity in response pathway activation. Environmental stress signals are ultimately integrated and transcriptional programs defined inside the nucleus. In animal and plant immunity, various mechanisms help to constrain the activities of transcriptional regulators and transcription factors until an appropriate stimulus releases them from inactive complexes in the cytoplasm, nucleoplasm or at the chromatin to modulate gene expression. Controlling the transport of macromolecules to and from the nucleus and dynamic rearrangements of chromatin-associated transcription complexes emerge as key regulatory processes, permitting flexibility of the plant response to a fluctuating environment with varying pathogen pressure."
1618258	"Oval cells and hepatocytes rarely proliferate simultaneously. This study aimed to determine the impacts of hepatocyte transplantation on the response and fate of oval cells that are activated to proliferate in acute severe hepatic injury. Retrorsine + D-galactosamine (R+D-gal) treatment was used to induce acute hepatic injury and to elicit extensive activation of oval cells in male dipeptidyl peptidase IV-deficient F344 rats. These rats were then randomized to receive wild-type hepatocyte transplantation or vehicle intraportally. The kinetics of oval cell response and their differentiation fate were analyzed. Results showed that oval cells were activated early and differentiated into hepatocytes in R+D-gal-treated rats without hepatocyte transplantation. With hepatocyte transplantation, the oval cells were recruited later and continued to proliferate in parallel with the massive proliferation of transplanted hepatocytes. They formed ductules and differentiated into biliary cells. When hepatocytes were transplanted at the day when oval cells were at their peak response, the numerous activated oval cells ceased to differentiate into hepatocytes and remained in ductular form. The ductular oval cells were capable of differentiating into hepatocytes again when the donor hepatocytes were inhibited to proliferate. We conclude that hepatocyte transplantation changes the mechanism of liver reconstitution and affects the differentiation fate of host oval cells in acute severe hepatic injury."
3383251	"Homeobox genes are essential regulators of plant development. ATHB23, a class I homeodomain leucine zipper gene of Arabidopsis, was found to be induced by treatment with the phytohormone gibberellin (GA). In order to clarify its role in development, we performed a histochemical analysis of transgenic plants containing a construct with a GUS::GFP reporter under the control of the 1.5 kb upstream region of ATHB23. The construct was mainly expressed in young leaves and the styles of flowers but not in mature leaves. Microscopic examination of young leaves revealed that it was expressed in the adaxial domain of leaf primordia and the rib meristem. Expression of ATHB23, like that of GA5 encoding GA 20-oxidase, was reduced in mutants related to adaxial-abaxial leaf polarity (phb-1d, se-2, and kan1 kan2). Reduced expression of the GUS::GFP reporter gene was also observed in an se-2 background. These results indicate that ATHB23 is under the control of GA and other activators such as PHB, and is involved in establishing polarity during leaf development."
9725015	"The authors present a review of surgical complications following cochlear implantation at Great Ormond Street Hospital, since inception of the programme in 1992 until June 2004. Complications are defined as major (resulting in re-operation, explantation, re-implantation or which resulted in permanent serious morbidity or mortality) or minor (where the implant was not threatened). A comparison of surgical complication rates is made both with an earlier study in the same institution and also with other cochlear implantation centres worldwide. The decrease in surgical complication rates is discussed along with the difficulties inherent in cochlear implantation in the paediatric population with coexisting medical complaints."
3846350	"A black, enamel-like deposit is frequently present on injured areas of poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac. This finding can also be produced deliberately as a field test for the toxic nature of the plant. Observing proper precautions, one crushes sap from leaves onto a sheet of white paper. The resulting stain should darken on exposure to the air if it came from a Toxicodendron. This test employs only one quality of these plants, and it is not, therefore, a substitute for other proved means of identification."
4093019	"Nutritional deficiency syndromes, such as scurvy, pellagra, and beriberi are of historical significance but have largely disappeared from modern society. However, certain populations of children in modern society are at risk of severe nutritional complications. The rarity of these syndromes and lack of understanding about modern-day risk factors for nutritional deficiency often delays diagnosis. Dermatologists must maintain an appropriate index of suspicion for these characteristic syndromes as many of the deficiency states present with cutaneous manifestations. Here we review the cutaneous manifestations of macronutrient and micronutrient deficiency syndromes as well as those populations of children that remain at risk for developing severe disease."
2715732	"Questions have been raised as to whether propranolol, which crosses the blood-brain barrier, when used early in life may have an adverse effect on gross motor development. A retrospective survey asking questions about gross motor development was sent to the families of children who had been prescribed oral propranolol for infantile haemangioma at Sydney Children's Hospital between 2008 and 2013. It was found that of the 84 patients surveyed, four were delayed in walking unassisted. There was a statistically significant influence if the child was taking other medications which included prednisolone, vincristine, omeprazole, ranitidine, salbutamol, Flixotide, Timoptol and antibiotics. This was not further analysed in this study because of the low numbers involved. There was no statistically significant influence of gestational age, birth weight or length of time on propranolol. This study adds to the retrospective data available; however large-scale prospective studies are needed to identify unexpected long-term side-effects."
4880854	"In the Netherlands 13.3 million citizens were contacted by the Dutch donor registry to indicate whether they consented or objected to become an organ/tissue donor after death. Nearly 4.7 million individuals are now registered, which is a 35.1% response rate. We wondered whether kidney patients, living kidney donors, and health personnel would have comparable response rates.                                                                                          A total of 239 individuals were interviewed, of whom 52% indicated to be registered. The highest registration rate was found for hospital personnel (66%) followed by living kidney donors (51%) and patients (38%). In general, more women than men (57% vs 47%) had returned their registration form.                                                                                     In the Dutch general public the willingness to make their decision known during life to donate organs/tissue after death is rather low. Presumably motivated individuals (eg, hospital personnel and living kidney donors) scored significantly better, but even in these subgroups 34% and 49%, respectively, were nonresponders."
7797364	"The common heritable loss of scalp hair known as male pattern baldness or androgenetic alopecia affects up to 80% of males by age 80. A balding scalp is characterized by high levels of the potent androgen dihydrotestosterone and increased expression of the androgen receptor gene. To determine if the androgen receptor gene is associated with male pattern baldness, we compared allele frequencies of the androgen receptor gene polymorphisms (StuI restriction fragment length polymorphism and two triplet repeat polymorphisms) in cases with cosmetically significant baldness (54 young and 392 older men) and controls (107 older men) with no indication of baldness. The androgen receptor gene StuI restriction site was found in all but one (98.1%) of the 54 young bald men (p = 0.0005) and in 92.3% of older balding men (p = 0.000004) but in only 76.6% of nonbald men. The combination of shorter CAG and GGC triplet repeat lengths was also more prevalent in bald men (p = 0.03). The ubiquity of the androgen receptor gene StuI restriction site, and higher incidence of shorter triplet repeat haplotypes in bald men suggests that these markers are very close to a functional variant that is a necessary component of the polygenic determination of male pattern baldness. Functional mutation in or near the androgen receptor gene may explain the reported high levels of expression of this gene in the balding scalp."
8792988	"The beet cyst nematode Heterodera schachtii induces syncytia in the roots of Arabidopsis thaliana, which are its only nutrient source. One gene, At1g64110, that is strongly up-regulated in syncytia as shown by RT-PCR, quantitative RT-PCR, in situ RT-PCR and promoter::GUS lines, encodes an AAA+-type ATPase. Expression of two related genes in syncytia, At4g28000 and At5g52882, was not detected or not different from control root segments. Using amiRNA lines and T-DNA mutants, we show that At1g64110 is important for syncytium and nematode development. At1g64110 was also inducible by wounding, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, heat and cold, as well as drought, sodium chloride, abscisic acid and mannitol, indicating involvement of this gene in abiotic stress responses. We confirmed this using two T-DNA mutants that were more sensitive to abscisic acid and sodium chloride during seed germination and root growth. These mutants also developed significantly smaller roots in response to abscisic acid and sodium chloride. An in silico analysis showed that ATPase At1g64110 (and also At4g28000 and At5g52882) belong to the 'meiotic clade' of AAA proteins that includes proteins such as Vps4, katanin, spastin and MSP1."
6065669	"At the University of Miami liver transplantation for chronic liver disease in HCV-positive patients has shown good results, with a 92% patients survival rate (follow up 8 to 57 months, median 21). None the less, we found that a large number of patients are expected to develop serious histological graft damage and may need retransplantation, which may place a further strain on the already scarce donor resources. We have conducted a preliminary investigation on the importance of parameters which may correlate with the prognosis of HCV grafts. We found no impact of HLA match or typing. An interesting hypothesis, which deserves further investigation, is that some HCV strains could be more virulent than others and play a role as an independent risk factor. We have identified six strains among our patients and the BK serotype shows a trend to be associated with a worse outcome. We have found that patients developing and maintaining higher liver enzyme levels (ALT and GGT) after transplant and those with higher levels of viremia may be at risk to develop serious damage to their grafts."
7266675	"Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is a common late complication in lung transplant recipients (LTR). Chlamydia pneumoniae (C. pneumoniae) is a common but difficult to diagnose respiratory pathogen with a propensity to latency.                                                                              We studied the impact of C. pneumoniae on BOS development using donor-recipient serology obtained before transplantation in a cohort of 76 LTR.                                                                              BOS was present in 29.9% patients (mean follow-up 866 days). High donor C. pneumoniae immunoglobulin (Ig)G titers were associated with BOS in the recipient (area under the curve [AUC] 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.52-0.91, P=0.027), whereas high recipient titers were inversely associated with BOS (AUC 0.27, 95% CI 0.11-0.44, P=0.018). The risk of developing BOS was 75.0% in the case of a primary seromismatch for C. pneumoniae (D+/R-), whereas a reverse mismatch had a risk of 4.6% (likelihood ratio 9.8, P=0.02). In a multivariate model that included human leukocyte antigen matching, acute rejection and cytomegalovirus pneumonitis, C. pneumoniae IgG donor 32 or greater and C. pneumoniae IgG recipient 32 or greater remained positive and negative independent risk factors, respectively, for BOS in LTR. In the freedom from BOS analysis, BOS occurred more frequently and earlier in C. pneumoniae seropositive donors, and the reverse was true in seronegative recipients.                                                                                     C. pneumoniae serology in donor and recipient is associated with the development of BOS in LTR."
3624277	"With its incidence of about 40%, acute renal failure (ARF) is a major problem after cadaveric renal transplantation. We have previously shown that, with moderate hydration (2.5 L) of the recipient, together with rapid infusion of 250 ml of mannitol 20% just before clamp removal, the incidence of ARF decreased to below 10%. Administration of mannitol without hydration was not effective. In a prospective randomized trial we have now investigated whether hydration without mannitol is sufficient to prevent ARF. For this purpose patients were randomly allocated to treatment with moderate hydration with or without mannitol. Furthermore, in both treatment groups recipients were randomized to treatment with cyclosporine or azathioprine. The allocation method used guaranteed an even distribution for 10 important prognostic factors. In the cyclosporine group, the percentage of ARF was significantly lower in mannitol-treated (n = 32) than in glucose-treated patients (n = 32) (19% vs. 54%, P less than 0.01). In the azathioprine group the percentage of ARF was also lower in mannitol-treated (n = 33) than in glucose-treated patients (n = 34) (18% vs. 44%, P less than 0.05). Overall incidence of ARF in both groups was significantly lower in mannitol-treated patients (P less than 0.001). Thus, moderate hydration and administration of 250 ml mannitol 20% just before arterial clamp removal are both indispensable for optimal prevention of ARF after cadaveric renal transplantation."
2061064	"The lectin recognition hypothesis proposes that plant lectins mediate specificity in the Rhizobium-legume symbiosis. Although the hypothesis was developed eight years before nod genes were identified in rhizobia and sixteen years before Nod factor was shown to be a major determinant of host specificity, experiments performed recently using transgenic lectin plants support its main tenets."
4787837	"Acral pseudolymphomatous angiokeratoma of children (APACHE) is a condition that was first described in 1990 in a group of children, but has since been described in adults. We present the cases of identical twin patients aged 40 years. The first brother presented with an 8-year history of itchy lesions over the left ankle and the insteps of both feet. After a diagnostic biopsy, he was treated with potent steroids under occlusion for 8 weeks, which resulted in flattening of the lesions and resolution of the pruritus. The second twin had a 20-year history of a very similar presentation but the lesions were less pronounced; he chose not to have treatment. No other family members were affected. Skin biopsies from both patients showed similar changes. Within an overall hyperkeratotic and acanthotic epidermis, there were focal areas of lichenoid change and epidermal thinning. Beneath these areas, there was oedema and nodular aggregates of dense inflammatory cell infiltrate, predominantly lymphocytic infiltrate. APACHE has not been previously described in twins."
9665621	"Arabidopsis thaliana has three membrane-located cytokinin receptors (AHK2, AHK3 and CRE1/AHK4), which are sensor histidine kinases containing a ligand-binding CHASE domain. Despite their structural similarity the role of these receptors differs in planta. Here we have explored which parameters contribute to signal specification. In a bacterial assay, the CHASE domain of AHK2 has a similar ligand binding spectrum as CRE1/AHK4. It shows the highest affinity for isopentenyladenine (iP) and trans-zeatin (tZ) with an apparent K(D) of 1.4 and 4.0 nm, respectively. Real-time PCR analysis of cytokinin primary response genes in double mutants retaining only single receptors revealed that all receptors are activated in planta by cytokinin concentrations in the low nanomolar range. However, there are differences in sensitivity towards the principal cytokinins iP and tZ. The activation of the cytokinin-sensitive P(ARR5) :GUS reporter gene in three different double mutants shows specific, but also overlapping, spatial domains of activity, which were for all receptors predominantly in the shoot apical meristems and root cap columella. AHK2 and AHK3 signal specifically in leaf parenchyma cells, AHK3 in stomata cells, and CRE1/AHK4 in the root vasculature. Promoter-swap experiments demonstrate that CRE1/AHK4 can functionally replace AHK2 but not AHK3. However, the cytoplasmic AHK3 histidine kinase (Hk) domain can be replaced by the CRE1/AHK4 Hk domain, which suggests that functionality is mediated in this case by the extracytosolic domain. Together, the data show that both differential gene expression and ligand preference contribute to specify the receptor activity."
4044724	"Transgenic tobacco plants capable of over-expressing Xenopus PPARα (xPPARα), a transcription factor known to be required for peroxisome proliferation in animals, were recently generated. These plants (herewith referred to as PPAR-OE) were found to have increased peroxisome abundance, higher peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase and catalase activity and modified fatty acid metabolism. Further characterization of PPAR-OE plants revealed a higher susceptibility to virulent and a partial loss of resistance to avirulent Pseudomonas syringae pathogens, whereas the basal resistance response remained unaffected. Biochemical- and defense-related gene expression analyses showed that increased susceptibility to bacterial invasion coincided with the generalized reduction in H(2)O(2) and salicylic acid (SA) levels observed within the first 24 h of bacterial contact. Decreased H(2)O(2) levels were correlated with modified activity levels of catalase and other antioxidant enzymes. A correspondence between a rapid (within 1-24 hpi; ACCO and AOC) and sustained increase (up to 6 days pi; ACCO) in the expression levels of ethylene (ACCO) and jasmonic acid (AOC) biosynthetic genes and a higher susceptibility to virulent bacterial invasion was also observed in PPAR-OE plants. Conversely, no apparent differences in the short- and/or long-term expression levels of markers for the hypersensitive-response, oxidative burst and systemic-acquired resistance were observed between wild type and PPAR-OE plants. The results suggest that peroxisome proliferation could lead to increased susceptibility to bacterial pathogens in tobacco by altering the redox balance of the plant and the expression pattern of key defense signaling pathway genes."
2966818	"Between 5 and 14% of human skin cells, separated by trypsinization, express HLA-DR antigen as detected by indirect immunofluorescence with monoclonal anti-DR antibody. To determine the source and structure of these DR molecules, skin cell suspensions were biosynthetically labeled with 35S-methionine and the radiolabeled DR molecules were analyzed by the method of two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The results indicated the presence of heavy, intermediate, and light chains indistinguishable from those of B lymphocyte DR. Gels in which DR immunoprecipitates from skin cells and autologous lymphocytes were run simultaneously confirmed this finding. Thus, skin cells and lymphocytes synthesize HLA-DR antigen of identical charge and molecular weight."
4116932	"Type 1 phototropin, one of the blue light receptors responsible for phototropism, is encoded in peas by at least two genes, PsPHOT1A and PsPHOT1B (formerly PsPK4 and PsPK5), both of which are more similar to Arabidopsis PHOT1 than to Arabidopsis PHOT2. We show here that PsPHOT1B encodes a full-length phototropin, whose expression pattern suggests that Psphot1b is the predominant phot1-type phototropin in etiolated seedlings. The gene encoding the other type 1 phototropin, PsPHOT1A, is expressed at low levels, with its highest levels in the leaves and stems of more mature, light-grown plants. Studies with phyA, phyB and the phyAphyB double mutants show that phyA and phyB have partially redundant roles in the reduction of PsPHOT1B expression under red light."

2315962	"The acaulis5 (acl5) mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana is defective in the biosynthesis of thermospermine and shows a dwarf phenotype associated with excess xylem differentiation. SAC51 was identified from a dominant suppressor of acl5, sac51-d, and encodes a basic helix-loop-helix protein. The sac51-d mutant has a premature termination codon in an upstream open reading frame (uORF) that is conserved among all four members of the SAC51 family, SAC51 and SACL1-SACL3 This suggests that thermospermine cancels the inhibitory effect of the uORF in main ORF translation. Another suppressor, sac57-d, has a mutation in the conserved uORF of SACL3 To define further the function of the SAC51 family in the thermospermine response, we analyzed T-DNA insertion mutants of each gene. Although sacl1-1 may not be a null allele, the quadruple mutant showed a semi-dwarf phenotype but with an increased level of thermospermine and decreased sensitivity to exogenous thermospermine that normally represses xylem differentiation. The sac51-1 sacl3-1 double mutant was also insensitive to thermospermine. These results suggest that SAC51 and SACL3 play a key role in thermospermine-dependent negative control of thermospermine biosynthesis and xylem differentiation. Using 5' leader-GUS (β-glucuronidase) fusion constructs, however, we detected a significant enhancement of the GUS activity by thermospermine only in SAC51 and SACL1 constructs. Furthermore, while acl5-1 sac51-1 showed the acl5 dwarf phenotype, acl5-1 sacl3-1 exhibited an extremely tiny-plant phenotype. These results suggest a complex regulatory network for the thermospermine response in which SAC51 and SACL3 function in parallel pathways."

This delay in diagnosis can affect tumor growth, metastatic potential, and prognosis.                                                                                   We describe the ""head-tilt maneuver,"" which highlights the vascular nature of these lesions and can be of potential benefit in early recognition and better appreciation of the clinical extent of this tumor.                                                                                     Early recognition and aggressive management of these tumors can afford the best opportunity for cure."
9635359	"Patients with lupus erythematosus (LE) are often abnormally photosensitive. Ultraviolet (UV) exposure can not only induce cutaneous lesions but may also contribute to systemic flares and disease progression. Various forms of energy-efficient lighting have been shown to emit UV radiation.                                                                                   To determine the effects of these emissions on individuals with LE.                                                                              This assessment investigated cutaneous responses to repeated exposures from three types of lighting: compact fluorescent lamp (CFL), light-emitting diode (LED) and energy-efficient halogen (EEH). The subjects were 15 patients with LE and a control group of five healthy volunteers.                                                                              No cutaneous LE lesions were induced by any of the light sources. Delayed skin erythema was induced at the site of CFL irradiation in six of the 15 patients with LE and two of the five healthy subjects. Erythema was increased in severity and more persistent in patients with LE. One patient with LE produced a positive delayed erythema to the EEH. A single patient with LE produced immediate abnormal erythemal responses to the CFL, LED and EEH. Further investigation revealed that this patient also had solar urticaria. All other subjects had negative responses to LED exposure.                                                                                      Compact fluorescent lamps emit UV that can induce skin erythema in both individuals with LE and healthy individuals when situated in close proximity. However, this occurs to a greater extent and is more persistent in patients with LE. EEHs emit UVA that can induce erythema in patients with LE. LEDs provide a safer alternative light source without risk of UV exposure."
9658965	"The hair cycle is an extraordinarily complex process relying on spatially and temporally coordinated integration of intercellular signaling, cell division and death, cell migration, and gene expression. The hairless gene (hr) is expressed with hair-cycle-dependent kinetics, and pathogenic mutations in hr are responsible for the hairless and rhino phenotypes in mice and atrichia with papular lesions in humans. In addition to its expression in the skin and hair follicle, hr is also highly expressed in the brain, yet the factors governing its differential cell-type-specific expression have not yet been defined. A thyroid hormone responsive element was previously identified in the rat hr promoter which confers thyroid hormone (T3) responsiveness to heterologous promoter constructs; however, prior studies have not focused on the hr promoter itself. The hairless promoter was cloned, and it is shown that the hr promoter is transactivated by T3 in neuroblastoma cells but not in keratinocytes. Therefore, while T3 has a significant role in the regulation of neuronal expression of hairless, its upregulation in keratinocytes is T3 independent. Furthermore, hr is subject to cell-type-specific negative autoregulation, inhibiting the activity of its own promoter in keratinocytes but not neuroblastoma cells. These findings illustrate a molecular distinction between the regulation of hr expression in defined cell populations."
6711768	"Epidermal keratinocytes are continuously exposed to mechanical forces. The human skin surface can be thickened and enlarged by various stresses such as tissue expander or abrasive pressure. To investigate the mechanism of epidermal hyperproliferation by mechanical stress, keratinocytes were plated on flexible silicone dishes, which were continuously stretched by +20%. Stretching of cells for 24 h caused upregulation of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive cells to 200%-220% and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK)1/2. Inhibition of mitogen and ERK with U0126 and phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase attenuated BrdU incorporation and ERK1/2 activation. The EGF receptor kinase inhibitor and the calcium channel inhibitor also inhibited BrdU incorporation and the activation of ERK1/2. Twenty-four hours of stretching stimulated reporter activity driven by activator protein 1 (AP-1), induction of K6, and suppression of K10, which were inhibited by U0126. Our results indicate that mechanical stretching induces proliferative signals on human keratinocytes via induction of calcium influx, phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and ERK1/2. These mechanisms may contribute to the hyperproliferative nature of the epidermis, which is mechanically stretched by various stimuli."
6138395	"There is a subgroup of atopic dermatitis (AD) patients with normal total and specific IgE levels and negative skin tests towards common allergens. This form of the disease has been referred to as the 'intrinsic' form of AD. Although previous studies have demonstrated differences in the cytokine profile between the extrinsic and intrinsic subtypes, the pathogenesis of both subtypes of AD remains unclear.                                                                                   To compare the inflammatory micromilieu in both forms of AD.                                                                              Immunophenotyping of the inflammatory cells was performed in lesional and nonlesional skin from 18 patients with extrinsic and 17 with intrinsic AD.                                                                              Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a high proportion of CD4+ T cells in the dermis, with a similar CD4/CD8 ratio in the two groups. The expression levels of other T-cell markers and epidermal Langerhans cells were increased in both forms of AD. Although the T-cell repertoires in the two subtypes were similar, dermal infiltration of eosinophils and eosinophil granular proteins was more prominent in the extrinsic type than in the intrinsic type. Eotaxin immunoreactivity was also significantly higher in the extrinsic subtype.                                                                                      The data suggest that although the overall inflammatory microenvironment in the two subtypes appears to be similar, differences in T-cell cytokine production might contribute to the differential tissue eosinophilia in these subtypes."
4715403	"Chloroplasts contain several thousand different proteins, of which more than 95% are encoded on nuclear genes, synthesized in the cytosol as precursor proteins, and imported into the organelle. The major pathways for import and routing have been described; a general import apparatus in the chloroplast envelope and several ancestral translocases in the thylakoid membranes. In this update we focus on some interesting and emerging areas: the Tat translocase, which operates in parallel with the Sec system but transports folded proteins; different routes to the envelope membranes, which promises an understanding of the ways the Tic apparatus sorts transmembrane domains (TMDs) and may also uncover developmental relationships between envelope and thylakoids; and novel routes for proteins into chloroplasts including delivery from the secretory system."

4441743	"CD24 or Nectadrin is a cell surface glycoprotein expressed in pre-B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, neurons, muscle cells and carcinoma cells. Its function is not completely known, but it has been suggested that it is involved in cell adhesion and signalling. CD24 has recently been identified as the human molecule homologous to the murine heat-stable antigen (HSA). HSA is expressed by murine keratinocytes and delivers costimulatory signals in T-cell activation. Long-term cultures of normal human keratinocytes (HKC) were obtained from skin of human female breast sections and either left untreated or were treated with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) at 10-100 ng/ml, calcium 0.5-2 mM or IFN-gamma 100-1000 U/ml, for 24-48 h. Using RT-PCR and flow cytometry we showed that HKC express low levels of CD24 even under basal conditions, and the treatment with calcium, PMA or IFN-gamma increased levels of CD24 mRNA and protein. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to measure CD24 expression and production by cultured HKC in basal conditions and after stimulation. Further studies are needed to determine biological and therapeutical relevance of these findings."
6835808	"Although female pattern hair loss (FPHL) has been considered simply the female counterpart of male pattern hair loss in men, the risk factors may differ.                                                                                  We sought to evaluate factors associated with FPHL and to estimate its prevalence in women.                                                                             In total, 26,226 subjects aged 30 years and older participated in a cross-sectional survey. Ludwig and Norwood classifications were used to assess the degree of hair loss. Information on possible risk factors for FPHL was collected using a questionnaire interview.                                                                              The prevalence of FPHL (Ludwig grade >   I) for all ages was 11.8% (95% CI 11.5%-12.2%), increasing with advancing age. After controlling for age and family history, statistically significant associations were noted between FPHL and high fasting glucose (odds ratio [OR] 1.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.28), fewer childbirths (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.12-1.38), breast-feeding (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78-0.98), oral contraceptive use (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.01-1.45), and ultraviolet exposure more than 16 hours per week (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.02-1.22).                                                                                      The validity and reliability of FPHL classification may be not perfect in this survey and may need to be verified. Information on family history may be still subject to recall bias.

6202404	"Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a major obstacle to safe allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation, leading to significant mortality. Recently, T-helper (TH)-17 cells have been shown to play a central role in mediating several autoimmune diseases. The aim of our study was to investigate the relationship between TH-17 cells and GVHD occurring in transplanted patients.                                                                              Blood samples were collected from 51 hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation patients and 15 healthy donors. Patients with GVHD were monitored for the presence of TH-17 cells by ELISPOT or flow cytometry in the peripheral blood and by confocal microscopy in GVHD lesions. Cytokine plasma levels were detected by ELISA.                                                                              An increased TH-17 population (up to 4.8% of peripheral blood CD4+T lymphocytes) was observed in patients with acute GVHD and (up to 2.4%) in patients with active chronic GVHD along with an inflammatory process. In contrast, the percentage of TH-17 cells drastically decreased in patients with inactive chronic GVHD. TH-17 cells consisted of both interleukin (IL)-17+/interferon (IFN)-gamma- and IL-17+/IFN-gamma+ subsets and expressed IL-23 receptor. Interestingly, IFN-gamma+ TH-17 cells were able to infiltrate GVHD lesions as observed in liver and skin sections. Moreover, the proportion of TH-17 was inversely correlated with the proportion of regulatory T cells observed in the peripheral blood and tissues affected by GVHD. Finally, we demonstrated a strong correlation between TH-17 levels and the clinical status of patients with GVHD.                                                                                      These findings support the hypothesis that TH-17 are involved in the active phases of GVHD and may represent a novel cellular target for developing new strategies for GVHD treatment."
2426629	"Biomaterials are commonly used to augment the maxillary sinus floor prior to or in conjunction with dental implant installation. Recently, porous titanium granules (PTGs) have been used in oral implant surgery to stabilize implants and function as an osteoconductive matrix.                                                                                To evaluate if PTGs can be safely used in a larger population of patients, treated by different surgeons, when sinus floor augmentation was required in conjunction with implant installation. The primary endpoint was 12-month survival rate of the dental implants. Biopsies for histology were taken from the augmented area.                                                                                            At five centers, 40 subjects with uni or bilateral posterior edentulism and atrophy of the posterior maxilla (3-6 mm) were enrolled. In a single-stage procedure, PTG and one to three dental implants were installed in each quadrant. In total, 70 implants were included in the study.                                                                              One immobile implant was removed. The mean marginal bone loss was 0.5 mm and 0.8 mm, on the mesial and distal side, respectively. Histologically, all biopsies demonstrated bone ingrowth.                                                                                      The results suggest that PTG can be safely and effectively used as augmentation material in the sinus floor when used with dental implants in a one-stage procedure."
9029349	"Plants colonized terrestrial environments approximately 480 million years ago and have contributed significantly to the diversification of life on Earth. Phylogenetic analyses position a subset of charophyte algae as the sister group to land plants, and distinguish two land plant groups that diverged around 450 million years ago - the bryophytes and the vascular plants. Relationships between liverworts, mosses hornworts and vascular plants have proven difficult to resolve, and as such it is not clear which bryophyte lineage is the sister group to all other land plants and which is the sister to vascular plants. The lack of comparative molecular studies in representatives of all three lineages exacerbates this uncertainty. Such comparisons can be made between mosses and liverworts because representative model organisms are well established in these two bryophyte lineages. To date, however, a model hornwort species has not been available.                                                                              Here we report the establishment of Anthoceros agrestis as a model hornwort species for laboratory experiments. Axenic culture conditions for maintenance and vegetative propagation have been determined, and treatments for the induction of sexual reproduction and sporophyte development have been established. In addition, protocols have been developed for the extraction of DNA and RNA that is of a quality suitable for molecular analyses. Analysis of haploid-derived genome sequence data of two A. agrestis isolates revealed single nucleotide polymorphisms at multiple loci, and thus these two strains are suitable starting material for classical genetic and mapping experiments.                                                                                      Methods and resources have been developed to enable A. agrestis to be used as a model species for developmental, molecular, genomic, and genetic studies. This advance provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the biology of hornworts."
4127005	"Abstract Intense pulsed light (IPL) has been used extensively to treat striae distensae (SD). Twenty-four patients (21 females and 3 males) with age ranging between 15-42 years with a mean of 24.2 ± 5.89 years were included in this study. All patients were treated with IPL for five sessions and were given 4-week interval between the sessions. Formalin-fixed, paraffin- embedded skin biopsies were cut into 5-μm-thick sections from patients before and after treatments. They were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&    E) and collagen with Masson trichrome stain. Histological examination of SD revealed epidermal thinning, flattened rete ridges, and fragmentation with degeneration of the collagen and elastic fibers. After IPL treatments, collagen expression was found also to be increased in a highly significant manner and P values were <    0.001 after IPL treatments. The use of synchrotron infrared (IR) microspectroscopy also revealed that amide 1 and beta sheets were expressed in a significant manner after IPL treatment. In conclusion, it was demonstrated that IPL can treat striae through fibroblast stimulation which led to protein expression especially collagen stimulation, and it seems that it is a promising therapeutic modality for striae with minimal side effects."
8071152	"A significant proportion of patients seen by dermatologists have skin disease complicated by a psychiatric condition. These conditions often give rise to social, legal, and ethical concerns which impede the proper treatment of these patients, commonly involving the prescription of anti-psychotics for non-psychotic indications. This paper clarifies the social, legal, and ethical matters which frustrate the treatment and recovery of patients from their complex psycho-dermatologic disease. Specifically, this paper addresses the ethical and legal issues associated with prescribing anti-psychotics for non-psychotic indications. The presented data shows that the internationally prevalent medical practice of prescribing anti-psychotics for non-psychotic indications is not only ethical and legal, but also an essential treatment modality in the field of dermatology."
6313168	"Lyme disease is sporadically observed in Japan since the first report in 1987. We have experienced 19 cases of Lyme disease. In 12 out of 13 trials we succeeded in isolating Borrelia strains (JEM1-12) from erythema migrans (EM) lesions. Recently, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato was classified into at least three distinct subgroups, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. garinii and B. afzelii.                                                                                  In order to characterize Lyme disease in Japan, we summarized the clinical features of our cases and investigated the nature of the isolated Borrelia strains.                                                                              The 12 Borrelia strains were analyzed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of ribosomal RNA gene.                                                                              Most of our 19 patients were in stage I with EM as the main clinical manifestation. RFLP analysis using 12 strains isolated from the patients indicated that 8 strains (group IV, V) were different from the three aforementioned genospecies.                                                                                     Clinical data from the present study substantiate the view that Japanese Lyme disease has a relatively milder course. We speculate that this may be related to the specific Borrelia strains in Japan."
5137098	"Fractionated TBI (FTBI) followed by allogeneic hematopoietic SCT results in donor engraftment and improves survival in children with high-risk hematologic malignancies. However, acute toxicities (skin, lung and mucosa) are common after FTBI. Late complications include cataracts, endocrine dysfunction, sterility and impaired neurodevelopment. Instead of FTBI, we used low-dose single fraction TBI (550 cGy) with CY as transplant conditioning for pediatric hematologic malignancies. GVHD prophylaxis included CYA and short-course MTX; methylprednisolone was added for unrelated donor transplants. A total of 55 children in first (40%) or second remission and beyond (60%) underwent transplantation from BM (65%) or peripheral blood; 62% from unrelated donors; 22% were mismatched. Median follow-up was 18.5 months (1-68). Overall survival and disease-free survival at 1 year were 60 and 47%, respectively. Acute toxicities included grade 3-4 mucositis (18%), invasive infections (11%), multiorgan failure/shock (11%), hemolytic anemia (7%), veno-occlusive disease (4%) and renal failure (4%). TRM was 11% at 100 days. Non-relapse mortality was 6% thereafter. Graft rejection occurred in 2%. Three patients (5%) died of GVHD. The regimen was well tolerated even in heavily pretreated children and supported donor cell engraftment; long-term follow up is in progress."
7462812	"A 6-year-old girl presented for evaluation of skin discoloration. Examination revealed oval and oblong hypopigmented macules on her trunk and extremities. Cytogenetic studies and immunohistochemistry of biopsies from normally pigmented and hypopigmented skin revealed mosaicism for partial tetrasomy for 13q with low melanocyte levels in lesional skin. The patient was diagnosed with phylloid hypomelanosis (PH), a distinct clinical entity linked to abnormalities in chromosome 13. This article reviews the literature regarding PH and supports the notion that mosaicism of the melanocyte region of chromosome 13q is responsible for PH."
3814636	"Pokeweed (Phytolacca americana) has recently received much attention because of its ability to hyperaccumulate manganese (Mn). The internal mechanism of detoxification of Mn, however, is not fully understood. In the present study, we investigated Mn accumulation, subcellular distribution, chemical speciation and detoxification through oxalate in pokeweed. The plant accumulated excess Mn in the leaves, mainly in the water-soluble fraction, and over 80% of Mn was in a water-soluble form, while accumulation of excess Mn in the cellular organelle and membrane fraction caused phytotoxicity. In addition, pokeweed has an intrinsically high oxalate content. In all experiments, there was sufficient oxalate to chelate Mn in leaf water extracts at all different levels of Mn application. Phase analysis of X-ray diffraction detected oxalate-Mn chelate complexes, and gel chromatography further confirmed the chelation of Mn by oxalate. In conclusion, pokeweed accumulates excess Mn in the soluble fraction of leaf cells, most likely in vacuoles, in which detoxification of Mn could be achieved by chelation with oxalate."

The aim of the present study was to determine the whole-body biodistribution and clearance of technetium-99m ((99m)Tc)-labeled rat and human BM-MSCs after IA delivery in a rat model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Our hypothesis was that xenotransplantation has a major impact on the behavior of cells. Male RccHan:Wistar rats were subjected to sham operation or MCAO. Twenty-four hours after surgery, BM-MSCs (2 × 10(6) cells/animal) labeled with (99m)Tc were infused into the external carotid artery. Whole-body SPECT images were acquired 20 min, 3 h, and 6 h postinjection, after which rats were sacrificed, and organs were collected and weighed for measurement of radioactivity. The results showed that the majority of the cells were located in the brain and especially in the ipsilateral hemisphere immediately after cell infusion both in sham-operated and MCAO rats. This was followed by fast disappearance, particularly in the case of human cells. At the same time, the radioactivity signal increased in the spleen, kidney, and liver, the organs responsible for destroying cells. Further studies are needed to demonstrate whether differential cell behavior has any functional impact."
5182854	"Characterizing the molecular mechanism involved in nonhost disease resistance is important to understand the adaptations of plant-pathogen interactions. In this study, virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS)-based forward genetics screen was utilized to identify genes involved in nonhost resistance in Nicotiana benthamiana. Genes encoding ribosomal proteins, RPL12 and RPL19, were identified in the screening. These genes when silenced in N. benthamiana caused a delay in nonhost bacteria induced hypersensitive response (HR) with concurrent increase in nonhost bacterial multiplication. Arabidopsis mutants of AtRPL12 and AtRPL19 also compromised nonhost resistance. The studies on NbRPL12 and NbRPL19 double silenced plants suggested that both RPL12 and RPL19 act in the same pathway to confer nonhost resistance. Our work suggests a role for RPL12 and RPL19 in nonhost disease resistance in N. benthamiana and Arabidopsis. In addition, we show that these genes also play a minor role in basal resistance against virulent pathogens."
8463333	"We present a new efficient screening tool for detection of S-alleles in apple. The protocol using general and multiplexed primers for PCR reaction and fragment detection on an automatized capillary DNA sequencer exposed a higher number of alleles than any previous studies. Analysis of alleles is made on basis of three individual fragment sizes making the allele interpretation highly accurate. The method was employed to genotype 432    Malus     accessions and exposed 25 different S-alleles in a selection of    Malus domestica     cultivars of mainly Danish origin (402 accessions) as well as a selection of other    Malus     species (30 accessions). The allele S3 (28 %) was the most common among the Danish cultivars followed by S1 and S7 (both 27 %). The alleles S36 and S40 not previously reported from    M    .    domestica     were found in 6 and 17 cultivars, respectively. Complete allelic composition was found in 91 % of the 369 diploid accessions and in 86 % of the 63 triploids concerned. We further identified a relatively high frequency of S33 and S34, which has not been considered by most previous studies. The protocol presented here is easy to adopt and saves both time and work effort compared to previous methods. The robustness is illustrated by the great accuracy and a high number of S-alleles presented."

However, the association between HRQOL outcomes and more substantial degrees of Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) response and physician and patient global ratings remains ill defined.                                                                                  This study examined the relationship between achieving a 75% or >    or =90% improvement in PASI and HRQOL outcome measures.                                                                              Secondary analyses were completed using data for 1,469 patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis from two adalimumab clinical trials. HRQOL was measured via the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and the Short Form 36 (SF 36) Health Survey. Clinical response was assessed by the PASI, physician's global assessment and patient's global assessment status scores. Clinical response was categorized into 6 groups based on PASI response: <   25% (n = 332); 25 to <   50% (n = 137); 50 to <   75% (n = 170); 75 to <   90% (n = 288); 90 to <   100% (n = 255), and 100% (n = 192). Analysis of covariance models compared baseline measures and 16-week changes in HRQOL scores.                                                                              Statistically significant differences were observed between PASI response groups in DLQI total scores and in SF 36 summary and scale scores (p <    0.0001). The PASI 100 and PASI 90 to <   100 groups demonstrated a >   10-point decrease in DLQI total scores. Moreover, these changes were statistically significantly greater than those observed for the PASI 75 to <   90 group (p <    0.001) and the other PASI response groups (p <    0.001). For the SF 36, the greatest changes were observed in the PASI 75 to <   90, PASI 90 to <   100 and PASI 100 groups, which all had improvements of >   4 points in the Mental Component and Physical Component Summary (MCS and PCS) scores. Statistically significantly greater differences in DLQI total and SF 36 summary and scale scores were also observed between patient's global assessment categories (p <    0.0001) and between physician's global assessment categories (p <    0.0001).                                                                                     Improvement in PASI response of >   75% corresponded to improvements in HRQOL outcome measures for patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. PASI 90 or 100 responders had greater improvements in DLQI total score than PASI 75 responders."
8345856	"The use of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) conditioning regimens has reduced the incidence of graft-versus-host disease, particularly in its chronic form. The impact of this approach on the prevention of lung dysfunction has not been well characterized, however. We performed a retrospective analysis of pulmonary function in patients who underwent HSCT after conditioning with oral busulfan followed by either cyclophosphamide or fludarabine with or without the addition of ATG. A total of 393 patients were included; 75 patients received ATG, and 318 did not. No differences between the 2 groups were seen in the mean percentage of the predicted values for forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)), forced vital capacity (FVC), total lung capacity, and lung CO diffusing capacity at 80 days or 1 year after transplantation. However, the mean value of FEV(1)/FVC ratio at 1 year was higher in the patients who received ATG. The difference in mean change in pulmonary function parameters from baseline to 1 year post-HSCT was statistically nonsignificant for all parameters except FEV(1)/FVC ratio, which demonstrated less decline in the ATG group. The risk of developing severe airflow obstruction or a restrictive pattern was similar in the 2 treatment groups at 1 year post-HSCT. Incorporation of ATG into the HSCT conditioning regimen provided protection against a decline in FEV(1)/FVC ratio but did not decrease the risk of other pulmonary events that we evaluated within the first year after HSCT. Further evaluations in larger numbers of patients are needed to better clarify the role of ATG in the development of delayed pulmonary complications."
5664495	"Febrile ulceronecrotic Mucha-Habermann disease (FUMHD) is a rare subtype of pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta, characterized by an acute onset of ulceronecrotic papules, rapidly coalescing into large ulcers with necrotic crusts, associated with high fever and severe systemic symptoms. We report a case of a 65-year-old woman with a resistant form of FUMHD successfully treated with a tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) inhibitor (infliximab). After 1 year of treatment, because of the recurrence of lesions and -occurrence of severe sepsis, we decided to change the therapeutic procedure by introducing intravenous immunoglobulin witch induced a spectacular improvement. Only few cases of FUMHD treated with intravenous immunoglobulin have been reported to date. In our case, we describe the first utilization of TNFα inhibitors in the treatment of FUMHD: TNFα inhibitors may be useful, particularly in resistant cases. Further reports are required to confirm this potential therapeutic option."
3976924	"Wound healing has been shown to be altered in diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study was to identify the effects of streptozotocin-induced diabetes on osseointegration. Diabetes was induced in 40-day-old rats by intraperitoneal injection of 70 mg per kg streptozotocin. At 14 days postinjection, implants were placed in the femora of 10 diabetic and 10 age-matched normal rats. Animals were sacrificed at 28 and 56 days following implantation. Histometric results indicated that the quantity of bone formation was similar for diabetic and control animals (P >    .05). However, less bone-implant contact was observed for diabetic compared to control animals at both 28 and 56 days (P <    .0001). This study demonstrates that the process of osseointegration is affected by streptozotocin-induced diabetes."
9970021	"Lung transplantation appears to be a therapeutic alternative for selected patients with end-stage pulmonary vascular and/or parenchymal disease. The greatest impediment to transplantation remains the availability of donor organs. This has become more significant as additional transplant centers become operational. The primary cause of death has been infection, and this most frequently occurs in the early post-transplant period. Significant progress has been made in curbing the morbidity and mortality from bacterial pneumonia and CMV infection, and this is the primary reason for improved survival rates. If the recipient survives the initial hospital stay, the likelihood of survival at 5 years is approximately 80%. The primary long-term complication is obliterative bronchiolitis which is poorly understood and difficult to treat. Nevertheless, the improvement in survival provides impetus to refine and improve the procedure so that survival can reach that attained by recipients of other major organ allografts."
8047863	"Splenectomy is an effective technique in living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) with small-for-size (SFS) liver grafts for overcoming SFS liver graft injury. However, the protective mechanism of splenectomy is still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate how splenectomy could attenuate SFS graft injury through the measurement of biochemical factors, particularly the expression of endothelin (ET)-1, which is a key molecule of microcirculatory disorders by mediating sinusoidal vasoconstriction. We performed rat orthotopic liver transplantation using SFS liver grafts with or without splenectomy. We investigated intragraft expression of ET-1 mRNA and hepatic protein levels of ET-1. In addition, portal pressure, hepatic injury and morphological changes, and survival rate were evaluated. In result, intragraft ET-1 mRNA expression after SFS liver transplantation was significantly downregulated by splenectomy, and hepatic expression of ET-1 in SFS grafts was rarely observed. Splenectomy inhibited the increase in portal pressure, ameliorated SFS liver graft injury and improved the graft survival rate after SFS liver transplantation. In conclusion, splenectomy improved the SFS liver injury and decreased the expression of ET-1 by attenuating portal hypertension on SFS liver transplantation. Downregulation of intragraft ET-1 expression plays important roles in the protective mechanism of splenectomy in SFS liver transplantation."
3805998	"Erythema elevatum diutinum (EED) is a rare chronic vasculitic process of unknown etiology that presents as bilateral, symmetrical, periarticular, red-brown papules and plaques, often over dorsa of joints. Early histologic changes are characterized by leukocytoclastic vasculitis. With chronicity, the lesions develop dense neutrophilic infiltrate and fibrosis. We describe an unusual case of late-stage nodular EED present for 35 years in a seronegative 75-year-old man. Asymptomatic papules and plaques measuring from 0.7 to 9.0 cm were seen over the interphalangeal joints, elbows, knees, and ankles. The histologic findings were characterized by predominant concentric fibrosis that formed well-circumscribed dermal and subcutaneous nodules. Awareness of this unusual presentation of EED helps to avoid misdiagnosis as cutaneous neoplasms."
4674349	"Dermatologists are increasingly confronted with patients affected by body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). BDD is characterized by excessive preoccupation with one or more perceived defect(s) or flaw(s) in physical appearance which are not observable or appear slight to others. So far, there have been only few studies examining the prevalence of BDD in dermatological outpatients. In addition, the need for psychotherapeutic support in dermatological outpatients with body dysmorphic concerns has not yet been systematically examined. The objective of the present study was therefore to investigate the frequency of body dysmorphic concerns as well as social adaptation and the need for psychotherapeutic support in the aforementioned patient group.                                                                                           A total of 252 dermatological outpatients seen at a German university hospital were consecutively enrolled, and examined using the Dysmorphic Concerns Questionnaire, the Social Adaptation Self-Evaluation Scale, and the German version of the University of Rhode Island Change Assessment Scale.                                                                              7.9 % of all outpatients (unselected sample) showed positive test results, suggesting clinically relevant body dysmorphic concerns. Patients with clinically relevant body dysmorphic concerns exhibited poor social adaptation. Contrary to expectations, these patients revealed a high motivation for change, indicating the necessity for psychotherapeutic support.                                                                                      Our findings confirm previous prevalence rates of BDD in dermatological outpatients, and highlight the need for providing psychotherapeutic support to dermatological patients."
6865200	"Cadaveric renal retransplantation is associated with a higher risk of early graft failure than primary grafts. A large proportion of those graft losses is likely attributable to donor-directed HLA class I antibodies, detectable by flow cytometry cross-matching but not by conventional crossmatching techniques.                                                                              Long-term graft survival in a group of 106 recipients of consecutive cadaveric renal regrafts between 1990 and 1997, in whom a negative flow T-cell IgG crossmatch was required for transplantation, was compared with two other groups of cadaveric transplant recipients. The first group consisted of 174 cadaveric regrafts transplanted between 1985 and 1995 using only a negative anti-human globulin (AHG) T-cell IgG crossmatch. The second group was primary cadaveric transplants done concurrently with the flow group (1990 to 1997) using only the AHG T-cell IgG crossmatch.                                                                              The long-term (7 year) graft survival rate of flow crossmatch-selected regraft recipients (68%; n= 106) was significantly improved over that of regraft recipients who were selected for transplantation by only the AHG crossmatch technique (45%; n=174; log-rank=0.001; censored for patients dying with a functioning graft). Graft outcome for the flow cross-matched regraft recipients was not significantly different from that of primary cadaveric patients (72%; n=889; log-rank=0.2; censored for patients dying with a functioning graft). Finally, a positive B-cell IgG flow cytometric crossmatch had no influence on long-term regraft outcome.                                                                                      The use of the flow T-cell IgG cross-match as the exclusion criterion for cadaveric renal retransplantation yields an improved long-term graft outcome over that obtained when only the AHG cross-match is used and has improved survival of regraft recipients to the level of our primary cadaveric renal transplant population."
2342998	"Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) is the most common type of chronic urticaria, and pruritus is the most prominent symptom. Antihistamines are the first-line treatment for CIU. Sedation and anticholinergic adverse effects are often experienced with the first-generation antihistamines and there is a risk of cardiovascular adverse effects and drug interactions with some second-generation agents. Hence, new treatment options are needed. Desloratadine is a new, potent, nonsedating antihistamine that has an excellent cardiovascular safety profile.                                                                              This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to determine the efficacy and safety of desloratadine in the treatment of moderate-to-severe CIU. A total of 190 patients, aged 12-79 years, with at least a 6-week history of CIU and who were currently experiencing a flare of at least moderate severity, were randomly assigned to therapy with desloratadine 5 mg or placebo once daily for 6 weeks. Twice daily, patients rated the severity of CIU symptoms (pruritus, number of hives, and size of largest hive), as well as the impact of CIU symptoms on sleep and daily activity. Patients and investigators jointly evaluated therapeutic response and overall condition. Safety evaluations included the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events, discontinuations due to adverse events, and changes from baseline in vital signs, laboratory parameters, and ECG intervals.                                                                              Desloratadine was superior to placebo in controlling pruritus and total symptoms after the first dose and maintained this superiority to the end of the study. Measures of sleep, daily activity, therapeutic response, and global CIU status were also significantly better with desloratadine after the first dose; these clinical benefits were also maintained throughout the 6-week study. No significant adverse events occured.                                                                                      Desloratadine 5 mg daily is a safe and effective treatment for CIU with significant benefits within 24 h and maintained through the treatment period."
4899271	"Increasing numbers of patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are referred for liver transplant (LT). Our objective was to characterize patients with NASH among referred LT candidates (from 1998 to 2008), and we compared demographics, etiology of liver disease, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, cardiac disease, cancer, laboratory data, model for end-stage liver disease (MELD), and outcomes between NASH and non-NASH patients. Patients with NASH (n = 71) were compared to other chronic liver disease (n = 472). Patients with NASH were older (58.7 vs. 52.5 yr, p <    0.0001), Asian (53.5% vs. 34.7%, p = 0.03) and women (50.7% vs. 32.1%, p = 0.003). Patients with NASH had more diabetes, hypertension, obesity, cardiac disease, and smoking history (p <    0.05). Patients with NASH were equally likely to have liver cancer, but more likely to have non-liver cancers (20.8% vs. 4.4%, p = 0.008). There was no difference in MELD, but patients with NASH had lower protime/international normalized ratio (1.14 vs. 1.27, p = 0.04) and higher creatinine (1.26 vs. 0.98 mg/dL, p = 0.0018). Patients with NASH were equally likely to undergo evaluation, listing, and transplantation compared to non-NASH patients. While all patients with chronic liver disease can have renal dysfunction because of hepatorenal syndrome, patients with NASH have more renal dysfunction, perhaps related to diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Transplant centers should consider this carefully in selection of candidates for LT."
3704719	We report a case of malignant mesothelioma in which the tissue diagnosis was established by examination of a skin biopsy specimen. We also review the cutaneous manifestations of malignant mesothelioma. To our knowledge this is only the second reported case diagnosed primarily by examination of tissue from the skin.
8527591	"Islet and pancreas transplantation may compete for a limited number of organs. We analyzed records from the national Swiss transplant registry during a 4-year period to investigate the proportion of donors that are suitable for islet and pancreas transplantation. Suitability for pancreas transplantation was mainly defined as: age 10-45 years; weight <   or= 80 kg; BMI <   or= 25 kg/m(2); amylasemia <   or= 150 U/l; ICU stay <   or= 3 days and absence of severe hypotension (MAP <   or= 60 mmHG). Between 1.1.1997 and 31.12.2000, data of 407 donors were collected, from which 321 donors were included in the study. Thirty-three (10%), 143 (45%), and 23 (7%) donors fulfilled the criteria for pancreas, islet transplantation, and both procedures, respectively. Giving priority to pancreas transplantation and accepting the absence of one selection criterion, 90 (28%) pancreas and 100 (31%) islet donors were identified. We conclude that with current allocation policies prioritizing pancreas transplantation, pancreas and islet transplantation may coexist with little competition."
3803113	A printed questionnaire can be used to help uncover the reason(s) for acne flares or failures in response. This method not only enhances office efficiency but is suprisingly thorough and well accepted by patients. A sample form is presented and its proper use is discussed in the text.
6283835	"Nail psoriasis occurs in 7% to 40% of children, with a similar pattern of clinical presentation to that of adults. In 0.6% to 2.3% of the patients nail changes appear as the only sign of the disease, preceding other skin and articular involvement. No pediatric clinical trials are available yet, but considering the successful use of tazarotene for nail dystrophy therapy in adults, we chose this drug to treat a child."

Here we introduce the concept of Heterotic Haplotype Capture (HHC), in which genome sequence imputation is used to trace novel heterozygous chromosome blocks contributing to hybrid performance in large, structured populations of interrelated F1 hybrids containing interesting new diversity for breeding."
9266507	A 56-year-old woman presented with a 3-month history of erythematous plaques covered by scales and limited to the right side of her body. The plaques were arranged along Blaschko's lines with a marked mid-line cutoff. The histopathologic analysis of a skin biopsy in conjunction with the anamnesis allowed the diagnosis of linear psoriasis. Our patient showed a good clinical response to antipsoriatic treatment.
2425539	"A simplified comedogenic assay is described in which test materials are applied for 2 weeks to the ears of rabbits just external to the ear canal. Excised tissue is thus immersed in water at 60 degrees C for 2 min, yielding a sheet of epidermis with microcomedones attached. The magnitude of follicular hyperkeratosis is extracted with the stereomicroscope. Sixteen materials were evaluated by the new and old model which required histological sectioning. Agreement was excellent."
6769236	"Ultrasonography with 20 MHz frequency can be used to estimate tumour thickness preoperatively in malignant melanoma (MM) of the skin. The vertical invasion depth is the single most important prognostic factor for localised MM, and its preoperative knowledge would be very useful for the planning of surgical procedures. Since ultrasonographic distance measurements directly depend upon the tissue specific ultrasound velocity, we determined the ultrasound velocity in primary melanoma.                                                                              Ultrasound velocity was calculated from runtime differences of a 20 MHz ultrasound signal along a known distance either through water alone or through thick specimens of primary MM. The ultrasound velocities varied between 1553 m/s and 1588 m/s with a mean of 1564 m/s in four different MM specimens. The analysis of different parts of the specimens showed that the variation of the calculated velocities was larger between different specimens than within one individual specimen.                                                                                      The ultrasound velocity in MM tissue may be slightly lower than normally assumed, thereby explaining a part of the overestimation usually found in sonographic measurement of melanoma invasion depth. Additionally, the variation of ultrasound velocity between individual tumours may contribute to the impairment of the correlation found between sonometry and Breslow's measurement of MM invasion depth. For practical reasons, a setting of 1580 m/s will be appropriate for ultrasonography of primary malignant melanoma."
7720805	"Normal human skin is remarkably resistant to infection from the large numbers of microorganisms that routinely colonize its surface. In addition to the role of skin as a mechanical barrier, it has long been recognized that skin and other epithelia can produce a range of anti-microbial chemicals that play an important part in eliminating potential cutaneous pathogens. Anti-microbial peptides are an important evolutionarily conserved innate host defense mechanism in many organisms. Human beta defensin-1 and -2 are cysteine-rich, cationic, low molecular weight anti-microbial peptides that have recently been shown to be expressed in epithelial tissues. In this study, we describe the characterization of human beta defensin-1 and -2 mRNA and peptide expression in normal human skin. Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction we demonstrate that human beta defensin-1 is consistently expressed in skin samples from various body sites. Human beta defensin-2 demonstrates expression that is more variable and is more readily detectable in facial skin and foreskin compared with skin from abdomen and breast. In situ hybridization localizes the human beta defensin-1 and -2 transcripts to keratinocytes within interfollicular skin. Using specific antibodies, we have shown that human beta defensin-1 and -2 peptides are localized to the Malpighian layer of the epidermis and/or stratum corneum and that there are interindividual and site-specific differences in intensity of immunostaining and the pattern of peptide localization. The localization of human beta defensins to the outer layer of the skin is consistent with the hypothesis that human beta defensins play an essential part in cutaneous innate immunity."
6739995	"The signal transduction pathway of the plant stress and defense hormone, ethylene, has been extensively elucidated using the plant genetic model Arabidopsis over the last two decades. Among others, a MAPKKK CTR1 was identified as a negative regulator that has led to the speculation of MAPK involvement in ethylene signaling. However, it remained unclear how the MAPK modules acting downstream of the receptors to mediate ethylene signaling. We have recently presented new evidence that the MKK9-MPK3/6 modules identified by combined functional genomic and genetic screens mediate ethylene signaling, which is negatively regulated by the genetically identified CTR1-dependent cascades. Our genetic studies show consistently that the MKK9-MPK3/MPK6 modules act downstream of the ethylene receptors. Biochemical and transgenic analyses further demonstrated that the positive-acting and negative-acting MAPK activities are integrated and act simultaneously to control the key transcription factor EIN3 through dual phosphorylations to regulate the EIN3 protein stability and downstream transcription cascades. This study has revealed a novel molecular mechanism that defines the specificity of complex MAPK signaling. Comprehensive elucidation of MAPK cascades and the underlying molecular mechanisms would provide more precise explanations for how plant cells utilize MAPK cascades to control specific downstream outputs in response to distinct stimuli."
8108194	"In pediatric LDLT, graft reduction is sometimes required because of the graft size mismatch. Dividing the portal triad and hepatic veins with a linear stapler is a rapid and safe method of reduction. We herein present a case with a left lateral segment reduction achieved using a linear stapler after reperfusion in pediatric LDLT. The patient was a male who had previously undergone Kasai procedure for biliary atresia. We performed the LDLT with his father's lateral segment. According to the pre-operative volumetry, the GV/SLV ratio was 102.5%. As the patient's PV was narrow, sclerotic and thick, we decided to put an interposition with the IMV graft of the donor between the confluence and the graft PV. The graft PV was anastomosed to the IMV graft. The warm ischemic time was 34 min, and the cold ischemic time was 82 min. The ratio of the graft size to the recipient weight (G/R ratio) was 4.2%. After reperfusion, we found that the graft had poor perfusion and decided to reduce the graft size. We noted good perfusion in the residual area after the lateral edge was clamped with an intestinal clamp. The liver tissue was sufficiently fractured with an intestinal clamp and then was divided with a linear stapler. The final G/R ratio was 3.6%. The total length of the operation was 12 h and 20 min. The amount of blood lost was 430 mL. No surgical complications, including post-operative hemorrhage and bile leakage, were encountered. We believe that using the linear stapler decreased the duration of the operation and was an acceptable technique for reducing the graft after reperfusion."
5137969	"Cutaneous cryptococcosis, caused by an encapsulated yeast, Cryptococcus neoformans, is generally associated with concomitant systemic infection. Here we report a case of primary cutaneous cryptococcosis with spread to central nervous system in an HIV seronegative young boy. In the present case, a 17-year-old boy who was suffering from a non-healing ulcer on his right great toe for 5 months, presented with the signs and symptoms of meningitis. Cryptococcus neoformans var. gattii was isolated from the CSF of the patient. Amphotericin B administration produced recovery from the meningitis as well as from the ulcer. This case study suggests that primary cutaneous cryptococcosis can be diagnosed provisionally by a simple Gram stained smear and India ink examination in order to avoid occurrence of disseminated cryptococcosis, including meningial involvement, which may have a fatal outcome."
3566030	"The phytohormone ethylene regulates many aspects of plant growth, development, and environmental responses. Much of the developmental regulation of ethylene responses in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) occurs at the level of hormone sensitivity. In an effort to understand the regulation of ethylene responses, we isolated and characterized tomato genes with sequence similarity to the Arabidopsis ETR1 (ethylene response 1) ethylene receptor. Previously, we isolated three genes that exhibit high similarity to ETR1 and to each other. Here we report the isolation of two additional genes, LeETR4 and LeETR5, that are only 42% and 40% identical to ETR1, respectively. Although the amino acids known to be involved in ethylene binding are conserved, LeETR5 lacks the histidine within the kinase domain that is predicted to be phosphorylated. This suggests that histidine kinase activity is not necessary for an ethylene response, because mutated forms of both LeETR4 and LeETR5 confer dominant ethylene insensitivity in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Expression analysis indicates that LeETR4 accounts for most of the putative ethylene-receptor mRNA present in reproductive tissues, but, like LeETR5, it is less abundant in vegetative tissues. Taken together, ethylene perception in tomato is potentially quite complex, with at least five structurally divergent, putative receptor family members exhibiting significant variation in expression levels throughout development."
9510779	"Extracellular NAD is emerging as an important signal molecule in animal cells, but its role in plants has not been well-established. Although it has been shown that exogenous NAD(+) activates defense responses in Arabidopsis, components in the exogenous NAD(+)-activated defense pathway remain to be fully discovered. In a genetic screen for mutants insensitive to exogenous NAD(+) (ien), we isolated a mutant named ien2. Map-based cloning revealed that IEN2 encodes ELONGATA3 (ELO3)/AtELP3, a subunit of the Arabidopsis Elongator complex, which functions in multiple biological processes, including histone modification, DNA (de)methylation, and transfer RNA modification. Mutations in the ELO3/AtELP3 gene compromise exogenous NAD(+)-induced expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes and resistance to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola ES4326, and transgenic expression of the coding region of ELO3/AtELP3 in elo3/Atelp3 restores NAD(+) responsiveness to the mutant plants, demonstrating that ELO3/AtELP3 is required for exogenous NAD(+)-induced defense responses. Furthermore, mutations in genes encoding the other five Arabidopsis Elongator subunits (ELO2/AtELP1, AtELP2, ELO1/AtELP4, AtELP5, and AtELP6) also compromise exogenous NAD(+)-induced PR gene expression and resistance to P. syringae pv. maculicola ES4326. These results indicate that the Elongator complex functions as a whole in exogenous NAD(+)-activated defense signaling in Arabidopsis."
2508151	"Recent studies have shown ethnic differences concerning cardio-vascular disease, diabetes and mental health. Little is known about ethnic differences in skin morbidity. The purpose of this study was to describe possible ethnic differences in self-reported skin morbidity in a Western urban community.                                                                              The design was cross sectional. 40,888 adults in Oslo, Norway, received a postal questionnaire providing information on socio-demographic factors and self-reported health, including items on skin complaints.                                                                              18,770 individuals answered the questionnaire. In the sample 84% were from Norway. The largest immigrant group was from Western countries (5%) and the Indian Subcontinent (3%). Itch was the most prevalent reported skin symptom (7%), and was significantly more reported by men from East Asia (18%) and Middle East/North Africa (13%). The same observations were seen for reported dry and sore skin. Hair loss was a dominating complaint for men from the Indian Subcontinent and the Middle East/North Africa (23% and 25%) and for women from the same ethnic groups. Women from Sub-Saharan Africa reported significantly more pimples than in the other groups (17%).                                                                                     The study showed that there were significant differences in self-reported skin complaints among ethnic groups. Issues concerning the cultural value of some skin symptoms should be examined further."
6278351	"Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a connective tissue disease characterized by excessive extracellular matrix deposition in the skin and visceral organs with an autoimmune background. Although the pathogenic relationship between systemic autoimmunity and the clinical manifestations remains unknown, SSc patients have immunological abnormalities including the production of disease-specific autoantibodies. Recent studies have demonstrated that B cells play a crucial role in systemic autoimmunity and disease expression via various functions in addition to autoantibody production. Recent studies show that B cells from SSc patients demonstrate an upregulated CD19 signaling pathway, which is a crucial regulator of B-cell activation, that induces SSc-specific autoantibody production in SSc. In addition, B cells from SSc patients exhibit an overexpression of CD19. Consistently, in CD19 transgenic mice, CD19 overexpression induces SSc-specific autoantibody production. SSc patients have also intrinsic B-cell abnormalities characterized by chronic hyperreactivity of memory B cells, possibly due to CD19 overexpression. Similarly, B cells from a tight-skin mouse, a genetic model of SSc, show augmented CD19 signaling and chronic hyperreactivity. Furthermore, in bleomycin-induced SSc model mice, endogenous ligands for Toll-like receptors, induced by bleomycin treatment, stimulate B cells to produce various fibrogenic cytokines and autoantibodies. Remarkably, CD19 loss results in inhibition of B-cell hyperreactivity and elimination of autoantibody production, which is associated with improvement of fibrosis. Taken together, altered B-cell function may result in tissue fibrosis, as well as autoimmunity, in SSc. Although further studies and greater understanding are needed, B cells are potential therapeutic target in SSc."
3683093	"Cutaneous wound healing is a well-coordinated process that includes inflammation, proliferation, and differentiation. Activator protein 1 (AP-1) subunits have been implicated in the regulation of genes important for these processes and have been shown to be involved in wound healing. However, investigation of human healing and non-healing wounds in vivo and ex vivo, and the comparative analysis of several members of the Jun and Fos families are still missing. Here, we show that normal human epidermal wound healing is biphasic. In the first phase all AP-1 subunits investigated, that is c-Jun, Jun B, Jun D, c-Fos, and Fos B are absent from the nuclei at the wound margins/leading edges. This downregulation coincides with that of the gap junction protein connexin 43. Later on, c-Jun, Jun B, Jun D, and c-Fos reappear in the nuclei of the leading edges in a time-dependent manner. In non-healing wounds, a more intensive staining of keratinocytes at the wound margins is often observed. Our findings suggest that coordinated down- and upregulation of the various AP-1 subunits in the course of epidermal wound healing is important for its undisturbed progress, putatively by influencing inflammation and cell-cell communication."

Cutaneous ulcerative lichen planus is usually found on the palmar or plantar surfaces and has only rarely been described elsewhere. We describe a case of cutaneous ulcerative lichen planus involving the pretibia and exhibiting pathergy, which to our knowledge has not been previously reported. We also describe successful treatment with oral acitretin in conjunction with topical and intralesional corticosteroids."
5727820	"A unique monoclonal antibody was obtained by immunizing mice with complement-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS). This antibody, named SI-1, stained epidermal basal cells of humans, pig, guinea pig, and rat by an indirect immunofluorescence technique after pretreatment of cryostat sections with alkali buffer (pH 9.6). After dissociating pig epidermal cells by trypsin, the SI-1 antibody stained exclusively and strongly one type of uniquely shaped cells. They were small and hanging-bell or columnar in shape with one convoluted side on the base, consisting of less than 2.8% of the dissociated epidermal cell population. The antigen contained in FBS was partially purified by affinity chromatography using the SI-1 antibody. The affinity-purified antigen inhibited the spreading of PAM cells, a spontaneously transformed murine keratinocyte line, in serum-free medium in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations of 10(-5) to 10 ng/ml. The antigen also inhibited the spreading of trypsinized pig epidermal cells in the range of 10(-2) to 10(3) ng/ml in the presence of 0.05% FBS. Although there have been a few reports indicating that serum inhibited both spreading and attachment, a specific factor in serum has not been purified before. This is, to our knowledge, the first presentation of a cell-spreading inhibitor contained in serum."
1693720	"Gene-for-gene (GFG) and matching-allele (MA) models are qualitatively different paradigms for describing the outcome of genetic interactions between hosts and pathogens. The GFG paradigm was largely built on the foundations of Flor's early work on the flax-flax rust interaction and is based on the concept of genetic recognition leading to incompatible disease outcomes, typical of host immune recognition. In contrast, the MA model is based on the assumption that genetic recognition leads to compatible interactions, which can result when pathogens require specific host factors to cause infection. Results from classical MA and GFG models have led to important predictions regarding various coevolutionary phenomena, including the role of fitness costs associated with resistance and infectivity, the distribution of resistance genes in wild populations, patterns of local adaptation and the evolution and maintenance of sexual reproduction. Empirical evidence (which we review briefly here), particularly from recent molecular advances in understanding of the mechanisms that determine the outcome of host-pathogen encounters, suggests considerable variation in specific details of the functioning of interactions between hosts and pathogens, which may contain elements of both models. In this regard, GFG and MA scenarios likely represent endpoints of a continuum of potentially more complex interactions that occur in nature. Increasingly, this has been recognized in theoretical studies of coevolutionary processes in plant host-pathogen and animal host-parasite associations (e.g., departures from strict GFG/MA assumptions, diploid genetics, multi-step infection processes). However, few studies have explored how different genetic assumptions about host resistance and pathogen infectivity might impact on disease epidemiology or pathogen persistence within and among populations. Here, we use spatially explicit simulations of the basic MA and GFG scenarios to highlight qualitative differences between these scenarios with regard to patterns of disease and impacts on host demography. Given that such impacts drive evolutionary trajectories, future theoretical advances that aim to capture more complex genetic scenarios should explicitly address the interaction between epidemiology and different models of host-pathogen interaction genetics."

In 2014, 9252 eligible deaths were reported by organ procurement organizations, a slight increase from 8944 in 2012, and the donation/conversation rate was 73.4 eligible donors per 100 eligible deaths, a slight increase from 71.3 in 2013. Some metrics show variation across organ procurement organizations, suggesting that sharing best practices could lead to gains in efficiency and organ retrieval."
1245103	"Pseudomonas fluorescens B16 is a plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium. To determine the factors involved in plant growth promotion by this organism, we mutagenized wild-type strain B16 using OmegaKm elements and isolated one mutant, K818, which is defective in plant growth promotion, in a rockwool culture system. A cosmid clone, pOK40, which complements the mutant K818, was isolated from a genomic library of the parent strain. Tn3-gusA mutagenesis of pOK40 revealed that the genes responsible for plant growth promotion reside in a 13.3-kb BamHI fragment. Analysis of the DNA sequence of the fragment identified 11 putative open reading frames, consisting of seven known and four previously unidentified pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) biosynthetic genes. All of the pqq genes showed expression only in nutrient-limiting conditions in a PqqH-dependent manner. Electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry analysis of culture filtrates confirmed that wild-type B16 produces PQQ, whereas mutants defective in plant growth promotion do not. Application of wild-type B16 on tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants cultivated in a hydroponic culture system significantly increased the height, flower number, fruit number, and total fruit weight, whereas none of the strains that did not produce PQQ promoted tomato growth. Furthermore, 5 to 1,000 nm of synthetic PQQ conferred a significant increase in the fresh weight of cucumber (Cucumis sativus) seedlings, confirming that PQQ is a plant growth promotion factor. Treatment of cucumber leaf discs with PQQ and wild-type B16 resulted in the scavenging of reactive oxygen species and hydrogen peroxide, suggesting that PQQ acts as an antioxidant in plants."
4767741	"Recombinant human stem-cell factor (SCF), a cytokine acting on hematopoietic progenitor cells, has potential for the treatment of several hematologic and oncologic disorders. In a hematology-oncology phase I trial of SCF, several patients had cutaneous hyperpigmentation at the SCF subcutaneous injection sites.                                                                                  Our purpose was to investigate the pathogenesis of this hyperpigmentation phenomenon.                                                                              Skin biopsy specimens were obtained before, at the completion of, and after SCF therapy and were processed for histology, immunohistology, and electron microscopy.                                                                              Skin at the site of SCF injection had an increased number of melanocytes, increased melanocytic dendrite extension, and melanin as compared with noninjected tissue. Immunohistochemical stains revealed an increase in staining with melanocyte-specific monoclonal antibodies HMB-45 and NKI/beteb, and a monoclonal antibody to the receptor for SCF, c-kit.                                                                                     Subcutaneous injection of SCF results in hyperplasia of melanocytes. SCF may be useful in the treatment of melanocytopenic disorders, but caution may be necessary in patients with disorders of melanocyte proliferation."
6823100	"We have previously shown that a delayed graft function (DGF) longer than 6 days was a crucial threshold for long-term graft outcome. The aim of this study was to analyze the correlation of DGF >   or=6 days with brain-dead donor variables, including those related to resuscitation, in a population of 262 consecutive brain-dead donors from 1990 to 2003.                                                                              We used a marginal logistic model in which DGF was considered as a binary variable with a cutoff of 6 days.                                                                              Monovariate analysis of donor parameters showed that male, age above 35 years, primary history of hypertension, hydroxyethyl starch (HES) fluid greater than 1500 mL or epinephrine infusion during resuscitation were risk factors for prolonged DGF. The multivariate logistic regression model showed that epinephrine use during donor resuscitation (P<   0.001, odds ratio [OR]=4.35), cold ischemia time (CIT) >   or=16 hr (P=0.01, OR=2.16), and recipient age >   55 years (P=0.003, OR=2.75), were associated with a risk of prolonged DGF. A long stay (>   40 hr) in intensive care and a large volume of colloids (>   1250 mL, except HES) correlated with a lower risk of DGF.                                                                                     Our study shows an impact for only a limited number of brain dead donor resuscitation parameters on DGF duration. We also show that CIT has a much lower threshold (<   16 hr) for DGF risk than previously described. Importantly, we show that recipient age is clearly a major independent risk factor for prolonged DGF, whereas donor age seems to act mostly as a dependent risk factor."

Evidence gathered from a pivotal study involving 1,383 patients with 1,831-pigmented lesions. The isolated use of the pediatric population within this study was used to determine the specificity and sensitivity of such a device with comparison to a dermatologists evaluation.                                                                               For all lesions from the assessed pediatric population the biopsy ratio was equivalent for the Multispectral Digital Skin Lesion Analysis device as for the dermatologists when performing as independent reviewers. Furthermore analyzed data suggests that dermatologists who incorporate the Multispectral Digital Skin Lesion Analysis device perform better than they would independently or if they were to follow the device blindly without incorporating their own judgment.                                                                                                   An approach that integrates automated imaging technology like the Multispectral Digital Skin Lesion Analysis device, along with another diagnostic aid, with the end result being cost-effective, easy to use by even non-experts and comforting for the pediatric patient is likely to compete to be the new gold standard in successful early diagnosis and management of melanoma."

6731753	"A 21-year-old female underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) from her HLA matched brother for chronic myeloid leukaemia in the chronic phase. Four weeks post transplant she developed tenesmus, mucoid stool mixed with blood and lower abdominal pain. This rapidly progressed to greenish watery diarrhoea with flakes of mucous membrane floating in it, conforming to the classical clinical description of acute GVHD of the bowel. Stool microscopy showed profuse numbers of Blastocystis hominis, a parasite with doubtful pathogenicity in an immunocompetent host. In the present case the parasite played a pathogenic role as evidenced by the profuse number in the stool sample, focal neutrophil infiltration of the rectal mucosa, initial presentation of the patient with dysentery, and requirement for prolonged metronidazole therapy to eradicate the parasite and cure the diarrhoea. She also had grade I GVHD of the liver and skin. In developing tropical countries, hitherto unreported parasitic infestations may complicate the picture of acute GVHD."

Patients with this autosomal recessive condition have characteristic facial features, microcephaly present at birth, immunodeficiency, predisposition to malignancy, ionizing radiation hypersensitivity, and growth retardation. We report a 12-year-old boy with NBS associated with porokeratosis; to our knowledge this association has not previously been reported."
7183073	"Cold stress, which causes dehydration damage to the plant cell, is one of the most common abiotic stresses that adversely affect plant growth and crop productivity. To improve its cold-tolerance, plants often enhance expression of some cold-related genes. In this study, a cold-regulated gene encoding 25 KDa of protein was isolated from Brassica napus cDNA library using a macroarray analysis, and is consequently designated as BnCOR25. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that BnCOR25 was expressed at high levels in hypocotyls, cotyledons, stems, and flowers, but its mRNA was found at low levels in roots and leaves. Northern blot analysis revealed that BnCOR25 transcripts were significantly induced by cold and osmotic stress treatment. The data also showed that BnCOR25 gene expression is mediated by ABA-dependent pathway. Overexpression of BnCOR25 in yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) significantly enhanced the cell survival probability under cold stress, and overexpression of BnCOR25 in Arabidopsis enhances plant tolerance to cold stress. These results suggested that the BnCOR25 gene may play an important role in conferring freezing/cold tolerance in plants."
8035502	"The effect of a hypoxic pre-treatment (HPT) on improving tolerance to prolonged anoxia conditions in two contrasting Vitis species (V. riparia, anoxia tolerant; V. rupestris, anoxia sensitive) was evaluated. The energy economy of root cells was studied by measuring heat production, the activity of pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) and alcohol dehdrogenase (ADH), ethanol and ATP production, and K(+) fluxes. The results showed that HPT is an effective tool in order to maintain a sustainable metabolic performance in both the species under anoxia conditions, especially in sensitive species such as V. rupestris. Our results showed that the improved tolerance was mainly driven by: (i) an enhanced activity of key enzymes in alcohol fermentation (ADC and PDC); (ii) the capability to maintain a higher level of respiration, evidenced by a lesser decrease in heat development and ATP production; and (iii) the maintenance of a better ion homeostasis (highlighted by measurement of K(+) fluxes) and K(+) channel functionality."
9624647	"Accurate assessment of the somatic mutational status of clonal immunoglobulin variable region (IgV) genes is relevant in elucidating tumour cell origin in B-cell lymphoma; virgin B cells bear unmutated IgV genes, while germinal centre and postfollicular B cells carry mutated IgV genes. Furthermore, biases in the IgV repertoire and distribution pattern of somatic mutations indicate a possible antigen role in the pathogenesis of B-cell malignancies.                                                                                   This work investigates the cellular origin and antigenic selection in primary cutaneous B-cell lymphoma (PCBCL).                                                                              We analysed the nucleotide sequence of clonal IgV heavy-chain gene (IgVH) rearrangements in 51 cases of PCBCL (25 follicle centre, 19 marginal zone and seven diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leg-type) and compared IgVH sequences with their closest germline segment in the GenBank database. Molecular data were then correlated with histopathological features.                                                                              We showed that all but one of the 51 IgVH sequences analysed exhibited extensive somatic hypermutations. The detected mutation rate ranged from 1.6% to 21%, with a median rate of 9.8% and was independent of PCBCL histotype. Calculation of antigen-selection pressure showed that 39% of the mutated IgVH genes displayed a number of replacement mutations and silent mutations in a pattern consistent with antigenic selection. Furthermore, two segments, VH1-69 (12%) and VH4-59 (14%), were preferentially used in our case series.                                                                                      Data indicate that neoplastic B cells of PBCBL have experienced germinal centre reaction and also suggest that the involvement of IgVH genes is not entirely random in PCBCL and that common antigen epitopes could be pathologically relevant in cutaneous lymphomagenesis."
1333530	"Besides the six classical exanthems, other exanthems may occur, differing in morphology and causative agent (atypical exanthems). Their aetiological diagnosis is difficult but crucial for both the patient and community concerning issues such as time off school, immunizations, and risks for pregnant women and immunocompromised patients.                                                                                   To investigate whether morphology, associated symptoms and laboratory results can help to determine the aetiology of atypical exanthems.                                                                              We studied 112 consecutive out-patients attending two university dermatology departments. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and throat, rectal and vaginal swabs were studied to identify viral and bacterial growth. Nested polymerase chain reaction was performed on PBMC and plasma using specific primers for herpesviruses. Serology for common viruses was investigated.                                                                              We classified the exanthems into seven morphological patterns: macular erythema (32 patients), papular erythema (eight), maculopapular erythema (42), maculopapular erythema with petechiae (seven), erythema with vesiculation (11), erythema with pustules (five) and urticaria (seven). On the basis of morphology, in concert with the associated symptoms and laboratory results, we found a causal relationship in 76 patients (68%): 25 cases due to drugs, 32 to viruses, 16 to bacteria and three to parasites. A good correspondence between morphology and aetiology was found. The erythematous-vesicular pattern was exclusive to viral infections and was often accompanied by enanthema. The erythemato-pustular and papular patterns were found only in drug-related cases and in some undiagnosed cases. In contrast, the macular and maculopapular patterns were almost evenly distributed among the various aetiologies, although their colour was duskier in the drug-related exanthems. Severe pruritus was associated with drug-related exanthems.                                                                                      This is the largest series of consecutive patients with atypical exanthems reported. Their morphology and their association with pruritus or constitutional symptoms proved to be important diagnostic clues."
6634776	A 27-year-old woman who had been receiving propylthiouracil for 2 years for Graves' disease presented with painful ulceration on the lower limbs which had first appeared 2 weeks previously. Well-circumscribed hemorrhagic ulcerations with ragged borders were noted on both legs. Skin biopsy demonstrated a florid neutrophilic infiltrate and evidence of leukocytoclasis around small blood vessels in the papillary dermis compatible with the diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum. A highly positive perinuclear pattern of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody with specificities for IgM myeloperoxidase was observed. The authors think that propylthiouracil is associated with the occurrence of pyoderma gangrenosum in this patient.
6116279	"Force distribution on mandibular implants supporting overdentures was registered in vivo by means of piezo-electric transducers that allow for simultaneous force measurements in 3 dimensions. The anchorage device for connecting the overdenture to the implants was a U-shaped bar to which distal extensions were soldered bilaterally. Force patterns were analyzed under different test conditions such as maximum force when biting in centric occlusion, maximum biting with the unilateral use of a bite plate, parafunction and chewing bread. Maximum force measured in centric occlusion and on the ipsilateral implant with the use of bite plate was increased in the vertical dimension, compared to transverse dimensions. On the contralateral implant, equally low values were found, in all 3 dimensions. Transverse force components reached 5 to 35% of the vertical magnitudes. With the use of the bite plate on the ipsilateral implant, force magnitudes in the vertical direction and in the backward-forward direction were significantly higher (P <    0.01, P <    0.00) compared to measurements in centric occlusion. Chewing and grinding resulted in lower vertical forces compared to maximum biting, while transverse forces in the backward forward direction reached force magnitudes that resembled the vertical component (50 to 100%). The prevalent (>    95%) or exclusive force direction in the vertical dimension, registered on both implants was downward. However, with the unilateral use of the bite plate, upward directions were found on the contralateral implant as an effect of distal bar extensions. This was in contrast to previous results where upward force directions were not found. In transverse dimensions, the specific influence of bar extensions was recognised in backward directions on the contralateral implant. In comparison with previous results, it was concluded that, in vivo, the effect of distal bar extensions was of much lesser influence regarding force magnitudes and force directions than was expected."
5045580	"Wild tomato species in Solanum Section Lycopersicon often exhibit two types of reproductive barriers: self-incompatibility (SI) and unilateral incompatibility or incongruity (UI), wherein the success of an inter-specific cross depends on the direction of the cross. UI pollen rejection often follows the 'SI × SC' rule, i.e. pistils of SI species reject the pollen of SC (self-compatible) species but not vice versa, suggesting that the SI and UI pollen rejection mechanisms may overlap. In order to address this question, pollen tube growth was measured after inter-specific crosses using wild tomato species as the female parents and pollen from cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). Two modes of UI pollen rejection, early and late, were observed, and both differed from SI pollen rejection. The structure and expression of known stylar SI genes were evaluated. We found that S-RNase expression is not required for either the early or late mode of UI pollen rejection. However, two HT family genes, HT-A and HT-B, map to a UI QTL. Surprisingly, we found that a gene previously implicated in SI, HT-B, is mutated in both SI and SC S. habrochaites accessions, and no HT-B protein could be detected. HT-A genes were detected and expressed in all species examined, and may therefore function in both SI and UI. We conclude that there are significant differences between SI and UI in the tomato clade, in that pollen tube growth differs between these two rejection systems, and some stylar SI factors, including S-RNase and HT-B, are not required for UI."

ADA activity was determined with an enzymatic method in 34 patients with PSS, 4 with mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), 6 with dermatomyositis (DM), 11 with localized scleroderma (LS), and 13 with other collagen diseases.                                                                              Serum ADA activity was elevated over the mean (+2 standard deviations) of the control in 85% of the patients with PSS, all with MCTD, 83% of those with DM, and 82% of those with LS. The mean values in 10 PSS patients with anti-topoisomerase I antibodies, 14 patients with anti-RNP antibodies, 12 patients with anticentromere antibodies (ACAs), and 5 patients without antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) were 26.1, 24.9, 22.6, and 16.8 IU/L, respectively. In most cases, except for ACA-positive patients, serum ADA activity changed almost in parallel with ANA titers.                                                                                     These results support the notion that T cells are involved in the pathogenesis of PSS and related disorders."
6819382	"Exudation of benzoxazinoid metabolites from roots of young maize seedlings recruits the rhizobacterial strain Pseudomonas putida KT2440 from the soil to the rhizosphere. In this study, we have investigated whether these rhizobacteria are beneficial for maize by eliciting systemic defense priming. Root colonization of the maize hybrid cultivar Delprim by P. putida primed wound- and jasmonic acid (JA)-inducible emission of aromatic and terpenoid volatiles, but not the emission of the green leaf volatile (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate. Furthermore, root colonization by P. putida primed stress-inducible transcription of the JA-dependent gene SerPIN, whereas JA-dependent induction of the MPI gene was unaffected. Systemic priming of SerPIN by P. putida only occurred in benzoxazinoid-producing plants, and was absent in benzoxazinoid-deficient plants. The results from this study suggest that root colonization by P. putida primes a selection of JA-dependent defenses in Maize, which is reliant on benzoxazinoid exudation from the roots."
7970609	"Chronic allergic skin disorders are the inflammatory and proliferative conditions in which both genetic and environmental factors play important roles. Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) and atopic dermatitis (AD) are among the most common chronic allergic skin disorders. These can be provoked by various food and aeroallergens. Skin prick tests (SPTs) represent the cheapest and most effective method to diagnose type I hypersensitivity. Positive skin tests with a history suggestive of clinical sensitivity strongly incriminate the allergen as a contributor to the disease process.                                                                                            To determine the incidence of positive SPT in patients with chronic allergic skin disorders and to identify the various allergens implicated in positive SPT.                                                                              Fifty patients of chronic allergic disorders were recruited in this study. They were evaluated by SPT with both food and aeroallergens.                                                                              In our study, SPT positivity in patients of CIU was 63.41% and in AD was 77.78%. Out of the 41 patients of CIU, the most common allergen groups showing SPT positivity were dust and pollen, each comprising 26.83% patients. SPT reaction was positive with food items (21.6%), insects (17.07%), fungus (12.20%), and Dermatophagoides farinae, that is, house dust mite (HDM) (7.32%). The allergen which showed maximum positivity was grain dust wheat (19.51%). Among nine patients of AD, maximum SPT positivity was seen with Dermatophagoides farinae, pollen Amaranthus spinosus, grain dust wheat, and cotton mill dust; each comprising 22.22% of patients.                                                                                     Our study showed that a significant number of patients of CIU and AD showed sensitivity to dust, pollen, insects, Dermatophagoides farinae, and fungi on SPT. Thus, it is an important tool in the diagnosis of CIU and AD."
1193979	"Five RALF (rapid alkalinization factor)-like genes, named ScRALF1 to 5, were isolated from fertilized ovule and ovary cDNA libraries of Solanum chacoense. They showed high sequence similarities with the RALF protein sequence from Nicotiana tabacum, and exhibited the characteristic architecture of RALF polypeptides. All ScRALFs were moderately to highly expressed at some stage of fruit maturation. ScRALF1 and ScRALF3 were predominantly expressed in ovaries and larger fruits, while ScRALF2, ScRALF4, and ScRALF5 were also expressed in other tissues, indicating that while some RALFs may be involved in fruit maturation, others could be involved in other developmental processes. Wounding or treatment of plants with growth regulators involved in plant defense responses had no significant impact on the mRNA level of any of these genes. These results suggest and support previous data showing that RALF peptides are more likely to act as a small peptide involved in plant development than in defense responses."
2531167	"Gap junctions are formed by a polygenic family of more than 20 different connexin proteins. They mediate intercellular communication via the direct exchange of ions, metabolites and secondary messengers, thus controlling and coordinating cellular activities. Mutations in five gap junction genes, including GJB2 (Cx26), GJB3 (Cx31), GJB4 (Cx30.3), GJB6 (Cx30) and GJA1 (Cx43) are known to cause inherited hearing loss and/or disorders of the skin and its appendages, often giving rise to overlapping phenotypes. In this study we present a patient with hidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, who had abortive features of oculo-dento-digital dysplasia, extensive hyperkeratosis of the skin. The patient harbored a novel sporadic mutation (V41L) in GJA1 (Cx43) as well as a heterozygous coding variant (R127H) of GJB2 (Cx26). Our findings suggest that GJA1 mutations can produce variable clinical phenotypes on the background of sequence variants in other connexins."
2232741	"Callus formation and de novo organogenesis often occur in the wounded tissues of plants. Although this regenerative capacity of plant cells has been utilized for many years, molecular basis for the wound-induced acquisition of regeneration competency is yet to be elucidated. Here we find that wounding treatment is essential for shoot regeneration from roots in the conventional tissue culture of Arabidopsis thaliana. Furthermore, we show that an AP2/ERF transcription factor WOUND INDUCED DEDIFFERENTIATION1 (WIND1) plays a pivotal role for the acquisition of regeneration competency in the culture system. Ectopic expression of WIND1 can bypass both wounding and auxin pre-treatment and increase de novo shoot regeneration from root explants cultured on shoot-regeneration promoting media. In Brassica napus, activation of Arabidopsis WIND1 also greatly enhances de novo shoot regeneration, further corroborating the role of WIND1 in conferring cellular regenerative capacity. Our data also show that sequential activation of WIND1 and an embryonic regulator LEAFY COTYLEDON2 enhances generation of embryonic callus, suggesting that combining WIND1 with other transcription factors promote efficient and organ-specific regeneration. Our findings in the model plant and crop plant point to a possible way to efficiently induce callus formation and regeneration by utilizing transcription factors as a molecular switch."
2490972	"Nitrification is an important process in soil--plant systems for providing plant-available nitrate (NO(3) (-)). However, NO(3) (-) is less stable in soils compared with ammonium (NH(4) (+)) and is more easily lost through leaching, runoff or denitrification. This study tested whether biological nitrification inhibition (BNI) activity is present in the root exudates of rice (Oryza sativa) and also the extent of variation between different genotypes.                                                                                  The BNI activity of root exudates was estimated by a bioluminescence assay using a recombinant Nitrosomonas europaea strain. Afterwards, the effect of a single application of concentrated root exudates and that of exudates deposited in the rhizosphere soil was tested on BNI using soil incubation. Soil was added with (NH(4))(2)SO(4) and water to reach 60 % of the water-holding capacity and incubated at 30 °C for different periods. Amounts of NH(4) (+) and NO(3) (-) were determined using a continuous-flow auto-analyser.                                                                                        In an initial screening experiment, BNI activity in the exudates of 36 different rice genotypes was evaluated using a bioassay based on a recombinant Nitrosomonas strain. Significant genotypic variation was detected with the upland cultivar IAC25 demonstrating consistently high BNI activity, while modern lowland varieties like Nipponbare or IR64 exhibited lower activity. Subsequent experiments ruled out the possibility that BNI activity is simply due to non-specific (solute) leakage from roots. Soil incubation studies with concentrated root exudates of IAC25 showed significant reductions in NO(3) (-) formation. This effect was confirmed by detecting lower NO(3) (-) levels in incubation experiments using rhizosphere soil obtained from IAC25.                                                                                      Our results provide first evidence that root exudates of rice can reduce nitrification rates in soil. Having shown this for a model crop, rice, offers possibilities for further exploitation of this phenomenon through molecular and genetic tools."
1902086	"The genome-wide discovery and high-throughput genotyping of SNPs in chickpea natural germplasm lines is indispensable to extrapolate their natural allelic diversity, domestication, and linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns leading to the genetic enhancement of this vital legume crop. We discovered 44,844 high-quality SNPs by sequencing of 93 diverse cultivated desi, kabuli, and wild chickpea accessions using reference genome- and de novo-based GBS (genotyping-by-sequencing) assays that were physically mapped across eight chromosomes of desi and kabuli. Of these, 22,542 SNPs were structurally annotated in different coding and non-coding sequence components of genes. Genes with 3296 non-synonymous and 269 regulatory SNPs could functionally differentiate accessions based on their contrasting agronomic traits. A high experimental validation success rate (92%) and reproducibility (100%) along with strong sensitivity (93-96%) and specificity (99%) of GBS-based SNPs was observed. This infers the robustness of GBS as a high-throughput assay for rapid large-scale mining and genotyping of genome-wide SNPs in chickpea with sub-optimal use of resources. With 23,798 genome-wide SNPs, a relatively high intra-specific polymorphic potential (49.5%) and broader molecular diversity (13-89%)/functional allelic diversity (18-77%) was apparent among 93 chickpea accessions, suggesting their tremendous applicability in rapid selection of desirable diverse accessions/inter-specific hybrids in chickpea crossbred varietal improvement program. The genome-wide SNPs revealed complex admixed domestication pattern, extensive LD estimates (0.54-0.68) and extended LD decay (400-500 kb) in a structured population inclusive of 93 accessions. These findings reflect the utility of our identified SNPs for subsequent genome-wide association study (GWAS) and selective sweep-based domestication trait dissection analysis to identify potential genomic loci (gene-associated targets) specifically regulating important complex quantitative agronomic traits in chickpea. The numerous informative genome-wide SNPs, natural allelic diversity-led domestication pattern, and LD-based information generated in our study have got multidimensional applicability with respect to chickpea genomics-assisted breeding."
8449994	"5-alpha-reductase is involved as a rate-imitating enzyme in the metabolism of steroids. Several 5-alpha-reduced steroids such as dihydrotestosterone, allopregnanolone or tetrahydrocorticosterone have neurotrophic, neuroprotective, and anxiolytic properties. Reduced 5-alpha-reductase activity has been observed during depressive illness in humans. Finasteride inhibits 5-alpha-reductase and can robustly induce anxious and depressive behaviors in rodents. In humans finasteride treatment has been linked to an increase of depressive symptoms. A recent study reported that finasteride treatment inhibits hippocampal neurogenesis in mice. As hippocampal neurogenesis has been linked to emotional behavior, this could be of possible relevance for the pathophysiology of affective disorders. Further studies are needed to evaluate potential neuropsychiatric side effects of finasteride treatment in humans."
5508493	"Equestrian cold panniculitis has been described since 1980 in horse riders or in stable employees. Histological aspect is underdescribed.                                                                                           We describe clinical and histological features of six horse riding or stable employees patients presenting with upper lateral thigh lesions during the winter months between 2014 and 2016 in our dermatological department.                                                                              Six horse riding or stable employees ladies without any known disease presented with similar symptoms. They had urticarial or violaceous, slightly pruritic, sometimes necrotic lesions of the upper lateral thighs. Clinically, equestrian cold panniculitis, insect bite or a caustic dermatitis was suspected. Four of these patients had a cutaneous biopsy. They all showed a similar histological appearance resembling lupus erythematosus, combining dermo-epidermal lesions, with foci of interface dermatitis, an abundant dermal lymphocytic infiltrate and a dermal mucinosis. Hypodermal infiltration was present on samples including subcutis. Laboratory workup for systemic disease was unremarkable for two patients and not performed for the four others, having no other clinical sign of lupus. All patients improved rapidly with very high potent topical steroids.                                                                                     Cold-associated perniosis of the thighs should be considered whenever a histopathological appearance of lupus is associated with lesions of the upper lateral thighs in patients practicing horse riding. This disease belongs to the spectrum of miscellaneous cold-induced dermatoses in which histopathological lesions identical to lupus can be encountered."
8814792	"In a consecutive series of 1,067 patients entered into the data base of the Melanoma Cooperative Group at New York University School of Medicine between 1972 and 1980, 120 men were of draft age (18-31 years) during World War II (1941-1945). Questionnaires were sent to these 120 individuals; 89 responded. Simultaneously, a control (nonmelanoma) population of 65 men of similar age was queried. Each subject in both groups was asked whether he had served in the armed forces during World War II and, if so, what were his theaters of operation. Based on the response, 83% (74 of 89) of the melanoma group compared with 76% (49 of 65) of the control group had served in the armed forces during World War II; however, a significantly (p = 0.0002) greater percent of the melanoma patients (34%) served in the tropics than did the control subjects (6%). Further, overrepresented in the melanoma group that served in the tropics (compared with the melanoma group who served in the armed forces in nontropical theaters) were malignant melanomas that had their origin in nevocytic nevi. The findings suggest that Caucasian individuals heavily exposed to sunlight in the tropics for several years during early life may be at higher risk to the subsequent development of cutaneous malignant melanoma. In some individuals this may be a two-step phenomenon, in which the first step is the solar induction of nevocytic nevi and the second is malignant transformation within them."
2031311	"The aetiological and clinical associations of collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (cFSGS) following kidney transplantation (KTx) are poorly described. In this study, post-transplant cFSGS and non-collapsing FSGS (ncFSGS) were compared in recent KTx recipients. Evidence for intragraft viral infection was sought.                                                                              Twenty-nine cases of post-KTx FSGS were identified and classified as cFSGS (n = 10) or ncFSGS (n = 19). Biopsies were scored using Banff '97 criteria and subjected to in situ hybridization (ISH) for parvovirus B19 (pvB19), simian virus 40 (SV40) and BK virus (BKV).                                                                              cFSGS and ncFSGS patients were comparable for age, gender, weight, delayed function, human leucocyte antigen (HLA) matching, acute rejection and median time to diagnosis. Deceased donor source was more common among cFSGS cases (70 vs 32%, P = 0.05). FSGS was recurrent in 2/10 cFSGS cases compared with 8/19 ncFSGS (P = NS). cFSGS was associated with more proteinuria (11.9 vs 7.2 g/day, P = 0.05) and higher serum creatinine (4.2 vs 1.9 mg/dl, P = 0.0001) at diagnosis. Plasmapheresis was used in two out of 10 cFSGS and seven out of 19 ncFSGS cases with treatment response in 0 of two and three of seven, respectively. Graft loss was more rapid with cFSGS compared with ncFSGS (P = 0.02). Histologically, cFSGS was associated with more severe chronic vascular abnormalities. All biopsies were negative for pvB19, SV40 and BKV by ISH.                                                                                      cFSGS following KTx presents with higher proteinuria, diminished renal function, more severe vascular disease and higher rate of graft loss compared with the non-collapsing form. There was no evidence for infection by pvB19 or polyomaviruses."

Ischemia was induced in the rat liver by clamping the common hepatic artery and portal vein for 40 minutes, after which flow was restored, and the liver reperfused for 90 minutes. Blood samples were collected prior to ischemia and after reperfusion. cTNI as well as levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), hydroxyl radical (.OH), nitric oxide (NO), and alanine transferase (ALT) were measured.

3138931	"Sebum plays a key role in the initiation of the acne lesions. Oxidized sebum lipids cause keratynocytes hyperproliferation and inflammatory cytokines release. Association between sebum oxidation and comedogenesis has been little investigated in comedonal acne.                                                                                   Evaluation of sebum oxidation parameters and levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1α) in patients with mild comedonal acne (MCA) before and after the treatment with a mixed RetinSphere® - vitamin E formulation.                                                                              Sebum excretion rate (SER), squalene concentration, and oxidation degree of sebum were measured in 18 MCA patients and 10 controls. IL-1α levels in the stratum corneum were measured in both lesional and non-lesional facial areas of MCA patients. Sebum parameters and IL-1α were measured at week 4 of topical treatment. Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) was performed in a subset of four patients at the baseline and at week 4 and all patients were assessed clinically before and following the 8 week-treatment.                                                                              Sebum excretion rate and squalene concentration were comparable between MCA patients and healthy controls. Lipid peroxidation (LPO) and the percentage of oxidized squalene (SQOX) were significantly elevated in the sebum of MCA patients. The concentration of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1α in stratum corneum was significantly higher in the lesional area compared with non-lesional area of the MCA patients at the baseline. At week 4, while SER and squalene concentration did not vary significantly, the LPO levels and the SQOX percentage resulted decreased at a significant extent. Following the treatment, IL-1α concentration in the lesional area reached values comparable to those of unaffected areas. Consistent with the biochemical data, RCM showed the reduction of hyperkeratinization and of inflammatory cells infiltration of the adnexal structures epithelium, significant clinical improvement was recorded at week 8.

7785814	"Abscission, or organ separation, is accompanied by a marked increase in hydrolases, which are responsible for the degradation of the middle lamella and the loosening of the primary cell wall surrounding cells in the separation layer. We recently reported on the cloning of a tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) polygalacturonase (PG) cDNA, TAPG1, expressed during leaf and flower abscission. In addition to TAPG1, we have cloned two more PG cDNAs (TAPG2 and TAPG4) that are also expressed during leaf and flower abscission. The peptide sequences for the three abscission PGs are relatively similar (76-93% identity) yet different from the those of tomato fruit PG (38-41% identity). None of the three abscission PG mRNAs are expressed in fruit, stems, petioles, or anthers of fully open flowers. An RNase protection assay revealed that all three PGs are expressed in leaf and flower abscission zones and in pistils of fully open flowers.

The risk of acquiring severe travel-related illness is higher in immunocompromised subjects, such as patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or solid organ transplant recipients. We reported the first case, to our knowledge, of CHIKV infection in an HIV-infected kidney transplant recipient."
4323258	"Generalized vitiligo is the most common pigmentation disorder, the result of autoimmune loss of melanocytes from the skin and hair, with a high frequency of other autoimmune diseases in vitiligo patients and their relatives. We previously reported the linkage signals on chromosomes 1, 7, and 17 in Caucasian families with generalized vitiligo and associated autoimmune diseases and identified the risk loci of chromosomes 17 and 1 as NLRP1 (NALP1) and FOXD3, respectively. Here, we describe fine-scale genetic association analyses in two independent series of Caucasian multiplex families, refining localization of the chromosome 7 locus and a locus on chromosome 9. Three susceptibility signals, represented by single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs6960920 in 7p13, rs734930 in 7q11, and rs4744411 in 9q22, were significantly associated with vitiligo and other autoimmune diseases. We also detected significant three-way interaction effects of chromosome 7 SNP rs6960920, chromosome 9 SNP rs4744411, and NLRP1 SNP rs6502867 on both the vitiligo phenotype and an expanded autoimmune disease phenotype, and significant three-way interaction effects of both chromosome 7 SNPs and NLRP1 SNP rs6502867 on the vitiligo phenotype. These support the validity of the chromosomes 7 and 9 linkage/association signals and underscore the utility of gene-gene interaction analysis in characterizing the genetic effects of candidate association signals."
8894226	"Arid regions of the world occupy up to 35% of the earth's surface, the basis of various definitions of climatic conditions, vegetation types or potential for food production. Due to their high ecological value, monitoring of arid regions is necessary and modern vegetation studies can help in the conservation and management of these areas. The use of remote sensing for mapping of desert vegetation is difficult due to mixing of the spectral reflectance of bright desert soils with the weak spectral response of sparse vegetation. We studied the vegetation types in the semiarid to arid region of Mond Protected Area, south-west Iran, based on unsupervised classification of the Spot XS bands and then produced updated maps. Sixteen map units covering 12 vegetation types were recognized in the area based on both field works and satellite mapping. Halocnemum strobilaceum and Suaeda fruticosa vegetation types were the dominant types and Ephedra foliata, Salicornia europaea-Suaeda heterophylla vegetation types were the smallest. Vegetation coverage decreased sharply with the increase in salinity towards the coastal areas of the Persian Gulf. The highest vegetation coverage belonged to the riparian vegetation along the Mond River, which represents the northern boundary of the protected area. The location of vegetation types was studied on the separate soil and habitat diversity maps of the study area, which helped in final refinements of the vegetation map produced."
2550102	"Membrane lipids of the fad6 (formerly fadC) mutant of Arabidopsis, which is deficient in chloroplast omega 6 desaturase activity, have increased levels of monounsaturated fatty acids and are deficient in trienoic fatty acids. A putative fad6 cDNA clone was isolated by probing a cDNA library with a degenerate oligonucleotide based on a conserved region within known omega 3 desaturase genes. Expression of the cDNA in transgenic plants of a fad6 mutant restored normal levels of all fatty acids. When used as a hybridization probe, the cDNA identified a restriction fragment-length polymorphism that co-segregated with the fad6 mutation. Thus, on the basis of a genetic complementation test and genetic map position, the fad6 gene is encoded by the cDNA. The cDNA encoded a 418-amino acid polypeptide of 47,727 D that displayed a high degree of sequence similarity to a delta 12 desaturase from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis. The fad6 gene exhibited less sequence homology to any known higher plant desaturase, including an endoplasmic reticulum-localized omega 6 desaturase corresponding to the Arabidopsis fad2 gene."
3891554	"A 73-year-old male patient admitted with erythroderma was diagnosed to have primary systemic Analpastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) positive, CD 30 positive, anaplastic large cell lymphoma. The patient's condition deteriorated rapidly during the period after the diagnosis was confirmed, with subsequent death before chemotherapy could be started. He had been started on carbamazepine, for diabetic neuropathy three months prior to the development of the skin lesions. Here we highlight the possibility of carbamazepine inducing anaplastic large cell lymphomas and the need for a high level of suspicion to make an early diagnosis allowing rapid appropriate treatment in such cases."
1674956	"Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune and increasingly prevalent condition caused by immunological destruction of beta cells. Insulin remains the mainstay of therapy. Endeavours in islet transplantation have clearly demonstrated that type 1 diabetes is treatable by cellular replacement. Many challenges remain with this approach. The opportunity to use bioengineered embryonic or adult pluripotential stem cells, or islets derived from porcine xenograft sources could address future demands, but are still associated with considerable challenges. This detailed review outlines current progress in clinical islet transplantation, and places this in perspective for the remarkable scientific advances now occurring in stem cell and regenerative medicine approaches in the treatment of future curative treatment of diabetes."
3909349	"Twenty-six patients with a history of hospitalization for severe psoriasis were evaluated with regard to their use of inpatient therapy before and during therapy with etretinate. The duration of the pretherapy period and the etretinate treatment period averaged 5 and 4 years, respectively. Use of etretinate nearly eliminated inpatient therapy among these patients. Twelve of the patients stopped etretinate; their use of hospitalization for psoriasis remained below pre-etretinate levels in the two years after etretinate therapy was stopped. Etretinate therapy represents an effective and economical alternative to hospitalization for psoriasis treatment."
5331275	"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors have been reported to induce numerous cutaneous side effects, the most notable of which is a papulopustular eruption on the face, scalp, and central chest. The typical presentation consists of inflamed papules, often with pustules, favoring a seborrheic distribution. The pustules of the EGFR inhibitor-induced papulopustular eruption are commonly sterile but bacterial superinfection is not uncommon. We report two unique presentations of the papulopustular eruption that were found to be associated with Staphylococcus aureus superinfection. One patient presented with an abrupt onset of nearly confluent red plaques on the cheeks, forehead, chin, and neck, with innumerable studded pinpoint pustules. The other patient had a long-standing untreated papulopustular eruption on the scalp, which resulted in widespread erythema, large thick plaques of serous crust, pustular exudate, and associated alopecia. Both patients quickly resolved with non-tetracycline oral antibiotics combined with topical steroid treatment."
9392932	"Hymenoptera venom anaphylaxis is a frightening event that affects physical and psychical functioning.                                                                                           Retrospective survey of 182 Hymenoptera venom allergic patients living in a rural area using a questionnaire targeting on patients' satisfaction during therapy, fear of anaphylactic recurrences and changes in lifestyle before and after venom immunotherapy (VIT). Additionally, patients' self-assessment of quality of life, daily outdoor time and re-sting rate were recorded.                                                                              146 patients returned the questionnaire (58.9% male, 41.1% female, 25.3% honey bee allergic, 67.8% wasp allergic, 41.1% re-sting rate, mean follow-up time 6.5 years). Measurement of the parameters fear, satisfaction and changes in lifestyle revealed a significant improvement after VIT. This correlated with the patients'self-assessment of quality of life,when 89.7% declared an improvement after VIT. Although the improvement was higher in patients with re-stings, also patients without re-stings clearly benefited from VIT. Interestingly, females were significantly more affected by Hymenoptera venom allergy than males,whereas both genders showed a similar improvement after VIT.                                                                                      Patients with Hymenoptera venom sting allergy significantly benefit from VIT in regard to both biological and psychological outcome. VIT should still be provided to all Hymenoptera venom allergic patients as standard of care."
9598728	"Fructan 1-exohydrolase, an enzyme involved in fructan degradation, belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase family 32. The structure of isoenzyme 1-FEH IIa from Cichorium intybus is described at a resolution of 2.35 A. The structure consists of an N-terminal fivefold beta-propeller domain connected to two C-terminal beta-sheets. The putative active site is located entirely in the beta-propeller domain and is formed by amino acids which are highly conserved within glycosyl hydrolase family 32. The fructan-binding site is thought to be in the cleft formed between the two domains. The 1-FEH IIa structure is compared with the structures of two homologous but functionally different enzymes: a levansucrase from Bacillus subtilis (glycosyl hydrolase family 68) and an invertase from Thermotoga maritima (glycosyl hydrolase family 32)."
1181522	"Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an autoimmune disease that is linked to gluten sensitivity and has a clear relationship to celiac disease. Both conditions are mediated by the IgA class of autoantibodies and the diagnosis of DH is dependent on detection of granular deposits of IgA in the skin. There is an underlying genetic predisposition to the development of DH but environmental factors are also important. Typically, young adults present with excoriations only, as the severe pruritus effectively destroys any primary lesions. Based upon our experience with DH and a comprehensive literature review, we provide an update of DH epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical presentation."
4615693	"There is much controversy regarding the ability of sunscreens to prevent ultraviolet (UV)-induced immune suppression. Epidermal Langerhans cells (LC) play a key antigen-presenting role in the afferent limb of the immune system's response to antigens introduced through the skin. It has been suggested that depletion of LC in UV-exposed skin is a critical step toward the induction of immunosuppression by UV radiation. There are a number of disparate reports with inconsistent results concerning the ability of sunscreens to prevent UV-induced depletion of LC. The purpose of this study was to systematically evaluate the ability of sunscreens to prevent UV-induced LC depletion in mice. Epidermal sheets obtained from skin biopsies taken from mice exposed to UV radiation from Kodacel-filtered FS20 sunlamps, which do not emit UV power at wavelengths <    290 nm, were immunoperoxidase stained for LC using a rat monoclonal antibody against mouse Ia (major histocompatibility complex class II antigen). Time course and dose-response curves for LC depletion were generated for Skh-1 and C3H mice. Dose-response curves for acute UV exposure induced depletion of LC in Skh-1 and C3H mice were similar, but not identical. LC density in the skin of Skh-1 mice that received chronic UV exposure (3 days/week for 8 weeks) was reduced by 62% after 2 weeks of exposure, but returned to normal levels by 6 weeks. Five commercial sunscreen lotions with labeled sun protection factors (SPF) of 4, 8, 15, 30 and 45 were tested for their capacity to block UV-induced depletion of LC. LC were depleted approximately 75% in the skin of unprotected or placebo lotion treated Skh-1 mice exposed to UV given on two consecutive days. Conversely, LC depletion was prevented in similarly UV exposed Skh-1 mice protected with a SPF 30 sunscreen. In C3H mice the levels of protection against LC depletion provided by the five sunscreens were proportional to the level of protection predicted by their labeled SPF. Comparisons of dose-response curves showed that significantly higher doses of UV were required for LC depletion and induction of skin edema than for the induction of local suppression of contact hypersensitivity. Thus, at UV doses where sunscreens provide complete protection against immunosuppression of contact hypersensitivity, prevention of LC depletion and skin edema would be expected."
1124626	"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection may change the outcome of patients undergoing stem cell transplantation. This study aimed at determining the prevalence of the HCV antibody in patients who were alive 10 or more years after BMT, defining the annual progression rate of hepatic fibrosis in those patients, and identifying cases of cirrhosis among those who were positive for HCV antibody. Between 1979 and 1990, 259 patients had a bone marrow transplant, and 91 were alive in March 2000. Of those, 80 were included in the study after having been scanned for serum HCV antibodies. A total of 39 were positive (48.8%), one was indeterminate and 40 were negative (50%). The patients who were HCV positive or undetermined were called for a medical appointment and 22 (55%) attended. A total of 16 patients (72.7%) were male, the mean age was 37.8+/-9.2 years and all of them had had an allogeneic transplant. Of the 22 patients studied, 12 (54.5%) agreed to have a liver biopsy. Hepatic fibrosis was diagnosed in 10 patients. The hepatic fibrosis annual progression rate was 0.156 UF/year. Among the anti-HCV-positive patients assessed, three (13.6%) already had cirrhosis."
5499878	"A unique, progressive syndrome of muscle weakness, ascending telangiectasia, and venous ectasia of the legs developed in a 55-year-old woman with autoimmune thyroiditis. Myopathy was documented by electromyography and electron microscopy. Her constellation of findings is considered to be of autoimmune origin. Treatment with acyclovir eliminated the patient's generalized telangiectasia. Cyclosporine therapy resulted in a marked but temporary reduction of the enlarged thyroid and of her elevated thyroglobulin and microsomal antibodies. Neither acyclovir nor cyclosporine had any demonstrable effect on the patient's muscle function or venous ectasia."
3555293	"Naegleria fowleri is a free-living amebic organism that causes acute meningoencephalitis and brain death in young people. Though this infection is limited to the central nervous system, organ donation is usually ruled out because of the infectious nature of the donor's death. Based on the realization that this organism is limited to the brain, we successfully transplanted organs from a 12-year-old male donor dying of N. fowleri infection. Kidneys, pancreas, a lung and liver were used with no evidence of posttransplant infectious complications. This unusual cause of brain death does not preclude successful organ donation."
2133953	"Currently, there is disagreement as to whether speckled lentiginous nevi (nevi spili) are congenital or acquired pigmented lesions. Part of this controversy is related to the natural history of these lesions that often present at birth as hyperpigmented patches and then take several years to reach their more readily recognized spotted form. Arguments in favor of speckled lentiginous nevi as a subtype of congenital nevi include the following observations: multiple reports of lesions present at birth or noted soon thereafter; patterns of distribution reflecting embryonic development; hamartomatous behavior with various types of nevi (eg, junctional nevi, blue nevi, and Spitz nevi) presenting in the same lesion over time; and histologic features of congenital melanocytic nevi within the spots. Herein we present additional evidence for the congenital nature of speckled lentiginous nevi.                                                                                   Ten patients are described with congenital pigmented lesions that had the clinical appearance of speckled lentiginous nevi in whole or in part. These lesions either evolved and acquired an appearance more suggestive of ""classic"" congenital nevi, or they existed as ""hybrid"" lesions with portions appearing as classic congenital nevi adjacent to or admixed with portions appearing as speckled lentiginous nevi. On histologic examination, biopsy specimens from the spots within these lesions showed features of congenital melanocytic nevi.                                                                                      These 10 cases, along with the arguments outlined above, provide strong support for the hypothesis that speckled lentiginous nevi are a subtype of congenital melanocytic nevi."
8862617	"Four days after foamsclerotherapy of an incompetent great saphenous vein of the left lower leg a 49-year-old woman developed a superficial thrombophlebitis of the venous dorsal arch. In the course of follow-up repeated color duplex sonography initially did not show involvement of the deep venous system and, hence, she was treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and compression hosiery. However, six weeks after foam treatment we diagnosed a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) of the popliteal vein and started an oral anticoagulant therapy. Although rarely observed, DVT is among the most serious complications of foamsclerotherapy Therefore, we suggest that the occurrence of a superficial thrombophlebitis that is not located in close vicinity of the vein treated should be an indication for regular follow-up examinations to prevent missing the occurrence of disease progression and a possible involvement of the deep venous system."
2081423	"Cultured normal human adult keratinocytes were exposed to (S)-(+)- camptothecin over the concentration range 10(-5) to 10(-10) M. The dose-dependent inhibition of growth was recorded using cell counting. The induction of terminal differentiation was demonstrated by the relative increase in squamous and cornified cells, and the concomitant decrease in small, proliferative cells, with an overall decrease in total cell numbers on going from 10(-10) to 10(-6) M concentration of the drug. The induction of apoptosis was studied by assay of two types of transglutaminase, ""tissue"" and ""keratinocyte"", and by assay of histone-linked mono- and oligonucleosomes. Induction of apoptosis was accompanied with increase in ""tissue"" transglutaminase and in the amount of nucleosomes, the latter being indicative of endonuclease activity. This activity was sharply increased at a camptothecin concentration of 10(-5) M, and may have been facilitated by ""tissue"" transglutaminase at lower concentrations. The data suggest that camptothecin restricts keratinocyte growth by several mechanisms including apoptosis and emphasize its possible use in topical therapy for psoriasis."
5376603	"Heart failure is one of the leading causes of hospitalization in the United States. Congestive heart failure is a chronic, progressive disease and its central element is remodeling of the cardiac chamber associated with ventricular dilation. Secondary mitral regurgitation is a complication of end-stage cardiomyopathy and is associated with poor prognosis. Historically, these patients were not considered operative candidates because of their high morbidity and mortality. Heart transplantation is now considered standard treatment for select patients with end-stage heart disease; however, it is applicable only to a small number of patients. In an effort to address this problem, newer and alternative surgical approaches are evolving, including mitral valve annuloplasty, the Batista procedure, and other left ventricular shape changing technologies. Using these operative techniques to alter the shape of the left ventricle, in combination with optimal medical management for heart failure, improves survival, and patients may avoid or postpone transplantation."
4653089	"Whole-slide imaging with virtual microscopy is increasingly used as a tool in resident education and training, board certification and maintenance of certification examinations, and diagnostic evaluation. The objective of this study was to determine attitudes toward virtual microscopy compared with traditional glass slide microscopy during a continuing medical education dermatopathology workshop.                                                                              Twenty-three board-certified, practicing or retired dermatopathologists were given 26 ""advanced"" cases to review using both virtual microscopy and traditional glass slides. Diagnostic accuracy was not assessed because of the complexity of the cases. Participants were surveyed on: (i) their previous experience with digital imaging; (ii) the quality, ease of use, and speed of slide review; and (iii) overall attitudes toward digital and traditional review.                                                                              Equal proportions of participants did and did not have prior experience with digital imaging of histopathologic specimens. Most participants preferred to use both virtual microscopy and traditional microscopy together. The quality of glass slides was rated as better than that of digital images, but virtual microscopy achieved higher ratings for ease of navigation and overall satisfaction.                                                                                      Virtual microscopy is a useful tool for dermatopathology workshops. Specifically, dermatopathologists with and without prior digital slide review experience responded favorably to viewing slides on a computer monitor. Overall satisfaction was high, and the majority of participants indicated that they would use virtual microscopy in the future. These results show a trend toward the acceptance of digital slide review, which supports the inevitable expansion of this practice in an increasingly digitized world."
5840784	"Cyanobacteria, algae and plants reduce photosystem contents and modulate photosystem stoichiometry upon acclimation to high-light (HL) conditions to avoid the damage due to excess light energy. In order to elucidate the molecular mechanism of HL acclimation, mRNA levels of genes encoding subunits of photosystems were examined in response to change of photon flux density in the wild-type strain of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Transcript levels and promoter activities of photosystem I (PSI) genes rapidly decreased upon the shift to HL to less than 10% of the initial level within 1 h, whereas responses of photosystem II (PSII) transcript levels were not coordinated. The prompt change in promoter activities of PSI genes, but not PSII genes, seems important for Synechocystis cells to regulate their photosystem contents in response to changes in photon flux density. The mRNA stabilities of PSI genes also decreased during HL incubation. The down-regulation of PSI transcripts under HL did not depend on de novo protein synthesis, contrasting with the requirement of newly synthesized protein factor(s) for the accumulation of PSI transcripts under low light. When gene expression profiles of wild-type cells and a pmgA-disrupted mutant that cannot modulate photosystem stoichiometry under HL were compared, a large increase in the psaAB and psaA transcript levels was observed in the mutant under prolonged exposure to HL for 6 h. Repression of the promoter activity of the psaA gene by a pmgA-dependent mechanism was shown to be essential for the adjustment of photosystem stoichiometry under HL conditions."
2575069	"Skin metastasis of primary gallbladder tumors is extremely rare with a reported incidence of 0.7~9% and it usually involves the thorax, abdomen, the extremities, neck, head region, and scalp. Cutaneous metastasis may occur synchronously or metatochronously. In the present case, the patient had chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which was being treated with an alkylating agent (chlorambucil) when the patient developed skin metastasis from gallbladder adenocarcinoma during post- cholecystectomy follow-up. Given the fact that secondary malignancies occur in chronic lymphocytic leukemia; this clinical setting warrants attention. We aimed to discuss secondary malignancy in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients and gallbladder adenocarcinoma with skin metastasis, based on a review of the literature and the presented case."
1600498	"Polymorphous light eruption (PLE) is a common disorder characterized by a delayed, abnormal response to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, with a varied morphology of itching efflorescences on sun-exposed areas of the skin. Thirty-one PLE subjects were treated with either UVA (340-400 nm) or UVA and UVB (300-400 nm) phototherapy during spring 1987 (10 exposures to UV light). They were randomly allocated to these 2 groups. For subjects of the UVA group, the applied dose corresponded to their individual minimal tanning dose; for subjects of the UVA and UVB group it corresponded to approximately 3/4 of their individual minimal erythema dose. The sun protection effect was studied by a high dose of UVA (80-160 J/cm2; 340-440 nm) after the treatment period, by analysing the histidine content of the stratum corneum and the urocanic acid photoisomerization, and by evaluating the subjects' diaries. The patients were asked to expose their skin to sunlight at least 3 times after UV hardening in the following 2-10 weeks. The results of both the UVA provocation and of the natural sun exposure confirmed the success of UV hardening without the occurrence of severe side effects. The content of histidine and of its metabolite urocanic acid in stratum corneum was significantly increased during the treatment. These data are interpreted to be biochemical markers for improved sun protection."
2843476	"Morsicatio labiorum is a form of tissue alteration caused by self-induced injury, mostly occurring on the lips, and is considered to be a rarely encountered mucocutaneous disorder. Clinically, it is a macerated grey-white patch and plaque of the mucosa caused by external stimuli (self-induced injury) such as habitual biting, chewing, or sucking of the lip. It is often confused with other dermatological disorders involving the oral mucosa, which can lead to a misdiagnosis. We herein report three cases of morsicatio labiorum; two cases were misdiagnosed as exfoliative cheilitis at the time of the first visit."
3936427	"In Spain, despite its high rate of cadaveric donation, death while on the liver transplant waiting list is high. For this reason, living liver donation is being encouraged despite of the risk of morbidity for the donor. The objective of this study was to analyze attitudes toward living liver donation among hospital personnel in a hospital with a recently authorized living donor liver transplantation program. A random sample was taken and was stratified by type of service and job category (n = 1,262). Attitude was evaluated by means of a validated psychosocial questionnaire. The questionnaire was completed anonymously and was self-administered. Statistical analysis included the Student t test, the chi(2) test, and logistical regression analysis. The questionnaire completion rate was 93% (n = 1,168). Only 15% (n = 170) of respondents were in favor of living liver donation if it were unrelated. An additional 65% (n = 766) were in favor if this donation, but only for relatives. Of the rest, 9% (n = 107) did not agree with living liver donation, and the remaining 11% (n = 125) were undecided. The variables related to this attitude were age (P = 0.044); job category (P = 0.002); type of service (according to whether it is related to organ donation and transplantation) (P = 0.044); participation in prosocial activities (P = 0.026); attitude toward cadaveric organ donation (P <   0.001); attitude of a respondent's partner toward organ donation (P = 0.010); a respondent's belief that in the future, he or she may need a transplant (P <    0.001); and a willingness to receive a donated living liver organ if one were needed (P <    0.001). There is also a close relationship between attitude toward living kidney donation and living liver donation (P <    0.001). In the multivariate analysis, the only common independent variable from the bivariate analysis was a willingness to receive a living donor liver transplant if one were needed (odds ratio = 9.3). Attitude toward living liver donation among hospital personnel in a hospital with a solid organ transplant program is favorable and is affected by factors related to cadaveric donation, altruistic activity, and feelings of reciprocity. Physicians and the youngest hospital workers are those who are most in favor, which leads us to think that there is a promising future for living liver transplantation, which is essential given the cadaveric organ deficit and the high mortality rate while on the waiting list."
9854953	"Alterations in renal prostaglandin production have recently been postulated to modulate the decrease in renal blood flow associated with cyclosporine nephrotoxicity. In particular, increases in renal production of the potent vasoconstrictor thromboxane A2 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of this disorder. The present study was undertaken to explore the relationship between alterations in urinary thromboxane B2 excretion (UTxB2V) and CsA nephrotoxicity in two rat models. Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were treated for 14 days with CsA 50 mg/kg/day (n = 8) or olive oil (C) (n = 9) by gavage. Creatinine clearance (Ccr), urine flow (V), and urinary excretion rates of sodium, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), glucose, and TxB2 were determined before and after treatment. A similar study was conducted using Fischer rats (CsA: n = 10, C: n = 13). In Fischer rats, CsA caused a 35% decrease in Ccr (P = 0.01), a 33% decrease in sodium excretion (P = 0.02), and a greater than 2-fold increase in NAG excretion (P = 0.03), while V, glucose excretion, and UTxB2V did not change. Although similar changes in sodium and NAG excretion were seen after CsA administration in SD rats, Ccr was not affected. Additional findings in SD rats included a 3-fold increase in V (P less than 0.01), a 24-fold increase in glucose excretion (P = 0.03), and a 5-fold increase in UTxB2V (P = 0.04). Thus, Fischer rats developed CsA nephrotoxicity in the absence of increased UTxB2V. In contrast, SD rats failed to develop nephrotoxicity despite a marked increase in UTxB2V. We conclude that changes in renal TxA2 production are unrelated to the development of CsA nephrotoxicity."
3077453	"Angiopoietin 2 (Angpt2) impairs endothelial function by preventing angiopoietin 1 from binding to their common endothelial-specific receptor Tie2. Here, we examined whether circulating Angpt2 predicts outcome in kidney transplant recipients. For this case-cohort study, we selected 130 kidney transplant recipients who had died or returned to dialysis within the first 2 years of follow-up of our cohort study, as well as 130 age- and gender-matched kidney transplant recipients without an event (controls) from a total of 993 kidney transplant recipients. The total of 260 selected patients were followed in median 4 years. Serum Angpt2 at baseline was measured using an in-house immunoluminometric assay. Median Angpt2 concentrations were significantly higher in patients who died [median (interquartile range--IQR) 3.6 (2.8-5.9) ng/ml] as compared to patients who did not die during the study period [2.8 (2.1-4.1) ng/ml; P <    0.001]. Ln (natural log) Angpt2 levels correlated positively with C-reactive protein levels (r = 0.315, P <    0.001) and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (r = 0.188, P = 0.002) and were inversely associated with eGFR (r = -0.301, P <    0.001) hemoglobin (r = -0.269, P <    0.001), and serum albumin concentrations (r = -0.382, P <    0.001). On multivariate analyses, baseline Angpt2 levels independently predicted all-cause mortality (multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio associated with one natural log unit higher Angpt2 level: 1.70 (95% confidence interval: 1.10-2.61)). In our analysis, circulating Angpt2 was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in stable, prevalent kidney transplant recipients."
8613482	"The pathogenesis of Hailey-Hailey disease and Darier's disease was investigated using immunocytological and explant-tissue-culture techniques. There was breakdown of the intercellular adhesions between keratinocytes in explants from clinically uninvolved skin of patients with Hailey-Hailey disease or Darier's disease. The major desmosomal components were present in the cultures and were expressed in a punctate peripheral pattern at cell-cell contact sites, but there was diffuse staining of acantholytic cells. Plasminogen, which is expressed by basal keratinocytes in normal skin, was detected in association with suprabasal acantholytic cells in skin biopsies from these diseases. Plasminogen was reversibly displaced from the cells by 6-aminohexanoic acid, suggesting that binding is mediated by a reaction with the lysine receptor on the plasminogen molecule. Plasminogen was also detected in separating cells in explant cultures and there was cytoplasmic expression of the plasminogen activator urokinase by these cells. These abnormalities are not unique to either disease and do not account for the phenotypic differences between Darier's disease and Hailey-Hailey disease, but plasmin generation may have a role in perpetuating cell separation."
8259538	"RNAi technology was applied to down regulate LuPLR1 gene expression in flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) seeds. This gene encodes a pinoresinol lariciresinol reductase responsible for the synthesis of (+)-secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG), the major lignan accumulated in the seed coat. If flax lignans biological properties and health benefits are well documented their roles in planta remain unclear. This loss of function strategy was developed to better understand the implication of the PLR1 enzyme in the lignan biosynthetic pathway and to provide new insights on the functions of these compounds. RNAi plants generated exhibited LuPLR1 gene silencing as demonstrated by quantitative RT-PCR experiments and the failed to accumulate SDG. The accumulation of pinoresinol the substrate of the PLR1 enzyme under its diglucosylated form (PDG) was increased in transgenic seeds but did not compensate the overall loss of SDG. The monolignol flux was also deviated through the synthesis of 8-5' linked neolignans dehydrodiconiferyl alcohol glucoside (DCG) and dihydro-dehydrodiconiferyl alcohol glucoside (DDCG) which were observed for the first time in flax seeds."
3239310	"The immunophenotypic characteristics of the skin pathergy reaction (SPR) at 48 h in Behçet's disease (BD) were investigated in 12 patients with BD and in five controls. The findings in 11 positive and one negative SPR lesions of patients with BD were evaluated in comparison with those of normal adjacent skin and with the negative pathergy biopsies from the controls. Positive SPR biopsies showed variable epidermal thickening and cell vacuolization, as well as subcorneal pustule formation. In the SPR dermis, a variable dense focal mononuclear cell (MNC) infiltrate was seen around vessels and skin appendages, extending into the deep dermis. The MNC infiltrate was predominantly composed of T lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages. The majority of the T lymphocytes were CD4+, and almost all expressed CD45RO. Approximately half of the infiltrating cells strongly expressed HLA-DR. Neutrophils constituted less than 5% of the infiltrating cells, but were present as clusters of elastase-positive cells at the needle-prick sites. Vessels within the lesion showed marked congestion and endothelial swelling. The endothelial cells expressed ICAM-1 strongly, and E-selectin moderately. VCAM-1 was not expressed on endothelial cells. The basal and mid-epidermal layers of keratinocytes expressed HLA-DR and ICAM-1 strongly, particularly so in areas close to the dermal MNC infiltrates. In negative pathergy biopsies, there were increased numbers of neutrophils and a few small clusters of macrophages and T lymphocytes only at the needle-prick site, and the endothelial cells of vessels close to these areas expressed E-selectin weakly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

LCO biosynthesis in A. caulinodans is dependent on the nodABCSUIJZnoeC operon. Until now, the role of the nodulation protein NodU in the synthesis of azorhizobial LCOs remained unclear. Based on sequence similarities and structural analysis of LCOs produced by a nodU mutant, a complemented nodU mutant, and Escherichia coli DH5 alpha expressing the nodABCSU genes, NodU was shown to be involved in the carbamoylation step."
8477932	"Previously an increased frequency of KIT aberrations in mucosal melanomas was reported, whereas c-KIT in most types of cutaneous melanomas does not appear to be of pathogenetic importance. Imatinib has become the standard of care in other cancers with KIT mutations such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Recently 12 cases of metastatic melanoma and KIT-activating mutations have been published to be successfully treated with c-KIT blockers such as imatinib, sunitinib, dasatinib or sorafenib. We report here on one of our patients with KIT-activating mutation in metastatic anal mucosal melanoma, who showed a response to imatinib therapy and summarize the available literature regarding this new therapeutic option."
2295103	"This article reviews treatment options of the approved and soon-to-be approved direct-acting antiviral (DAA)-based therapies in the transplant setting.                                                                                      DAA-based therapies have been shown to be effective and safe in achieving viral eradication in the majority of pre- and postliver transplant (LT) populations. Treatment decisions are guided by hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype, the degree of renal dysfunction, and severity of cirrhosis. The addition of ribavirin is frequently needed to achieve highest viral eradication rates. Viral eradication pre-LT has been associated with fewer portal hypertensive complications and improved survival and effectively prevents recurrent HCV post-LT. For those with shorter time to LT, an alternative strategy is treatment with DAAs up to the time of LT to reduce the risk of post-LT recurrence. Therapies should be considered for all post-LT patients with recurrent HCV given the risk of accelerated disease progression. The sustained virological response rates among LT recipients parallel those of nontransplant patients.                                                                                  With broader application of DAA therapy in the transplant setting, improved graft and patient survival and simplified post-LT management are likely. The availability of high potency DAA therapy with excellent safety profiles has transformed the HCV-infected LT population into a group that is no longer 'difficult-to-treat.'"
4348086	"Three pregnancies occurred in a cohort of 40 patients with Hansen disease during a 6-year period. There are few recent reports in the English literature that deal with pregnancy in patients with Hansen disease. These 3 cases are presented in the context of previously reported cohorts.                                                                                   In patient 1, symptoms of the disease appeared during pregnancy. In patient 2, reactivation vs reaction occurred during pregnancy in a previously treated patient. In patient 3, the fetus was exposed to 3 antimicrobial drugs during the first trimester.                                                                                      The pregnant state causes a relative decrease in cellular immunity. This decrease allows Mycobacterium leprae to proliferate, which may precipitate or worsen disease, leading to permanent nerve damage. Careful management of reactional states and treatment of patients with dapsone monotherapy can prevent this nerve damage. Infants are usually much less affected than mothers; however, selection of the mother's antimicrobial regimen must ensure adequate control of the bacteria while avoiding teratogenicity and in utero adverse effects."
2151767	"Topical psoralen plus UVA (PUVA) is an effective treatment for localized forms of eczema, psoriasis, and palmoplantar pustulosis, which avoids some of the undesirable side-effects of systemic psoralens. Aims In this study, the efficacy of topical PUVA treatment with 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) gel was compared with placebo plus UVA in chronic recurrent palmoplantar dermatoses.                                                                              Twenty-two patients with palmoplantar disease (11 with psoriasis vulgaris, six with eczema, and five with pustulosis) were enrolled in the study. The study design was a left-right comparison: one hand or foot was treated with 8-MOP 0.01% gel plus UVA, whilst the contralateral hand or foot received placebo and UVA for 6 weeks. Twenty minutes after application of the gel, both sides were exposed to UVA. The treatment regimen was three times a week, and the UVA dose was increased weekly by 20%.                                                                              A comparison of the pre- and post-treatment scores with regard to the severity of the clinical picture and the infiltration of plaques showed a significant decrease (from 7.5 +/- 2.0 to 2.5 +/- 2.1 and from 2.0 +/- 0.7 to 0.3 +/- 0.5, respectively) in the sites treated with 8-MOP gel compared with placebo after 6 weeks.                                                                                     The results of the study indicate that at least 18 courses of local PUVA within 6 weeks, with a cumulative dose of 87 J/cm(2), are required to induce a significant decrease in the disease severity and an improvement in the infiltration of plaques due to 8-MOP gel at a concentration of 0.01% when treating chronic recurrent palmoplantar dermatoses."
4887644	"The need to find a safe, effective liver support system for patients with fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) continues to be unmet. A system using immortalized human hepatocytes was originally developed in the early 1990s. A modified version of the initial extracorporeal liver-assist device (ELAD) was recently placed into an initial clinical trial at the University of Chicago. The goal of this study was to determine the safety profile of the device at one center before broadening the study to other sites.                                                                              Patients who were diagnosed with FHF and admitted to the University of Chicago were eligible for the ELAD study. Informed consent was obtained, and patients received continuous ELAD therapy until and throughout transplantation. Data were prospectively collected and subsequently analyzed.                                                                              Five patients were treated with the device. All patients successfully underwent transplantation. Four of the five patients survived to the 30-day endpoint of the study. There were no biomechanical problems identified. The patients' hemodynamic conditions did not deteriorate during treatment. The adult patients' clinical courses appeared to stabilize while connected to the ELAD (mean arterial pressure range 80-97, mean 88.6; cerebral perfusion pressure range 62-88, mean 76.5). Patient 4 experienced remarkable improvement during ELAD therapy: elimination of phenylephrine, reduction of dopamine from 20 microg/min to 5 microg/min, and reduction of respiratory support from 100% O2, 10 cm positive end-expiratory pressure to 60% O2, and 5 cm H2O positive end-expiratory pressure. The device continued to be metabolically active throughout the study period as documented by oxygen use (mean O2 change from sampling port before cartridge to sampling port after cartridge for all patients treated = 55 mm Hg).                                                                                      The patients tolerated treatment with the ELAD well. There were no unanticipated safety issues. The cells in the cartridges were metabolically active. All patients successfully underwent transplantation. The results from this single-institution experience indicates that larger randomized multicenter trials should proceed."
3887392	"Tinea incognito is a dermatophyte infection of the skin that presents atypically because it has previously been treated with imunnosuppresive medication. Herein we present a case of a middle-aged man who was initially clinically diagnosed to have plaque-type psoriasis on his arms. Over the course of two months of topical hydrocortisone and calciptriol treatment as well as phototherapy, the rash worsened. At the time of presentation to hospital the patient had a pruritic, widespread, sloughing, erythematous rash with areas of eschar. A punch biopsy skin confirmed dermatophyte fungal infection of the skin. Fungal culture was positive for Trichophyton Rubrum and the eruption resolved with systemic anti-fungal therapy. Patient specific risk factors for atypical presentation included poor hygiene and hepatatic disease."
9907571	"Mast cells in skin are distributed around dermal and subcutaneous blood vessels. Activation of tissue mast cells produces secretion and/or generation and secretion of a variety of biologically active molecules. Mast-cell-dependent mediators may be classified as smooth-muscle-contracting and vasoactive activities, chemotactic factors, enzymes, and proteoglycans. These mediators alter the microenvironment to produce a biphasic response. The initial or humoral phase of the response is mediated by materials that alter vascular permeability; peripheral blood leukocytes attracted by chemotactic factors establish the cellular phase. Failure to limit the humoral phase creates a pharmacologic state that may be recognized in skin as urticaria/angioedema. The inability to control the cellular phase permits progression to a local inflammatory state with subacute and chronic tissue injury recognized in skin, for example, as necrotizing vasculitis. As an example of the former, certain forms of physical urticaria have provided experimental models in humans to allow observation of the clinical manifestations, study of tissue alterations by histologic analysis, measurement of mediators released into the circulation, and assessment of motility of peripheral blood leukocytes. An example of the role of the mast cell in the production of subacute and chronic inflammatory cutaneous disease is suggested by studies in a patient in whom exposure to the physical stimuli of cold and trauma was followed by initial mast cell degranulation, subsequent tissue deposition of circulating immune complexes, and the development of a necrotizing vasculitis."
9203208	"Jasmonates are plant signaling molecules that play key roles in defense against certain pathogens and insects, among others, by controlling the biosynthesis of protective secondary metabolites. In Catharanthus roseus, the APETALA2-domain transcription factor ORCA3 is involved in the jasmonate-responsive activation of terpenoid indole alkaloid biosynthetic genes. ORCA3 gene expression is itself induced by jasmonate. By loss- and gain-of-function experiments, we located a 74-bp region within the ORCA3 promoter, which contains an autonomous jasmonate-responsive element (JRE). The ORCA3 JRE is composed of two important sequences: a quantitative sequence responsible for a high level of expression and a qualitative sequence that appears to act as an on/off switch in response to methyl jasmonate. We isolated 12 different DNA-binding proteins having one of four different types of DNA-binding domains, using the ORCA3 JRE as bait in a yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) one-hybrid transcription factor screening. The binding of one class of proteins bearing a single AT-hook DNA-binding motif was affected by mutations in the quantitative sequence within the JRE. Two of the AT-hook proteins tested had a weak activating effect on JRE-mediated reporter gene expression, suggesting that AT-hook family members may be involved in determining the level of expression of ORCA3 in response to jasmonate."
9450741	"The optimum method of donor natural killer cell infusion (DNKI) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) remains unclear. Fifty-one patients (age range, 19 years to 67 years) with refractory acute leukemia underwent HLA-haploidentical HCT and underwent DNKI on days 6, 9, 13, and 20 of HCT. Median DNKI doses were .5, .5, 1.0, and 2.0 × 10     8      /kg cells, respectively. During DNKI, 33 of the 45 evaluated patients (73%) developed fever (>   38.3°C) along with weight gain (median, 13%; range, 2% to 31%) and/or hyperbilirubinemia (median, 6.2 mg/dL; range, 1.0 mg/dL to 35.1 mg/dL); the toxicity was reversible in 90% of patients. After transplantation, we observed cumulative incidences of neutrophil engraftment (≥500/µL), grade 2 to 4 acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), chronic GVHD, and nonrelapse mortality of 84%, 28%, 30%, and 16%, respectively. The leukemia complete remission rate was 57% at 1 month after HCT and 3-year cumulative incidence of leukemia progression was 75%. When analyzed together with our historical cohort of 40 patients with refractory acute leukemia who underwent haploidentical HCT and DNKI on days 14 and 21 only, higher expression of NKp30 (>   90%) on donor NK cells was an independent predictor of higher complete remission (hazard ratio, 5.59) and less leukemia progression (hazard ratio, .57). Additional DNKI on days 6 and 9 was not associated with less leukemia progression (75% versus 55%)."
8639897	"Onychomycosis is a common nail infection caused by dermatophytes, yeast or other nondermatophyte molds and has diverse clinical presentations. Although common in this part of the country, no significant clinico-mycologic data is available.                                                                                   This study was carried out to document the clinico-mycologic pattern of onychomycosis in Himachal Pradesh (India).                                                                              All consecutive patients of onychomycosis diagnosed clinically during March 2005 to February 2006 were studied for clinical forms, number of nails involved and severity of infection. The clippings from the most severely affected nails were subjected to potassium hydroxide (KOH) mounts for direct microscopy and fungal culture on Sabouraud's dextrose agar.                                                                              These 130 patients (M:F 98:32) were between 8-76 years of age (mean 41.35 +/- 14.98 years). The prevalence of onychomycosis was higher among farmers and office workers (20% each). Finger or toe nails were exclusively involved in 56.9 and 32.3% patients respectively while these were involved concurrently in the rest of the 10.8% patients. Distal and lateral subungual onychomycosis seen in 73.1% of the specimens was the most common clinical type. KOH- and culture-positivity were recorded in 59.2 and 37.6% cases respectively. Dermatophytes and yeast (Candida albicans) were isolated in 40.8% each of the cultured nail specimens while nondermatophytic molds (NDM) were cultured in 18.6% of the samples. Various dermatophytes cultured were Trichophyton rubrum (32.6%), T. mentagrophytes (6.1%) and T. verrucosum (2.1%) respectively. Aspergillus spp. (6.1%) was the most commonly isolated NDM while other detected molds were Acremonium spp, Fusarium spp,, Scopulariopsis spp, Curvularia spp. and Penicillium marneffei. Peripheral vascular disorders (7.69%), occupational trauma (13.8%), close association with animals (60.78%) and a family history of onychomycosis (26.15%) were a few of the predisposing factors identified.

4628934	"We identified a novel mutation of a nuclear-encoded gene, designated as CRUMPLED LEAF (CRL), of Arabidopsis thaliana that affects the morphogenesis of all plant organs and division of plastids. Histological analysis revealed that planes of cell division were distorted in shoot apical meristems (SAMs), root tips, and embryos in plants that possess the crl mutation. Furthermore, we observed that differentiation patterns of cortex and endodermis cells in inflorescence stems and root endodermis cells were disturbed in the crl mutant. These results suggest that morphological abnormalities observed in the crl mutant were because of aberrant cell division and differentiation. In addition, cells of the crl mutant contained a reduced number of enlarged plastids, indicating that the division of plastids was inhibited in the crl. The CRL gene encodes a novel protein with a molecular mass of 30 kDa that is localized in the plastid envelope. The CRL protein is conserved in various plant species, including a fern, and in cyanobacteria, but not in other organisms. These data suggest that the CRL protein is required for plastid division, and it also plays an important role in cell differentiation and the regulation of the cell division plane in plants. A possible function of the CRL protein is discussed."

A mesial and distal papilla regrowth mean of 1.8 and 1.5 mm, respectively, were found. The midfacial soft tissue levels showed 0.12 mm of mean recession after 24 months.                                                                                     Immediate implants with a laser microtextured surface restored at the day of surgery, may be considered as a predictable procedure in terms of implant survival and hard and soft tissue remodeling."
5385636	"Plant trait engineering requires efficient targeted genome-editing technologies. Clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPRs)/ CRISPR associated (Cas) type II system is used for targeted genome-editing applications across eukaryotic species including plants. Delivery of genome engineering reagents and recovery of mutants remain challenging tasks for in planta applications. Recently, we reported the development of Tobacco rattle virus (TRV)-mediated genome editing in Nicotiana benthamiana. TRV infects the growing points and possesses small genome size; which facilitate cloning, multiplexing, and agroinfections. Here, we report on the persistent activity and specificity of the TRV-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 system for targeted modification of the Nicotiana benthamiana genome. Our data reveal the persistence of the TRV- mediated Cas9 activity for up to 30 d post-agroinefection. Further, our data indicate that TRV-mediated genome editing exhibited no off-target activities at potential off-targets indicating the precision of the system for plant genome engineering. Taken together, our data establish the feasibility and exciting possibilities of using virus-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 for targeted engineering of plant genomes."
6587122	"Embryonic stem (ES) cells have been regarded as a powerful resource for cell replacement therapy. In recent reports mouse ES cells have been successfully applied in the treatment of spinal cord injury, hereditary myelin disorder of the central nervous system, and diabetes mellitus. Another type of disease that could benefit from the availability of stem cell therapy is liver disease. However, for this potential to be realized, it is necessary to demonstrate the differentiation of ES cells into hepatocytes. To demonstrate the in vivo differentiation potential of mouse ES cells, we injected ES cells into the spleen of immunosuppressed nude mice. Histological analysis of teratomas derived from injected ES cells revealed that some areas contained typical hepatocytes arranged in a sinusoidal structure. The hepatic nature of these cells was further confirmed by showing that transcripts of liver-specific genes were present in the differentiated teratoma using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry using several liver-specific antibodies including HEP-PAR, phenylalanine hydroxylase, and mouse N-system aminotransferase to identify the respective proteins in the differentiated hepatocytes. This is the first demonstration that mouse ES cells can differentiate in vivo into a mixed population of hepatocytes of varying maturity. This finding extends the potential use of ES cells in the cell replacement therapy by including its possible application for treating liver diseases."
2268070	"We previously validated a scoring system for abdominal/pelvic CT scans in patients with symptomatic encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS). CT scans of patients with symptomatic EPS were significantly different from control peritoneal dialysis (PD) or haemodialysis patient scans; scans performed before EPS was clinically evident were near normal in 9 of 13 patients. We have now investigated CT scanning as a screening modality in a larger group of patients on long-term PD.                                                                              Pre-diagnostic CT scans performed in 20 patients for routine screening or other indications at least 3 months before EPS developed, and later diagnostic scans when EPS was clinically evident, were scored by three radiologists. The control group included CT scans of 20 PD patients who had not developed EPS (median follow-up 2.25 years). Analysis was by non-parametric tests. CT scores ranged from 0 to 22; >    2.5 was considered abnormal.                                                                              Clinical EPS only developed after transplantation or transfer to HD. Diagnostic scans scored significantly higher than pre-diagnostic or control scans (median scores 9, 2 and 1; P <    0.001), confirming previous work. The pre-EPS diagnosis of 12 asymptomatic patients had a median CT score = 1.75, similar to the control group. Eight patients had had a limited episode of abdominal symptoms (seven required hospitalization), but did not have the clinical picture of EPS; their median CT score was 4.5 (P = 0.0016 cf control group). The time from pre-diagnostic scan to clinical EPS (median 0.82 years) and duration of PD at time of pre-diagnostic scan (median 7.1 years) did not differ significantly between the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups.                                                                                      CT screening of asymptomatic PD patients is not indicated; EPS may occur within a year or less of a normal CT scan. Abdominal symptoms in long-term PD patients can be associated with CT scan abnormalities; these patients are at increased risk of EPS after stopping PD."
5022300	"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors are becoming more common in the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. These medications have a low incidence of serious adverse events and are generally considered safe; however, they do make patients more susceptible to tuberculosis (TB) infection both through latent reactivation and primary infection. We describe a case of a patient who had an initial negative tuberculin skin test (TST), began TNF inhibitor therapy, and then 11 years later was diagnosed with active TB. After the initial screening, the patient did not have any subsequent screenings for TB and no apparent change to his TB risk status. TB is still common in many areas of the United States and travel is not necessary to be exposed. Patients on TNF inhibitors that develop active TB have increased morbidity and mortality than those who are not. It is necessary that dermatologists limit the risk of TB to patients by screening them before initiation and annually when they are on the TNF inhibitor."
4859599	"Members of the AP2 family of transcription factors, such as BABY BOOM (BBM), play important roles in cell proliferation and embryogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana (AtBBM) and Brassica napus (BnBBM) but how this occurs is not understood. We have isolated three AP2 genes (GmBBM1, GmAIL5, GmPLT2) from somatic embryo cultures of soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merr, and discovered GmBBM1 to be homologous to AtBBM and BnBBM. GmAIL5 and GmPLT2 were homologous to Arabidopsis AINTEGUMENTA-like5 (AIL5) and PLETHORA2 (PLT2), respectively. Constitutive expression of GmBBM1 in Arabidopsis induced somatic embryos on vegetative organs and other pleiotropic effects on post-germinative vegetative organ development. Sequence comparisons of BBM orthologues revealed the presence of ten sequence motifs outside of the AP2 DNA-binding domains. One of the motifs, bbm-1, was specific to the BBM-like genes. Deletion and domain swap analyses revealed that bbm-1 was important for somatic embryogenesis and acted cooperatively with at least one other motif, euANT2, in the regulation of somatic embryogenesis and embryo development in transgenic Arabidopsis. The results provide new insights into the mechanisms by which BBM governs embryogenesis."
4024076	"NADH-dependent glutamate synthase (NADH-GOGAT) is a key enzyme in primary ammonia assimilation in Phaseolus vulgaris nodules. Two different types of cDNA clones of PvNADH-GOGAT were isolated from the nodule cDNA libraries. The full-length cDNA clones of PvNADH-GOGAT-I (7.4 kb) and PvNADH-GOGAT-II (7.0 kb), which displayed an 83% homology between them, were isolated using cDNA library screening, 'cDNA library walking' and RT-PCR amplification. Southern analysis employing specific 5' cDNA probes derived from PvNADH-GOGAT-I and PvNADH-GOGAT-II indicated the existence of a single copy of each gene in the bean genome. Both these proteins contain approximately 100 amino acid sequences theoretically addressing each isoenzyme to different subcellular compartments. RT-PCR analysis indicated that PvNADH-GOGAT-II expression is higher than PvNADH-GOGAT-I during nodule development. Expression analysis by RT-PCR also revealed that both of these genes are differentially regulated by sucrose. On the other hand, the expression of PvNADH-GOGAT-I, but not PvNADH-GOGAT-II, was inhibited with nitrogen compounds. In situ hybridization and promoter expression analyses demonstrated that the NADH-GOGAT-I and -II genes are differentially expressed in bean root and nodule tissues. In silico analyses of the NADH-GOGAT promoters revealed the presence of potential cis elements in them that could mediate differential tissue-specific, and sugar and amino acid responsive expression of these genes."
2082198	"Cadmium is an important environmental pollutant with high toxicity to plants. We report the effects of high-dose Cd (100 micro M for 21 days) on the root apparatus of Phragmites australis plants, which are characterized by elevated water detoxification capacity and widely used in phytoremediation programmes. The examination of root sections by light and electron microscopy failed to reveal any significant cadmium-induced structural or ultra-structural modifications. However, histochemical localization of Cd disclosed accumulation of the metal in the parenchyma cells below the exodermis. Phytochelatins (PC) are thiol-rich peptides whose synthesis is induced by a range of metals. Our results indicate that total PC production increases after exposure to Cd, which suggests a pivotal role for phytochelatins in the sequestration of metal. Cd treatment also induced lignin deposition and marked stimulation of root antioxidant systems, suggesting that, because of its ability to adopt different strategies against the harmful effects of cadmium, Phragmites australis is a plant with high detoxification potential."
7338656	"For many children with life-threatening hematological diseases, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative option. In children lacking a matched related or unrelated donor and with the certainty that, left untreated, death will ensue alternative donors must be sought. Haplo-identical peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) from a healthy parent is a feasible alternative. To reduce the risk of fatal graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) as a complication of transplant across major histocompatibility antigens, intense T-cell depletion is required. Large numbers of purified, cytokine mobilized peripheral stem cells (the so-called mega-dose concept) are required to compensate for the significantly increased risk of either graft failure or early rejection. In our unit, despite this approach, graft dysfunction has, in a significant group of children, proved problematic and, despite salvage attempts at re-transplantation, usually fatal. In children with hematological malignant disease, our overall relapse-free survival is 41%. However, successful transplant outcome has been associated with considerable delays in immune reconstitution that can be implicated in subsequent viral reactivation. We are investigating new strategies to improve the outcome of haplo-identical PBSCT, which may allow us to offer this form of treatment to more children requiring urgent HSCT."
7937997	"Continuous perfusion of donor hearts for transplantation has received increasing interest, but the effects on cellular metabolism, myocyte necrosis, and myocardial edema are not well defined.                                                                              Pig hearts were instrumented with sonomicrometry crystals and left ventricular catheters. Left ventricular function was quantified by the pre-load-recruitable stroke work (PRSW) relationship. Hearts were arrested with Celsior solution with 5.5 mM 13C-glucose added, and removed and stored in cold solution (n = 4) or placed in a device providing continuous perfusion of this solution at 10 ml/100 g/min (n = 4). After 4 hours of storage, left atrial samples were frozen, extracted, and analyzed by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Hearts were then transplanted into recipient pigs and reperfused for 6 hours, with function measured hourly. At the end of the experiment, left ventricular water content and serum creatine kinase-MB isoenzyme levels were measured.                                                                              Baseline left ventricular function was similar in both groups. During reperfusion, the volume-axis intercept of the PRSW relationship was significantly lower in hearts stored with continuous perfusion (p <    0.05), suggesting reduced contractile impairment. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed a decrease in tissue lactate in hearts that received continuous perfusion. Serum creatine kinase-MB isoenzyme levels were higher hearts that had static storage (30.8 +/- 9.0 vs 13.2 +/- 2.7 ng/ml; p <    0.05). Left ventricular water content was similar in both groups (0.797 +/- 0.012 vs 0.796 +/- 0.014; p = 0.45).                                                                                      Donor hearts sustain less functional impairment after storage with continuous perfusion. This technique reduces tissue lactate accumulation and myocardial necrosis without increasing myocardial edema and appears promising as a method to improve results of cardiac transplantation."
4116389	"Management of late humoral rejection remains challenging, and DSA may persist. A case report illustrates how individual DSA titers using solid-phase-based assays may help to assess for accommodation. A male cystinosis patient received a cadaveric renal transplant at the age of 12 yr with a daclizumab, tacrolimus, MMF, and steroids-based immunosuppression. After three acute rejection episodes over the first eight months, interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IF/TA) was diagnosed on biopsy, while the immunosuppression was left unchanged with a high target exposure for both tacrolimus and MPA. One yr later, AMR type III (C4d and DSA positive) was treated with daily plasmapheresis, IVIG 100 mg/kg and pulse steroids 5 mg/kg. DSA (DR 53, DQ4, and DQ 2) were not responding until the plasma volume was increased to 2.5 plasma volumes. A second rise of creatinine confirmed worse humoral rejection; daily plasma exchange was resumed, and two doses of rituximab (375 mg/m(2)) were given. Subsequently, all DSA dropped, but only DR53 DSA remained unchanged, whereas the DQ antibodies rebounded to very strong titers. With a follow-up of over 120 days after recovery of the CD19 count, off all additional treatment and on identical immunosuppression with tacrolimus and MMF and prednisone, the patient's creatinine remained stable between 45 and 50 um while DQ DSA remain strong to very strong. We conclude that the patient is in a state of accommodation. DSA titers should be monitored when managing late humoral rejection."
1631147	"Arabidopsis thaliana COMATOSE (CTS) encodes an ABC transporter involved in peroxisomal import of substrates for β-oxidation. Various cts alleles and mutants disrupted in steps of peroxisomal β-oxidation have previously been reported to exhibit a severe block on seed germination. Oxylipin analysis on cts, acyl CoA oxidase1 acyl CoA oxidase2 (acx1 acx2), and keto acyl thiolase2 dry seeds revealed that they contain elevated levels of 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA), jasmonic acid (JA), and JA-Ile. Oxylipin and transcriptomic analysis showed that accumulation of these oxylipins occurs during late seed maturation in cts. Analysis of double mutants generated by crossing cts with mutants in the JA biosynthesis pathway indicate that OPDA, rather than JA or JA-Ile, contributes to the block on germination in cts seeds. We found that OPDA was more effective at inhibiting wild-type germination than was JA and that this effect was independent of CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 but was synergistic with abscisic acid (ABA). Consistent with this, OPDA treatment increased ABA INSENSITIVE5 protein abundance in a manner that parallels the inhibitory effect of OPDA and OPDA+ABA on seed germination. These results demonstrate that OPDA acts along with ABA to regulate seed germination in Arabidopsis."
2423299	"In this first of three lessons spanning the topic of Plant Nutrition, we examine primarily the energetics and mechanisms of nutrient uptake and transport. These processes are particularly well illustrated by an examination of the essential nutrient potassium (K), and the closely related element sodium (Na). We also examine the challenges associated with providing plants with sufficient K to support vigorous growth, and the detrimental effects of sodium accumulation in soils. Finally, we examine efforts to improve the salinity tolerance of crop plants."
1012106	"We have successfully treated chronic facial erosions in three boys with junctional epidermolysis bullosa. In each patient, keratinocytes were harvested from the roof of suction blisters created on clinically uninvolved skin. They were grown in tissue culture on collagen sponges and grafted onto facial erosions that were previously treated with 2% mupirocin ointment. This experimental antibiotic ointment has proved efficacy in eradicating cutaneous pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus from chronic wounds. In two patients, complete reepithelialization was achieved over 7 and 10 months, respectively, and partial reepithelialization occurred in another patient in whom treatment is ongoing. Epidermal autografts are a promising means for improving function and appearance in eroded skin caused by junctional epidermolysis bullosa."
4052526	"A new entity called ""implant periapical lesion"" has recently been described. This lesion could be the result of, for example, bone overheating, implant overloading, presence of a preexisting infection or residual root fragments and foreign bodies in the bone, contamination of the implant, or implant placement in an infected maxillary sinus. This case report describes a titanium implant that was placed in the maxillary premolar region. A fenestration involving the middle portion of the implant was present. After 7 months, the apical portion of the implant showed radiolucency. This lesion rapidly increased in size and a vestibular fistula appeared. A systemic course of antibiotics was not successful, and the implant was then removed. The histologic examination showed the presence of necrotic bone inside the antirotational hole of the implant. The etiology of the implant failure in this instance could possibly be related to bone overheating associated with an excessive tightening of the implant and compression of the bone chips inside the apical hole, producing subsequent necrosis."
1622056	"The role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC) is not well defined, with past studies showing conflicting results.                                                                                  We sought to determine if there is a significant association between HPV and cuSCC and whether cuSCC from immunosuppressed patients are more likely to carry HPV than cuSCC from immunocompetent patients.                                                                              We performed a systematic review and abstracted data from articles that included: skin samples by biopsy, HPV detection by polymerase chain reaction, and a minimum of 10 cases and 10 controls. Pooled effect size and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using random effects meta-analysis using the inverse variance method.                                                                              cuSCC were more likely to carry HPV than normal-appearing skin (pooled effect size [ES] 3.43, 95% confidence interval 1.97-5.98, P <    .0001) in all patients. An increase in HPV prevalence was found in tumors from immunosuppressed patients compared with immunocompetent patients (pooled ES 3.01, 95% confidence interval 2.00-4.52, P <    .0001).                                                                                      The greatest limitation is the heterogeneity of the studies included. The association of higher HPV prevalence in squamous cell carcinoma compared with normal-appearing skin does not imply causality.                                                                                     These results contribute to evidence that HPV is associated with cuSCC. Higher HPV burden in tumors from immunosuppressed patients compared with immunocompetent patients may have therapeutic implications."
6428208	"The structural, functional and in-silico studies of Dof transcription factor attempted so far reveals immense opportunity to analyze the plant genomes in terms of number of Dof genes and discuss in light of the evolution. The multiple functions of Dof genes needs to explored for crop improvement. Transcription factors play a very vital role in gene regulation at transcriptional level and are being extensively studied across phylas. In recent years, sequencing of plant genomes has led to genome-wide identification and characterizations of diverse types of plant-specific transcription factor gene family providing key insights into their structural and functional diversity. The DNA binding with one finger (Dof), a class belonging to C2H2-type zinc finger family proteins, is a plant-specific transcription factor having multiple roles such as seed maturation and germination, phytohormone and light-mediated regulation and plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Dof proteins are present across plant lineage, from green algae to higher angiosperm, and represent a unique class of transcription factor having bifunctional binding activities, with both DNA and proteins, to regulate the complex transcriptional machinery in plant cells. The structural and functional diversity of the Dof transcription factor family along with the bioinformatics analysis highlighting the phylogeny of Dof families is reviewed in light of its importance in plant biotechnology for crop improvement."
4840201	"The way in which congenital nevomelanocytic nevi (CNN) expand relative to anatomic region during growth is relevant to decisions about optimal timing for surgical excision and assessment for malignant change.                                                                                  Our purpose was to determine how CNN area expands relative to anatomic region during infancy and early childhood.                                                                              Forty-one small CNN in as many subjects were studied from the newborn period. Relative area (CNN area/anatomic region area) was derived for each measure. Proportionate expansion (PE), defined as change in relative area per unit time as a proportion of initial relative area, was calculated. Relative to anatomic region, area expansion of CNN is greater when PE is greater than 0, less when PE is less than 0, and at least double when PE is +1.0 or greater.                                                                              From the newborn period to last measure (2 to 71 months), PE ranged from -0.7 to +8.8 (median, +0.1). For 66% of CNN (27 of 41), PE was greater than 0. Nine of 39 CNN (15.4%) had PE values of +1.0 or greater during the first 6 months, compared with 1 of 26 cases (3.8%) for the interval beginning at or after 6 months.                                                                                     Disproportionately rapid area expansion of CNN may occur during early infancy, related to transient benign neoplasia, delayed pigmentation, and/or error of the methods used in the analysis."
2483906	"We introduced a plant selection marker, nptII, to the left of border A in the Agrobacterium Ti plasmid pTiA6. Infection of tobacco leaf discs with the modified Agrobacterium strain gave rise to kanamycin-resistant calli which grew in a hormone-dependent manner. Southern hybridization analysis of DNA isolated from four transformants indicated initiation of DNA transfer at or near border A and absence of T-DNA sequences. These results demonstrate that DNA transfer events starting at a left border on a native Ti plasmid and moving away from the T-DNA region occur and that they can be detected by designing a suitable selection strategy."

Of 48 patients evaluated after 30 weeks of treatment, 71% of patients from group A achieved Grade 3 or 4 repigmentation compared with 50% in group B. Significant difference was found between group A and B at the end of 30 weeks of treatment (p = 0.001)."
4652431	The diagnosis of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in patients under 20 years of age is extremely rare. We report five patients diagnosed before 20 years of age who illustrate the striking variations in clinical and histologic features as well as disease progression. We feel this information stresses the importance of multiple biopsies in young patients with chronic dermatoses.
3729565	"Incidence and mortality rates due to skin cancer are rising in most Western countries. Early detection of these tumours at a stage when they can be easily cured is the primary approach taken by many people wishing to deal with the problem. A primary prevention approach, that is, reduction in sunlight exposure, is being considered by an increasing number of organizations. The public health approach to primary prevention of skin cancer, including melanoma, requires an understanding of the role of sunlight in the production of these tumours. Despite a clear understanding of exactly how sunlight does this, there is enough epidemiological and laboratory evidence to suggest a broad approach to the problem. This includes reduction of sunlight exposure, particularly in childhood and adolescence. It also suggests the need to recommend avoidance of suntanning and particularly the excessive exposures that lead to sunburn. Widespread primary prevention public health programmes have been running in Australia for almost 20 years. The data measuring the effect of these programmes indicate a very large shift in knowledge attitudes and beliefs about sunlight exposure and suntans, and major shifts in behaviour. Suntans are no longer as popular as they were and people are reducing their sunlight exposure by a variety of methods encapsulated in Slip! Slop! Slap! Cohort analysis of the incidence rates for melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer show that the incidence of these tumours is levelling out in young people and is dropping in some instances. These are the people who were able to be influenced by the public health programmes in recent decades. Finally, following initial dramatic changes in all the behavioural variables related to the programme, a period of consolidation with continuing effort and more specific targeting will be required in the coming decades to maintain the improvement."
3744519	"In resurrection plants and yeast, trehalose has a function in stress protection, but the absence of measurable amounts of trehalose in other plants precludes such a function. The identification of a trehalose biosynthetic pathway in angiosperms raises questions on the function of trehalose metabolism in nonresurrection plants. We previously identified a mutant in the Arabidopsis trehalose biosynthesis gene AtTPS1. Plants homozygous for the tps1 mutation do not develop mature seeds (Eastmond et al., 2002). AtTPS1 expression analysis and the spatial and temporal activity of its promoter suggest that this gene is active outside the seed-filling stage of development as well. A generally low expression is observed in all organs analyzed, peaking in metabolic sinks such as flower buds, ripening siliques, and young rosette leaves. The arrested tps1/tps1 embryonic state could be rescued using a dexamethasone-inducible AtTPS1 expression system enabling generation of homozygous mutant plants. When depleted in AtTPS1 expression, such mutant plants show reduced root growth, which is correlated with a reduced root meristematic region. Moreover, tps1/tps1 plants are retarded in growth and remain generative during their lifetime. Absence of Trehalose-6-Phosphate Synthase 1 in Arabidopsis plants precludes transition to flowering."
6540698	"Everolimus (Certican) is a novel proliferation signal inhibitor with potent immunosuppressant effects that has been shown to prevent and reverse acute rejection in preclinical models of kidney, heart, and lung transplantation. These effects have been confirmed by clinical studies in which everolimus demonstrated comparable efficacy to azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil in heart and renal transplantation, respectively, when combined with full-dose cyclosporine (CsA; Neoral). Experimental studies have also shown that everolimus inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation and prevents neointimal thickening and transplant arteriosclerosis. Importantly, everolimus was shown to significantly reduce both the incidence and severity of cardiac allograft vasculopathy in recipients of heart transplants, which if confirmed in long-term studies, could provide a major advantage in these patients. Use of everolimus was also associated with lower rates of cytomegalovirus infection in both indications. Studies in which everolimus was combined with reduced-exposure CsA have demonstrated significantly improved renal function when compared with full-dose regimens, with no loss of efficacy. The results of preclinical and clinical studies with everolimus thus indicate that this novel proliferation signal inhibitor will be an important addition to the armamentarium by enhancing graft survival and minimizing toxicity."
6918688	"The prompt recognition of the clinical features of dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is important, but securing a definitive diagnosis requires further work-up. Recent advances in understanding of the immunologic basis for DH have led to the development and wider availability of serologic testing, which is rapidly becoming an essential part of the diagnosis and management of DH. Part II of this series will detail the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up for patients with DH, and will particularly focus on recent advances in the field."
6567891	"The purpose of this study was to further characterize acridine-photosensitized inhibition of mast cell degranulation. Acridine plus UVA radiation (320-400 nm) inhibited degranulation in response to antigen in IgE-sensitized rat serosal mast cells and in response to concanavalin A, which acts by a mechanism similar to antigen-IgE challenge. Removing oxygen from the incubation medium prevented the acridine-photosensitized inhibition of mast cell degranulation in response to 48/80. Acridine plus UVA radiation did not decrease mast cell ATP content, thus excluding inhibition of ATP production as a mechanism for photosensitized inhibition of mast cell degranulation. Although the viability of mast cells, as determined by uptake of trypan blue, was not affected 3 h after treatment with acridine plus UVA radiation, viability decreased by 6 h, and by 22 h 44% of the cells were nonviable. These results indicate that degranulation of mast cells by a variety of agents is inhibited by UVA plus acridine treatment, and that photosensitization requires oxygen and occurs before cytotoxicity."
9919107	"Endogenous ochronosis (EO) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder due to accumulation of oxidized and polymerized forms of homogentisic acid (HGA) in connective tissues, giving them a deep dark blue pigmentation.                                                                            Through a new Tunisian case of EO and a review of the literature, we aimed to define the epidemioclinical features of EO, its diagnostic criteria, and evolution.                                                                              Three hundred and forty patients were enrolled through 54 articles and four abstracts.                                                                                  A 35-year-old woman, born in consanguineous parents, presented with blue-grey patches of fingernails, first interdigital spaces, and ears with brown conjunctival pigmentation. Urine specimen turned dark on standing overnight. The diagnosis of EO was confirmed by urinary high levels of HGA. Investigations revealed radiologic signs of ochronotic arthropathy.                                                                                               EO is ubiquitary. Its prevalence was estimated at almost 6.5 cases/year. The mean age at diagnosis was 55.9 years (M/F: 1.85). Onset symptoms mainly consisted in cutaneous signs. Ochronotic arthropathy was the most frequently reported manifestation. Treatment was mainly symptomatic.                                                                                     EO is often revealed in adulthood mainly after the fourth decade. Urinary darkening is the first sign of the disease but is rarely reported as an onset sign. Skin signs are the alerting features. Ochronotic arthropathy is insidious but may be debilitating. No specific medical treatment of EO is available.                                                                                     Cutaneous manifestations are the hallmarks of OE. As vital organ involvement has been reported, close monitoring and continuous surveillance is warranted."
3407260	"Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is a frequent option in the treatment of liver diseases. During the cold ischemia period of the donor liver, there is an accumulation of metabolites that are potent inhibitors of the cytokine-inducible and endothelial nitric oxide synthase isoenzymes. We identified the presence of L-N-monomethylarginine and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) as the main inhibitors by means of analytic high-pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry techniques. An average ADMA concentration of 450 micromol/L was measured in the preservation medium of donor livers with poor outcomes after OLT. A statistically significant relationship was observed between the concentration of methylated arginine derivatives in the graft and liver function after OLT. These data suggest that measurement of methylated arginine, released after liver protein catabolism, might provide an indication of functional status of the liver that can help the development of strategies intended to improve graft viability."
6244518	"Skin roughness, color change, wrinkles and skin laxity are the main characteristics of aging skin. Dermatologists and plastic surgeons look for a treatment that will provide both epidermal resurfacing for the improvement of skin roughness and deep volumetric heating that will trigger collagen remodeling in the dermis to reduce wrinkles and skin laxity. These goals should be achieved with minimal pain and downtime.                                                                              The study included 10 subjects (Fitzpatrick's skin type 2-3) with Fitzpatrick wrinkle and elastosis scale of 5-8 (average 7.3). Treatment was done with the Fractional skin resurfacing handpiece of the EndyMed PRO multisource radiofrequency system (EndyMed Ltd, Cesarea, Israel). Treatment was repeated each month up to a total of three treatment sessions. Patients photographs were graded according to accepted scales by a board certified dermatologists. Patients' pain and satisfaction were scored using dedicated questionnaires. Doctors' satisfaction was also evaluated.                                                                              Post treatment skin erythema was noted in all treated patients, lasting up to 10 hours. Fifty six percent of patients reported no pain after treatment, and the rest (44%) reported minimal pain. All patients showed significant reduction in the Fitzpatrick wrinkle score. Average Fitzpatrick wrinkle score was 7.3 at baseline, 4.9 at 1 month after the first treatment, 4.2 at 1 month after the second treatment, and 4.1 at 1 month after the third treatment. The score was similar at 3 months after the third treatment with a score of 4.1. When asked at the end of three treatment sessions, all patients answered they will recommend the treatment to their friends (66% ""definitely yes"" and 33% ""yes""). When asked the same question 3 months after the end of treatment, all patients (100%) answered ""definitely yes""."
4587238	A series of tetrazolium salts were found to accept electrons more readily from succinate than malate even though the rate of oxygen uptake was similar with both substrates. This difference was explained by showing that all the tetrazolium salts tested caused a reduction in electron flow between NAD(+) and Cyt.b. The tetrazolium salts were also found to be able to uncouple phosphorylation from electron transport. The monotetrazolium salts causing complete uncoupling around 100 μmoles/litre and the ditetrazolium salts causing complete uncoupling around 20 μmoles/litre.
1427173	Dermatophyte and nondermatophyte fungi are ubiquitious in the envionment. This study demonstates the presence of dermatophyte fungi and saprophytic fungi contaminating step stools and flooring samples in office examination rooms. The use of protective coverings as well as other barriers will help to protect both patients and health care workers from acquiring nosocomial infection.
2204282	"Doppler ultrasound investigation was performed in the renal grafts of 86 patients with primary non-function following cadaveric renal transplantation. Pulsatility Index, defined as: [formula: see text] was assessed to examine its predictive use in the diagnosis of rejection episodes as judged by a retrospective analysis of histological data. Altogether 415 Doppler examinations and 228 renal biopsies were performed. In our population the incidence of rejection was 57%. Using a pulsatility index (PI) >    1.8 to be indicative of rejection, the sensitivity of our test was 68% for vascular rejection and 65% for all rejection episodes. The specificity was 25%. We conclude that Doppler ultrasound cannot replace the need for transplant renal biopsy in patients with primary non-function."
5100356	"Patients suffering from high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) secondary to MDS (sAML) are characterized by poor response to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy. The purpose of our prospective single-center study was to examine the safety and efficacy of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) following a sequential conditioning regimen as first-line therapy for previously untreated patients with high-risk MDS or sAML. Between November 2003 and June 2010, 30 patients (20 high-risk MDS, 10 sAML) received fludarabine (4 × 30 mg/m(2)), amsacrine (4 × 100 mg/m(2)), and Ara-C (4 × 2 g/m(2), FLAMSA). After 2 to 3 days of rest, patients received high-dose melphalan alone (200 mg/m(2) for patients with an age <   50 years, 150 mg/m(2) for patients with an age between 50 and 60 years, and 100 mg/m(2) for patients with an age >   60 years; n = 24) or melphalan and thiotepa (10 mg/kg, Mel/Thio, n = 6). Following these high-dose conditioning regimens, a median number of 7.7 × 10(6) CD34(+) cells/kg body weight (range: 2.9 × 10(6)-17.2 × 10(6)) were transplanted from 13 related or 17 unrelated donors. Antithymocyte globulin (Fresenius 30-60 mg/kg) as well as tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil were used for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. All patients except 1 with primary graft failure achieved complete remission after HSCT. After a median follow-up time of 28 months (range: 7-81), 21 patients (70%) were alive and free of disease. Overall, 4 patients relapsed. At 2 years, overall survival, event-free survival, and treatment-related mortality were 70%, 63%, and 30%, respectively. Because of undue toxicity, thiotepa is no longer part of the conditioning regimen. Our results add to the body of evidence that a FLAMSA-based sequential conditioning therapy is effective for previously untreated patients with high-risk MDS or sAML."

1799940	"The value of folate supplementation in methotrexate (MTX)-treated patients remains controversial.                                                                                   To determine the effect of folic acid (FA) on the efficacy of MTX and the frequency of side-effects associated with MTX therapy.                                                                              A 12-week double-blind clinical trial was conducted in patients with psoriasis stable on their long-term MTX doses but not receiving FA. They were randomized into two arms of either FA 5 mg or placebo daily. MTX doses were not changed throughout the study. Patients were monitored every 3 weeks by the same observer. Assessments included Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), a visual analogue scale (VAS) of patients' perception of their psoriasis severity and the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Adverse events were systematically recorded. Haematological and biochemical monitoring was performed.                                                                              Twenty-two patients with psoriasis were recruited. Age, sex and weekly MTX doses were similar in both groups. All 22 patients completed the study. The mean PASI in the FA group increased from 6.4 at baseline to 10.8 at 12 weeks. In the placebo group the mean PASI fell from 9.8 at baseline to 9.2 at 12 weeks. The mean change from baseline in the FA group was 4.4 vs. -0.6 in the placebo group (P <    0.05). Similar trends were observed in the changes in VAS and in the DLQI and differences between the groups were significant for both these parameters (P <    0.05). Few adverse effects were reported.                                                                                      This study suggests that supplementation with FA during long-term MTX treatment reduces the efficacy of MTX in the control of psoriasis. Due to the relatively small sample size and short duration of this study, no conclusions can be drawn regarding the possibility that FA may reduce the side-effects of MTX."
8396642	"Skin cancers pose a significant public health problem in high-risk populations. We have prospectively monitored basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) incidence in a Queensland community over a 10-y period by recording newly treated lesions, supplemented by skin examination surveys. Age-standardized incidence rates of people with new histologically confirmed BCC were 2787 per 100,000 person-years at risk (pyar) among men and 1567 per 100,000 pyar among women, and corresponding tumor rates were 5821 per 100,000 pyar and 2733 per 100,000 pyar, respectively. Incidence rates for men with new SCC were 944 per 100,000 pyar and for women 675 per 100,000 pyar; tumor rates were 1754 per 100,000 pyar and 846 per 100,000 pyar, respectively. Incidence rates of BCC tumors but not SCC tumors varied noticeably according to method of surveillance, with BCC incidence rates based on skin examination surveys around three times higher than background treatment rates. This was mostly due to an increase in diagnosis of new BCC on sites other than the head and neck, arms, and hands associated with skin examination surveys and little to do with advancing the time of diagnosis of BCC on these sites as seen by a return to background rates following the examination surveys. We conclude that BCC that might otherwise go unreported are detected during skin examination surveys and thus that such skin cancer screening can influence the apparent burden of skin cancer."
7087299	"In view of the presence of the polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) chemoattractant Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) in the surface scale of the psoriatic lesion and the known therapeutic effect of phototherapy in psoriasis, the photostability of LTB4 was investigated. LTB4 was irradiated with dosages of UVB (290-320 nm) ranging from 100-1500 mJ cm-2 and with dosages of UVA (320-400 nm) ranging from 5-40 J cm-2. Topical application of UVB irradiated LTB4 to the forearm skin of normal volunteers showed a marked reduction in cutaneous erythema, paralleled histologically by reduced transepidermal PMN migration when compared with sites of application of unirradiated and UVA irradiated LTB4. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) demonstrated a dose-dependent photodegradation of LTB4 by UVB irradiation. UVA irradiation produced no such effect. The wavelengths responsible lie within the absorption spectrum of LTB4. In vitro chemotaxis studies, using an under agarose technique, showed a statistically significant reduction in the migration of PMN from both psoriatic and non-psoriatic subjects to the UVB irradiated LTB4 compared with the unirradiated LTB4, whilst UVA irradiated LTB4 produced a normal PMN chemotactic response."

6785320	"Genetic manipulation of pancreatic islets before transplantation has the potential to alter cellular immunity as well as islet function. The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility of gene transfer to islets, using replication-defective adenoviral vectors. Newborn mouse islets were infected with AdHCMVsp1LacZ vector encoding Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase (beta-gal). Islets were cocultured with vector, at virus-to-target cell ratios of 10:1, for 1 hr. Gene transfer was assessed by specific histochemical stain for beta-gal (X-gal). Islet DNA and RNA were analyzed by Southern and PCR for beta-gal and adeno sequences, and recombinant protein production by western and ONPG assays. Islet integrity after gene transfer was assessed by static incubations and transplantation to nondiabetic and to diabetic mice. Southern analysis and PCR confirmed the presence of E coli beta-galactosidase and the E4 adeno DNA in infected islets, but not in controls. Reverse-transcription PCR and western analysis demonstrated expression and protein production of inserted E coli beta-galactosidase, but not E4 message. Insulin release in response to static incubations was unimpaired in infected islets. Syngeneic islet grafts stained positively for insulin for up to 7 days. Transplanted, genetically manipulated islets functioned similarly to control islets in reversing murine drug-induced diabetes. Thus, gene transfer into islets can be accomplished using adenovirus-based vectors. The capacity of this virus to infect non-dividing cells allows insertion of cDNA into pancreatic islets, with potential application to the transplant setting."

It is classically considered a male-lethal disorder leading to recurrent miscarriages of male fetuses. We report a rare case of a surviving baby boy with the classic clinical features of incontinentia pigmenti that can be explained by Klinefelter syndrome."
9213314	"Conifers like Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) have a complicated root system consisting of morphologically and anatomically different root types, of which the short roots have a very limited ability to elongate. Short roots have an important role in nature since they are able to establish ectomycorrhizal symbiosis, in which the growth of fungal mycelium between the epidermal cells and in the intercellular space between cortical cells leads to formation of dichotomous short roots, which may, through further splitting of the meristem, form coralloid root structures. Dichotomous short roots have been suggested to result from changes in either auxin or ethylene concentrations due to the fungal growth inside the root. NPA, the inhibitor of polar auxin transport, enhances the dichotomization of P. sylvestris short root tips similarly to the fungal growth in the root, thus confirming that auxin plays a role in short root morphogenesis. Ethylene is also known to have an important role in the regulation of root morphogenesis. In future the research dealing with the root system and ectomycorrhiza development in P. sylvestris must take into account that both auxin and ethylene are involved and that there is no contradiction in obtaining the same phenotype with both hormones. The expression analysis of PIN proteins, auxin efflux carriers, could give valuable information about the role of auxin transport in regulating the root growth and morphogenesis of coniferous root system and mycorrhiza."
7433969	Three cases of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) with extensive invasion are described. The first two patients had meningeal and cerebral involvement with exposure of their dural meninges following full thickness skull erosion. The third patient had bilateral orbital and optic nerve involvement resulting in complete blindness. All three patients subsequently died from their disease.
2012823	"Detailed studies on the biology of Langerhans cells (LC), which account for only 1-3% of all epidermal cells, require isolation from their cutaneous symbionts. Several techniques of LC isolation have been reported, including positive enrichment with mAb coupled to immunomagnetic beads. The disadvantage of this technique is the size of the beads (approximately 2-5 microns), which can interfere with subsequent phenotypic and functional analyses. This limitation prompted us to test whether paramagnetic microbeads (15 nm) employed by the MACS system could be used to purify LC from human skin. To isolate fresh LC (fLC), epidermal cell suspensions (EC) were stained with anti-CD1a mAb and with appropriate secondary reagents conjugated to microbeads and to FITC. They were then passed over a separation column and exposed to a strong magnetic field. Thereafter both CD1a-depleted and CD1a-enriched cells were collected. Cultured LC (cLC) were isolated by staining 72-h cultured EC with anti-HLA-DR mAb followed by the same isolation procedure. Using this technique, we could routinely isolate viable EC that were 45-88% CD1a+ or HLA-DR+ as determined by FACS. Two-color FACS analysis demonstrated the majority of MACS-purified cells to be CD1a+/HLA-DR+, indicating that they were indeed LC. By transmission electron microscopy (TEM), the MACS-purified CD1a+/HLA-DR+ cells showed typical ultrastructural characteristics of LC. Furthermore, MACS-purified fLC or cLC were functionally intact, because they stimulated the proliferation of alloreactive T cells in a primary, one-way, mixed epidermal cell leukocyte reaction (MECLR). We conclude that MACS-separation is an efficient and rapid method to isolate human fLC and cLC of high purity and unimpaired function."
3937046	"Plants that utilize the highly efficient C4 pathway of photosynthesis typically possess kranz-type leaf anatomy that consists of two morphologically and functionally distinct photosynthetic cell types, the bundle sheath (BS) and mesophyll (M) cells. These two cell types differentially express many genes that are required for C4 capability and function. In mature C4 leaves, the plastidic rbcL gene, encoding the large subunit of the primary CO2 fixation enzyme Rubisco, is expressed specifically within BS cells. Numerous studies have demonstrated that BS-specific rbcL gene expression is regulated predominantly at post-transcriptional levels, through the control of translation and mRNA stability. The identification of regulatory factors associated with C4 patterns of rbcL gene expression has been an elusive goal for many years.                                                                              RLSB, encoded by the nuclear RLSB gene, is an S1-domain RNA binding protein purified from C4 chloroplasts based on its specific binding to plastid-encoded rbcL mRNA in vitro. Co-localized with LSU to chloroplasts, RLSB is highly conserved across many plant species. Most significantly, RLSB localizes specifically to leaf bundle sheath (BS) cells in C4 plants. Comparative analysis using maize (C4) and Arabidopsis (C3) reveals its tight association with rbcL gene expression in both plants. Reduced RLSB expression (through insertion mutation or RNA silencing, respectively) led to reductions in rbcL mRNA accumulation and LSU production. Additional developmental effects, such as virescent/yellow leaves, were likely associated with decreased photosynthetic function and disruption of associated signaling networks.                                                                                      Reductions in RLSB expression, due to insertion mutation or gene silencing, are strictly correlated with reductions in rbcL gene expression in both maize and Arabidopsis. In both plants, accumulation of rbcL mRNA as well as synthesis of LSU protein were affected. These findings suggest that specific accumulation and binding of the RLSB binding protein to rbcL mRNA within BS chloroplasts may be one determinant leading to the characteristic cell type-specific localization of Rubisco in C4 plants. Evolutionary modification of RLSB expression, from a C3 ""default"" state to BS cell-specificity, could represent one mechanism by which rbcL expression has become restricted to only one cell type in C4 plants."
7073812	"This is an unusual presentation of lepromatous leprosy (LL) in a young boy, 12 years of age. The study forms part of a large scale immunotherapeutic trial with Mycobacterium w (M.w) antileprosy vaccine. The trial is being conducted in two major hospitals in New Delhi, India.                                                                                            This patient presented with three lesions: one on each forearm and the third on the left leg. He was classified initially as borderline tuberculoid leprosy. Slit-skin smears and histopathology from the lesions proved the diagnosis to be lepromatous leprosy with a bacterial index (BI) 6+. The initial lepromin test was negative. The patient was treated with chemo-immunotherapy (standard multidrug therapy and immunotherapy with Mycobacterium w vaccine).                                                                              Investigations after 1 year (15 months) of multi-drug therapy and three doses of vaccine, showed a remarkable fall in the BI from 6 to 0 in the lesions, a lepromin positivity of 5 mm, and a histological upgrading from lepromatous leprosy to borderline tuberculoid. Immunologic studies at 15 months revealed a good LTT response and high levels of cytokines, specifically IL-2 and IFN-gamma.

It stresses the importance of slit-smear and biopsy in all patients of leprosy, and it highlights the upgrading observed on administration of chemo-immunotherapy."
7267978	"The objective of the present study was to analyze hepatic mitochondrial function in patients with familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) undergoing cadaveric donor orthotopic liver transplantation. From February 2005 to May 2007, eight patients with FAP, ranging in age from 34 to 41 years and with Model for End-Stage Liver Disease scores ranging from 24 to 29. Underwent orthotopic transplantation using a liver from a deceased donor by the piggyback method. Immediately before beginning the recipient hepatectomy in a patient with FAP, a biopsy was obtained for analysis of mitochondrial function (FAP group). The control group consisted of 15 patients undergoing hepatic surgery to treat small tumors of the liver. Mitochondrial respiration was determined on the basis of oxygen consumption by energized mitochondria using a polarographic method. The membrane potential of the mitochondria was determined spectrofluorometrically. Data were analyzed statistically by the Mann-Whitney test, with the level of significance set at 5%. State 3 and 4 values, respiratory control ratio, and membrane potential were 47 +/- 8 versus 28 +/- 10 natoms O/min/mg protein (P <    .05); 14 +/- 3 vs 17 +/- 7 nat.O/min/mg.prot.mit.

1593502	"Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), a heritable multi-system disorder, is caused by mutations in the ABCC6 gene primarily expressed in the liver. Recent analysis of cultured fibroblasts from patients with PXE has suggested compensatory alterations in the expression of the ABCA-subfamily of genes. We have now determined by quantitative RT-PCR the level of expression of Abca-family of genes in a mouse model of PXE developed by targeted ablation of Abcc6. The results indicated variable levels of mRNA for different Abca genes in the liver; however, only one of them, Abca4, was significantly, ∼6.5-fold, upregulated in the Abcc6(-/-) mice in comparison with wild-type mice. In the same mice, Abca4 was not upregulated in the eyes or the kidney, suggesting that the upregulation of Abca4 in the liver is a tissue-specific compensatory consequence of the 'knock-out' of Abcc6."
5558118	"Fibroblast contamination can make establishing primary melanoma cell cultures from native biopsies a major challenge, due to fibroblasts overgrowing the melanoma cells. Standard protocols therefore enrich for highly proliferative melanoma cells that grow well in vitro but may not represent the full range of in vivo tumor heterogeneity. Here we apply conditional methods that more effectively retrieve melanoma cells by differential trypsinization or by inducing fibroblast senescence through contact inhibition, serum starvation or deprivation of adhesion. Simple mixing experiments of melanoma and fibroblast cells demonstrated the efficacy of the new protocols in retrieving slow-growing melanoma cells. Applying our protocols to 20 cultures that had failed to grow by conventional methods, we could retrieve 12 (60%) validated melanoma cell cultures. Further application of the protocols in the live-cell biobank of 124 early passage cultures significantly improved recovery rates from 13% using standard protocols to 70% overall for the new workflow."
2459613	"The modern surgical era of vascularized pancreas transplantation (PTX) began with the systemic-bladder drainage technique. According to International Pancreas Transplant Registry (IPTR) data, most PTX procedures are performed with systemic venous delivery of insulin and either bladder (systemic bladder) or enteric (systemic-enteric) drainage of the exocrine secretions. Since 1995 the number of PTX procedures performed with primary enteric drainage has increased dramatically, accounting for more than 70% of cases since 2001. Despite an evolution in exocrine drainage, the proportion of enteric drained PTXs with portal venous delivery of insulin (portal enteric drainage) has remained low, representing about 20% of cases. In recent IPTR analyses no differences were reported in short-term outcomes according to surgical technique. Coincident with more physiologic implantation techniques, the surgical complication rate has decreased to 10% to 20%. Experience with donor and recipient selection can reduce morbidity, inasmuch as risk factors for surgical complications include prolonged pre-transplantation peritoneal dialysis, donor or recipient BMI body mass index >   28 kg/m2, donor or recipient age older than 45 years, cerebrovascular cause of donor brain death, prolonged preservation, and prior abdominal surgery in the recipient. New techniques include simultaneous living donor kidney and deceased donor PTX, gastroduodenal artery revascularization, laparoscopic living donor nephrectomy and distal pancreatectomy, en bloc kidney and pancreas transplantation, P-E drainage with venting jejunostomy, retroperitoneal PTX with P-E drainage, and unusual vascular grafts. In the future the emphasis will shift from short-term surgical to long-term medical outcomes as the ultimate measure of success."

IgG alone has been demonstrated to induce acantholysis in some experimental conditions. The role of the complement system in blister formation in PV remains controversial. We describe four consecutive patients with new-onset PV. The acantholytic process occurred in the lower epidermis and colocalized with deposition of complement C3 and the membrane attack complex C5b-9. The colocalization of complement deposition with the acantholytic process in the lower epidermis supports a role for the complement system in blister formation in PV."

Allo-SCT recipients from Jan 2000-Dec 2009 were included and patients who underwent endoscopy and gut biopsy for G-GVHD were identified. Four hundred and fifty children (0-18 years) underwent allo-SCT during the study period. Seventy-nine (17.5%) patients underwent endoscopy and biopsy. At least stage II was required for skin involvement. Forty nine patients had G-GVHD and 30 had combined, GS-GVHD. The majority of patients received CsA and MTX for GVHD prophylaxis. Sixty-seven percent of patients with GS-GVHD had grade III-IV while only 31% had grade III-IV in the G-GVHD group. Median follow-up was 6.3 years (range 3.6-11.9 years). Relapse rate was similar in both the groups. However, children with G-GVHD had a significantly higher risk of dying from GVHD related complications (37% vs 16%) resulting in superior survival for those with skin involvement (79% vs 49% P=0.02). Extension of G-GVHD to the skin may suggest a better outcome."
5850400	"Kinematic analysis has provided important insights into the biology of growth by revealing the distribution of expansion within growing organs. Modern methods of kinematic analysis have made use of new image-tracking algorithms and computer-assisted evaluation, but these methods have yet to be adapted for examination of growth in a variety of plant species or for analysis of graviresponse. Therefore, a new image-analysis program, KineRoot, was developed to study spatio-temporal patterns of growth and curvature of roots. Graphite particles sprinkled on the roots create random patterns that can be followed by image analysis. KineRoot tracks the displacement of patterns created by the graphite particles over space and time using three search algorithms. Following pattern tracking, the edges of the roots are identified automatically by an edge detection algorithm that provides root diameter and root midline. Local growth rate of the root is measured by projecting the tracked points on the midline. From the shape of the root midline, root curvature is calculated. By combining curvature measurement with root diameter, the differential growth ratio between the greater and lesser curvature edges of a bending root is calculated. KineRoot is capable of analyzing a large number of images to generate local root growth and root curvature data over several hours, permitting kinematic analysis of growth and gravitropic responses for a variety of root types."
7295708	"Combinations of rifampin and clindamycin or rifampin, metronidazole, and moxifloxcin have been reported as effective treatments for hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) Hurley Stage 1 and Hurley Stage 2.  Clinical trials suggest that for stage 1 and mild stage 2 HS, clindamycin 300 mg twice daily and rifampin 300 mg twice daily for 10 weeks can substantially abate HS in ~80% of cases and remit HS in ~50% of cases.  Another study notes use of rifampin-moxifloxacin-metronidazole given for 6 weeks, dosed as rifampin (10 mg/kg once daily), moxifloxacin (400 mg daily), and metronidazole (500 mg thrice daily) with the metronidazole stopped at week 6.   Rifampin and moxifloxacin were continued if the HS improved and side effects did not occur.  Using this triple antibiotic regimen remission occurred in 100% Hurley Stage 1, 80% Hurly Stage 2, and 16.7 % of Hurley Stage 3 HS.   The author typically gives HS clindamycin 300 mg and rifampin 300 mg, each twice daily, for 10 weeks and assesses if remission has occurred.  If the patient has not achieved remission the author continues the regimen as long as the patient's clinical status continues to improve without side effects.  The reasons why rifampin is so effective against HS have not been fully defined and might involve rifampin's (1) antibacterial effects (2) effects on bacterial biofilms (3) anti-inflammatory effects (4) effects against granulomas (5) and immunomodulatory effects on neutrophils.  It is notable that rifampin, although not first line, is an effective treatment for Clostridium difficile, a pathogen that arises during treatment with clindamycin.  Thus, rifampin enhances safety when rifampin and clindamycin are combined for the treatment of HS."
8632170	"A patient with IgG-kappa-associated subcorneal pustular dermatosis (Sneddon-Wilkinson disease) refractory to dapsone, etretinate, and plasma exchange was successfully treated with corticosteroids. A study of neutrophils from both blood and pustules was carried out before and during treatment. Levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha were measured in serum, pustules, content, and supernatant of monocytes. The results suggest that a hyperactivation of neutrophils in the skin is due at least partly to excessive production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha."

2159580	"The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the dimensional changes of bioactive glass (BG) that occur after sinus bone grafting using a modified osteotome technique and simultaneous implant placement.                                                                              Seventy-six subjects received 87 implants with a modified osteotome sinus elevation technique using BG bone graft and simultaneous implant placement. The radiographs taken at the time of implant placement and at the time of implant uncovery were retrospectively evaluated to assess the degree of BG dimensional changes.                                                                              Thirty-six subjects with 44 implants were included in the study. A 24.6% significant reduction (P <    0.0001) of the apical height of the BG from the apex of the implant occurred during the 6-month healing period. There was no significant correlation between the extent of sinus floor elevation, healing time, and the vertical distance the implant penetrated into the sinus with the degree of the dimensional changes of the bone graft.                                                                                      This study demonstrated that BG had a dimensional change reduction of 24.6% after 6 months of healing time."
4793496	"A 55-year-old woman presented with a 3-year history of recurrent episodes of pruritic cellulitis-like erythematous plaques, mostly located on the limbs. Simultaneously, fever, malaise and peripheral eosinophilia were noted. The clinical diagnosis of eosinophilic cellulitis (also known as Well's syndrome) was supported by the histopathological finding of typical ""flame figures"". Treatment with dapsone was initiated at a dose of 50 mg per day. After one year of follow-up the patient was relapse-free. Eosinophilic cellulitis is an uncommon, recurrent inflammatory skin disease. The management is often a challenge, due to the frequent need for long-term therapy. Dapsone is an effective and safe treatment option."
9425631	"Lentigo maligna (LM) and lentigo maligna melanoma (LMM) can be difficult to manage surgically. Predetermined margins can be inadequate because of subclinical spread, or can affect function when margins are adjacent to the eye or mouth.                                                                            To describe our 5-year experience in Nottingham of using the staged square procedure (Johnson square) in excising difficult facial LM and LMM.                                                                              The square procedure is a staged technique useful for ill-defined lesions and for lesions that have a high recurrence rate due to subclinical spread. It uses paraffin wax-embedded peripheral vertical sections for margin control, ensuring complete clearance as the surgical margins are usually examined at distances of 2-5 mm from the periphery of the lesion.                                                                              We treated 21 patients with LM or LMM with the staged square procedure over a 5-year period. Of the 21 patients, 10 needed only one stage of surgery, 6 needed two stages, 3 needed three stages and 2 needed four stages. To date, there has been only one recurrence, which was of an extensive lesion that crossed the medial canthus, making margin control impossible because of the anatomical limitations.                                                                                      The staged square procedure is an effective treatment for LM and LMM. It attempts to conserve tissue while ensuring a higher clearance rate. This offers favourable cosmetic outcomes and better prognosis, especially for facial LM and LMM."
4127128	"Re-examination of published data from affected families with pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) described in the literature between 1896 and 1968 supported the concept of clinical and genetic heterogeneity. There was clinical evidence for two autosomal dominant and one recessive type, although only a single patient with recessive type II was described. Examination of the individual pedigrees supported both autosomal dominant and recessive patterns of inheritance. The pooled genetic data were less helpful because they were so highly selected. (They had been reported in the literature.) Even so the dominant type II data fitted the hypothesis, whilst the type I and recessive groups were near the expected values. The clinical properties of the groups corresponded closely to the recent British (Pope, 1973) survey. In general, the dominant type I group showed classical cutaneous changes, vascular complications were common and the chief ophthalmic complication was a severe choroidoretinitis. The dominant type II group, in contrast, has an atypical macular rash, or sometimes no rash at all, no vascular complications and very mild retinal changes. Choroidoretinitis was rare and peau d'orange patterns and prominent choroidal vessels common. The recessive group was of intermediate severity."
4756752	"All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) has been tried for the treatment and prevention of a number of epithelial cancers. However, the precise mechanism by which ATRA inhibits the growth of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) remains elusive.                                                                             To determine the suppressive effects of ATRA on the human cSCC cell line SCL-1, and explore the possible mechanisms involved.                                                                              SCL-1 cells were treated with ATRA, then cell proliferation was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, while apoptosis and cell cycle progression were analysed by flow cytometry. Protein levels of cell-cycle regulatory proteins and the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Jun kinase (JNK) were detected by western blotting analysis. Transcriptional activity of activator protein (AP)-1 was examined by luciferase reporter assay.                                                                              ATRA inhibited the proliferation of SCL-1 cells and had modest proapoptotic effects. ATRA also induced G1 cell-cycle arrest, inhibited the expression of cyclin D1/cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)4 and cyclinE/CDK2, and increased the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27. In addition, ATRA significantly decreased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and JNK1/2, and inhibited AP-1 transcriptional activity.                                                                                      ATRA induces cell-cycle arrest in human cSCC cells by inhibiting the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-AP1 pathway, and could be effective in the prevention and chemotherapy of human cSCC."
9970164	"The extensively studied Arabidopsis phytoalexin deficient 4 (AtPAD4) gene plays an important role in Arabidopsis disease resistance; however, the function of its sequence ortholog in rice is unknown. Here, we show that rice OsPAD4 appears not to be the functional ortholog of AtPAD4 in host-pathogen interactions, and that the OsPAD4 encodes a plasma membrane protein but that AtPAD4 encodes a cytoplasmic and nuclear protein. Suppression of OsPAD4 by RNA interference (RNAi) increased rice susceptibility to the biotrophic pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), which causes bacteria blight disease in local tissue. OsPAD4-RNAi plants also show compromised wound-induced systemic resistance to Xoo. The increased susceptibility to Xoo was associated with reduced accumulation of jasmonic acid (JA) and phytoalexin momilactone A (MOA). Exogenous application of JA complemented the phenotype of OsPAD4-RNAi plants in response to Xoo. The following results suggest that OsPAD4 functions differently than AtPAD4 in response to pathogen infection. First, OsPAD4 plays an important role in wound-induced systemic resistance, whereas AtPAD4 mediates systemic acquired resistance. Second, OsPAD4-involved defense signaling against Xoo is JA-dependent, but AtPAD4-involved defense signaling against biotrophic pathogens is salicylic acid-dependent. Finally, OsPAD4 is required for the accumulation of terpenoid-type phytoalexin MOA in rice-bacterium interactions, but AtPAD4-mediated resistance is associated with the accumulation of indole-type phytoalexin camalexin."
1711761	"Nine plasma cell myeloma patients spontaneously developed histologically proven autologous graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) limited predominantly to the gastrointestinal tract within 1 month of initial autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT) using high-dose melphalan conditioning. All recipients responded promptly to systemic and nonabsorbable oral corticosteroid therapy. All patients previously received systemic therapy with thalidomide, lenalidomide, or bortezomib before AHCT. Using enzymatic amplification staining-enhanced flow cytometry, we evaluated expression of selected transcription regulators, pathway molecules, and surface receptors on samples of the infused hematopoietic cell grafts. We demonstrated significantly enhanced expression of GATA-2, CD130, and CXCR4 on CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells of affected patients compared with 42 unaffected AHCT controls. These 3 overexpressed markers have not been previously implicated in autologous GVHD. Although we did not specifically evaluate T cells, we postulate that exposure over time to the various immunomodulating therapies used for induction treatment affected not only the CD34(+) cells but also T cells or relevant T cell subpopulations capable of mediating GVHD. After infusion, the affected hematopoietic progenitor cells then encounter a host that has been further altered by the high-dose melphalan preparative regimen; such a situation leads to the syndrome. These surface markers could be used to develop a model to predict development of this syndrome. Autologous GVHD potentially is a serious complication of AHCT and should be considered in plasma cell myeloma patients with otherwise unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms in the immediate post-AHCT period. Prompt recognition of this condition and protracted treatment with nonabsorbable or systemic corticosteroids or the combination may lead to resolution."
5542475	"Rape seeds primed with -1.2 MPa polyethylene glycol 6000 showed improved germination performance. To better understand the beneficial effect of osmopriming on seed germination, a global expression profiling method was used to compare, for the first time, transcriptomic and proteomic data for osmoprimed seeds at the crucial phases of priming procedure (soaking, drying), whole priming process and subsequent germination. Brassica napus was used here as a model to dissect the process of osmopriming into its essential components. A total number of 952 genes and 75 proteins were affected during the main phases of priming and post-priming germination. Transcription was not coordinately associated with translation resulting in a limited correspondence between mRNAs level and protein abundance. Soaking, drying and final germination of primed seeds triggered distinct specific pathways since only a minority of genes and proteins were involved in all phases of osmopriming while a vast majority was involved in only one single phase. A particular attention was paid to genes and proteins involved in the transcription, translation, reserve mobilization, water uptake, cell cycle and oxidative stress processes."

4419675	"In this study we analyzed the role of CCL2, a member of the chemokine family, in early graft damage. Using simultaneous kidney-pancreas transplantation (SPK) as a model, we showed that brain death significantly increases circulating CCL2 levels in humans. We found that in such situations, high donor CCL2 levels (measured before organ recovery and at the onset of cold preservation) correlate with increased postreperfusion release of CCL2 by both the graft and recipient throughout the week following transplantation (n = 28). In a retrospective study of 77 SPK recipients, we found a significant negative association between high donor levels of CCL2 and graft survival. Decreased survival in these patients is related to early posttransplant complications, including a higher incidence of pancreas thrombosis and delayed kidney function. Taken together our data indicate that high CCL2 levels in the donor serum predict both an increase in graft/recipient CCL2 production and poor graft survival. This suggests that the severity of the inflammatory response induced by brain death influences the posttransplant inflammatory response, independent of subsequent ischemia and reperfusion."
5649490	"Seed dormancy in Nicotiana plumbaginifolia is characterized by an abscisic acid accumulation linked to a pronounced germination delay. Dormancy can be released by 1 year after-ripening treatment. Using a cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism (cDNA-AFLP) approach we compared the gene expression patterns of dormant and after-ripened seeds, air-dry or during one day imbibition and analyzed 15,000 cDNA fragments. Among them 1020 were found to be differentially regulated by dormancy. Of 412 sequenced cDNA fragments, 83 were assigned to a known function by search similarities to public databases. The functional categories of the identified dormancy maintenance and breaking responsive genes, give evidence that after-ripening turns in the air-dry seed to a new developmental program that modulates, at the RNA level, components of translational control, signaling networks, transcriptional control and regulated proteolysis."
2675197	"Molecular signalling pathways delineating the induction of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) by ultraviolet radiation (UVR) are currently well-defined; however, the effects of UVR on epigenetic mechanisms of MMP induction are not as well understood. In this study, we examined solar-simulated UVR (ssUVR)-induced gene expression changes and alterations to histone methylation in the promoters of MMP1 and MMP3 in primary human dermal fibroblasts (HDF). Gene expression changes, including the increased expression of MMP1 and MMP3, were observed using Affymetrix GeneChip arrays and confirmed by qRT-PCR. Using ChIP-PCR, we showed for the first time that in HDF irradiated with 12 J/cm(2) ssUVR, the H3K4me3 transcriptional activating mark increased and the H3K9me2 transcriptional silencing mark decreased in abundance in promoters, correlating with the observed elevation of MMP1 and MMP3 mRNA levels following ssUVR exposure. Changes in mRNA levels due to a single exposure were transient and decreased 5 days after exposure."

We sought to develop a measurement tool (Alopecia Areata Progression Index, AAPI) for the evaluation of overall hair loss activity in AA patients with pigmented hair.                                                                              The scalp surface area was divided into 4 quadrants. In each quadrant, hair loss activity was scored on the basis of the percentage of alopecic area, clinical findings associated with hair loss. The AAPI was measured in 17 patients with different severities of AA.                                                                              Interobserver and intraobserver reliabilities were assessed by 4 investigators. A significant correlation of the total AAPI was found among the 4 investigators. In addition, intraobserver reliability was excellent, and interobserver reliability was statistically reliable.                                                                                     The AAPI seems to represent a system capable of truly quantifying overall hair loss activity in AA patients with different severity, demonstrating trustworthy interobserver and intraobserver reliability."
5428277	"Skin biopsy specimens and discolored fingernails from minocycline-treated patients were examined by light and electron microscopy, histochemistry, and energy-dispersive x-ray analysis. Both hyperpigmented and adjacent normally pigmented skin samples contained pigment-laden macrophages in the dermis, although these cells were more numerous in the hyperpigmented skin samples. Elemental analysis showed that both pigment deposits and stratum corneum of hyperpigmented skin samples contained iron and calcium. Discolored areas of fingernails from a minocycline-treated patient also contained iron and calcium. Both skin and nail discoloration were possibly due to the presence of an iron chelate of minocycline and/or quinoid derivatives of minocycline. The presence of iron-containing pigment in normal as well as hyperpigmented skin may have predisposed to formation of minocycline-associated pigment in these patients."

During the course of his disease, he developed changes in the porokeratosis lesions that included cellular atypia, dysplasia, and invasive squamous cell carcinoma. One of the squamous cell carcinomas produced regional and disseminated metastases, resulting in the death of the patient. Although malignancy has been previously described in the various types of porokeratosis, this is the first report of disseminated metastases and death in any form of this disease."
2446336	"Vitamin B6 (VB6) comprises six interconvertible pyridine compounds (vitamers), among which pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) is a coenzyme involved in a high diversity of biochemical reactions. In plants, PLP is de novo synthesized, and pyridoxine (PN) is usually maintained as the predominant B6 vitamer. Although the conversion from pyridoxal (PL) to PN catalyzed by PL reductase in plants has been confirmed, the enzyme itself remains largely unknown. We previously found pre-incubation at 35 °C dramatically enhanced PL reductase activity in tobacco leaf homogenate. In this study, we demonstrated that the increase in the reductase activity was a consequence of phyllosphere microbial proliferation. VB6 was detected from tobacco phyllosphere, and PL level was the highest among three non-phosphorylated B6 vitamers. When the sterile tobacco rich in PL were kept in an open, warm and humid environment to promote microorganism proliferation, a significant change from PL to PN was observed. Our results suggest that there may be a plant-microbe interaction in the conversion from PL to PN within tobacco phyllosphere."
1078066	"Previous reports have shown that alterations in cutaneous and plasmatic fibrinolytic activity are found in cutaneous necrotizing vasculitis (CNV). In a combined investigation with direct immunofluorescence and autohistographic evaluation of tissue fibrinolytic activity in the lesional skin of 20 subjects affected by Schonlein-Henoch (SH) syndrome, there was a marked decrease in cutaneous fibrinolytic activity in SH syndrome accompanied by deposits of fibrin-like material at the dermo-epidermal junction and around the small blood vessels of dermis in affected skin. These data suggest some interactions between decreased fibrinolytic activity, fibrin deposits, and the tissue damage in the development of skin changes in SH syndrome."
7454998	"This is a case report of malignant melanoma presenting with both clinical and histopathologic features of a seborrheic keratosis. Not a rare phenomenon, this report emphasizes the importance of biopsy to evaluate apparent seborrheic keratoses. We believe that this phenomenon is best considered a presentation of melanoma. Diminished routine histopathologic evaluation of apparent seborrheic keratoses may well increase the number of mistaken diagnoses in such cases."
6423230	"As clinicians who treat hepatocellular carcinoma move yttrium-90 intra-arterial radiotherapy from the palliative setting to the treatment of patients with potentially curable early stage disease, more intense scrutiny of the safety of that procedure is warranted. To demonstrate the potential risks associated with this treatment, in the following case report, we describe a patient with early stage hepatocellular carcinoma who experienced severe toxicity from intra-arterial radiotherapy.                                                                                            Screening studies in a 64-year-old Asian woman with a history of hepatitis C virus infection and cirrhosis identified a 3.5-cm well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma with no vascular invasion. After initial evaluation, the patient received treatment with intra-arterial radiotherapy. Four weeks after the conclusion of that therapy, she experienced nausea, vomiting, and weight loss. Upper endoscopy with biopsy identified antral gastritis and embolic microspheres in the submucosal layer of the gastric antrum.                                                                              When she was subsequently referred for a liver transplant evaluation, her symptoms included failure to thrive and persistent weight loss. She was initially treated with feeding via a jejunostomy tube and ultimately received a liver transplant. However, 8 months after transplant she required an urgent gastrojejunostomy to bypass a progressive pyloric outlet obstruction. At the time of this writing, 1 year has elapsed since this patient received a liver transplant. No evidence of malignancy has been identified, but she remains partially dependent on tube feedings.                                                                                      This case highlights the potential risks associated with radioactive microsphere embolization in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Given the paucity of data regarding the efficacy of this therapy in treating early stage disease, the use of radioactive microsphere therapy in that patient population should be prospectively studied. To minimize the risk of complications, internationally approved consensus guidelines for the delivery of yttrium-90 should be followed."
2841817	"Some plant-associated Bacillus strains produce induced systemic resistance (ISR) in the host, which contributes to their protective effect against phytopathogens. Little is known about the variety of elicitors responsible for ISR that are produced by Bacillus strains. Working with a particular strain, we have previously identified the surfactin lipopeptide as a main compound stimulating plant immune-related responses. However, with the perspective of developing Bacillus strains as biocontrol agents, it is important to establish whether a central role of surfactin is generally true for isolates belonging to the B. subtilis/amyloliquefaciens complex. To that end, we set up a comparative study involving a range of natural strains. Their secretomes were first tested for triggering early defense events in cultured tobacco cells. Six isolates with contrasting activities were further evaluated for ISR in plants, based both on macroscopic disease reduction and on stimulation of the oxylipin pathway as defense mechanism. A strong correlation was found between defense-inducing activity and the amount of surfactin produced by the isolates. These results support the idea of a widespread role for surfactin as a nonvolatile elicitor formed by B. subtilis/amyloliquefaciens, and screening for strong surfactin producers among strains naturally secreting multiple antibiotics could be an efficient approach to select good candidates as biopesticides."
5918610	"Salt tolerance is a complex trait involving the coordinated action of many gene families that perform a variety of functions such as control of water loss through stomata, ion sequestration, metabolic adjustment, osmotic adjustment and antioxidative defense. In spite of the large number of publications on the role of antioxidative defense under salt stress, the relative importance of this process to overall plant salt tolerance is still a matter of controversy. In this article, the generation and scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under normal and salt stress conditions in relation to the type of photosynthesis is discussed. The CO(2) concentrating mechanism in C4 and CAM plants is expected to contribute to decreasing ROS generation. However, the available data supports this hypothesis in CAM but not in C4 plants. We discuss the specific roles of enzymatic and non enzymatic antioxidants in relation to the oxidative load in the context of whole plant salt tolerance. The possible preventive antioxidative mechanisms are also discussed."

The median age of these patients was 49 years, and their median weight was 65.7 kg. The median nucleated cell dose infused was 2.07 x 10(7)/kg. Eight of the 13 patients demonstrated donor chimerism between 4 weeks and 6 months, and subsequent conversion to full donor chimerism was achieved in 5 patients. Three patients were alive and free of disease at 158 to 1054 days, with a median survival of 288 days after transplantation. The 100-day event-free survival is 69%, and overall survival is 77%. At 1 year, the event-free and overall survival was 43%. Treatment-related mortality observed within the first 100 days after transplantation was low: 1 previously extensively pretreated patient died of multiorgan failure. This result provides a basis for further exploring this potentially curative approach to selected patients who lack matched related or unrelated hematopoietic stem cell donors."
4367615	"Interactions between barley and the powdery mildew pathogen, Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei, (Bgh) are determined by unique combinations of host resistance genes, designated Mildew-resistance locus (Ml), and cognate pathogen avirulence genes. These interactions occur both dependent and independent of Rar1 (required for Mla12 resistance) and Sgt1 (Suppressor of G-two allele of skp1), which are differentially required for diverse plant disease-resistance pathways. We have isolated two new functional Mla alleles, Rar1-independent Mla7 and Rar1-dependent Mla10, as well as the Mla paralogs, Mla6-2 and Mla13-2. Utilizing the inherent diversity amongst Mla-encoded proteins, we identified the only two amino acids exclusively conserved in RAR1-dependent MLA6, MLA10, MLA12, and MLA13 that differ at the corresponding position in RAR1-independent MLA1 and MLA7. Two- and three-dimensional modeling places these residues on a predicted surface of the sixth leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain at positions distinct from those within the beta-sheets hypothesized to determine resistance specificity. Site-directed mutagenesis of these residues indicates that RAR1 independence requires the presence of an aspartate at position 721, as mutation of this residue to a structurally similar, but uncharged, asparagine did not alter RAR1 dependence. These results demonstrate that a single-amino acid substitution in the sixth MLA LRR can alter host signaling but not resistance specificity to B. graminis."
9724599	"Phalaenopsis is a winter-blooming orchid genus commonly cultivated in tropical Asian countries. Because orchids are one of the most economically important flower crops in Taiwan, it is crucial to understand their response to cold and other abiotic stresses. The present study focused on gene regulation of P. aphrodite in response to abiotic stress, mainly cold. Our results demonstrate that P. aphrodite is sensitive to low temperatures, especially in its reproductive stage. We found that after exposure to 4°C, plants in the vegetative stage maintained better membrane integrity and photosynthetic capacity than in the flowering stage. At the molecular level, C-repeat binding factor1 (PaCBF1) and its putative target gene dehydrin1 (PaDHN1) mRNAs were induced by cold, whereas inducer of CBF expression1 (PaICE1) mRNA was constitutively expressed. PaICE1 transactivated MYC motifs in the PaCBF1 promoter, indicating that up-regulation of PaCBF1 may be mediated by the binding of PaICE1 to MYC motifs. Overexpression of PaCBF1 in transgenic Arabidopsis induced AtCOR6.6 and RD29a without cold stimulus and maintained better membrane integrity after cold stress. Herein, we present evidence that cold induction of PaCBF1 transcripts in P. aphrodite may be transactivated by PaICE1 and consequently protect plants from cold damage through up-regulation of cold-regulated (COR) genes, such as DHN. To our knowledge, this study is the first report of the isolation and characterization of CBF, DHN and ICE genes in the Orchidaceae family."
1522672	"Acute tubular injury (ATI) is very common in biopsy specimens from renal allografts that suffer from delayed graft function (DGF) or dysfunction. Currently there are few reports on investigating small molecule metabolites in urine samples from transplant recipients as a noninvasive method to predict the ATI of renal allografts instead of an allograft biopsy. In our study matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization Fourier transform mass spectrometry (MALDI-FTMS) was used to analyze small molecule metabolites in urine samples from renal transplant recipients with biopsy-proven slight ATI or moderate ATI or acute tubular necrosis (ATN). To evaluate the ATI-specific value of those small molecules, we applied the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) program. Mass spectra data were imported into the PCA, where loading graphs were constructed to express the constituents of the urine samples. Slight ATI, moderate ATI, or ATN of renal allografts were separated obviously in the loading graph. The position of urine samples in the graph may reflect the tubular injury status of allografts. A farther apart point from the original site may mean the allograft suffered from more severe ATI (even ATN), and vice versa. Detection of small molecule metabolites in urine samples of recipients through MALDI-FTMS may offer a promising noninvasive, high throughput, rapid tool to predict ATI/ATN of renal allografts."
9954060	"Cardiovascular heart disease due to atherosclerosis is the commonest cause of mortality and morbidity in the Western world. Atherosclerosis is directly related to disorders of lipid metabolism, diabetes mellitus (DM), and insulin resistance. Disorders of thyroid function and porphyrin metabolism occur less frequently but may cause life-threatening situations if unrecognized. All these disorders are associated with characteristic dermatoses, which should permit early diagnosis and meaningful intervention."
2948415	"Graft pancreatitis is induced by ischemia/reperfusion injury in which neutrophil infiltration is believed to be a crucial early event. This observation suggests the presence of adhesion molecules already at the time of reperfusion. Therefore, this study was performed to evaluate the pattern of ICAM-1 and P-Selectin expression on human pancreas allografts following cold ischemia and reperfusion.                                                                                           We performed an analysis of pancreas biopsy specimens taken from 13 patients undergoing pancreas transplantation compared with pancreas specimens from 10 patients following resection. Cryostat sections were stained with monoclonal antibodies against CD11b, a neutrophil marker, and the adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and P-Selectin.                                                                              Extensive infiltration of CD11b-positive cells was detected in venules and capillaries of pancreas allografts after reperfusion (18.38 +/- 0.87) compared with controls (T1 4.22 +/- 0.55) or with tissue specimens at about 10 hours of cold ischemia (2.60 +/- 0.35; P <    .001). Similarly, the pattern of P-Selectin showed a moderate expression before organ harvest (1.54 +/- 0.21) and in samples during cold ischemia (1.46 +/- 0.24) followed by a significantly greater number of P-Selectin-positive cells after reperfusion (2.54 +/- 0.18; P = .005). ICAM-1 was only weakly expressed on the surface of the venular endothelium in all controls (0.77 +/- 0.12). In contrast to P-Selectin, ICAM-1 showed prominent up-regulation during cold ischemia (2.23 +/- 0.23; P <    .001) with no further increase after reperfusion (2.23 +/- 0.17).                                                                                     The data suggested that ICAM-1 was already up-regulated during cold ischemia, possibly representing the mechanism of early neutrophil infiltration observed in human pancreatic ischemia/reperfusion injury."
5895012	"Some AGP molecules or their sugar moieties are probably related to the guidance of the pollen tube into the embryo sac, in the final part of its pathway, when arriving at the ovules. The specific labelling of the synergid cells and its filiform apparatus, which are the cells responsible for pollen tube attraction, and also the specific labelling of the micropyle and micropylar nucellus, which constitutes the pollen tube entryway into the embryo sac, are quite indicative of this role. We also discuss the possibility that AGPs in the sperm cells are probably involved in the double fertilization process."
2308626	"Loss-of-function mutations in the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) ENHANCED DISEASE RESISTANCE1 (EDR1) gene confer enhanced resistance to powdery mildew infection, enhanced senescence, and enhanced programmed cell death under both abiotic and biotic stress conditions. All edr1-mediated phenotypes can be suppressed by a specific missense mutation (keg-4) in the KEEP ON GOING (KEG) gene, which encodes a multidomain protein that includes a RING E3 ligase domain, a kinase domain, ankyrin repeats, and HERC2-like (for HECT and RCC1-like) repeats. The molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying this suppression are poorly understood. Using confocal laser scanning microscopy and fluorescent protein fusions, we determined that KEG localizes to trans-Golgi network/early endosome (TGN/EE) vesicles. Both the keg-4 mutation, which is located in the carboxyl-terminal HERC2-like repeats, and deletion of the entire HERC2-like repeats reduced endosomal localization of KEG and increased localization to the endoplasmic reticulum and cytosol, indicating that the HERC2-like repeats facilitate the TGN/EE targeting of KEG. EDR1 colocalized with KEG to the TGN/EE when coexpressed but localized primarily to the endoplasmic reticulum when expressed alone. Yeast two-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation analyses revealed that EDR1 and KEG physically interact. Deletion of the HERC2-like repeats abolished the interaction between KEG and EDR1 as well as the KEG-induced TGN/EE localization of EDR1, indicating that the recruitment of EDR1 to the TGN/EE is based on a direct interaction between EDR1 and KEG mediated by the HERC2-like repeats. Collectively, these data suggest that EDR1 and KEG function together to regulate endocytic trafficking and/or the formation of signaling complexes on TGN/EE vesicles during stress responses."
9333889	"With the recent trend for nondermatologists to treat dermatologic disorders, this retrospective biopsy study reviews the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of physicians of different specialties performing surgical dermatologic procedures.                                                                                  We assessed the diagnostic abilities of nondermatologist physicians who performed various types of skin biopsies and compared them with those of dermatologists.                                                                              The clinical diagnoses of family physicians, plastic, general, and orthopedic surgeons, and internists and pediatricians versus dermatologists were correlated with the histopathologic diagnoses. In total, 4451 cases were analyzed.                                                                              Dermatologists diagnosed twice the number of neoplastic and cystic skin lesions correctly (75%) than nondermatologists (40%). The clinical diagnosis rendered by family practitioners matched the histopathologic diagnosis in only 26% of neoplastic and cystic skin lesions. Plastic surgeons, who performed the largest number of cutaneous surgical procedures among the nondermatologists, did better in the recognition of skin tumors than family physicians, but still had a diagnostic accuracy rate of only 45%. Inflammatory skin diseases were correctly diagnosed in 71% of the cases by dermatologists but in only 34% of the cases by nondermatologists.                                                                                      A limitation of this retrospective, unblinded study is the use of the clinical data from the pathology requisition form as a surrogate for clinical diagnostic accuracy.                                                                                      The overall accuracy of the clinical diagnosis depends heavily on the clinicopathologic correlation. Without sufficient clinical data, the histopathologic diagnosis will be limited or restricted. This review concludes that without basic dermatology knowledge, clinicopathologic correlation is compromised."

1052979	"We have developed a bioengineered implant (BI) to evaluate strategies to promote graft survival and function in models of islet transplantation in mice. The BI, sized for implantation within a fold of intestinal mesentery, consists of a disk-shaped, polyvinyl alcohol sponge infused  with a type I collagen hydrogel that contains dispersed donor islets. To promote islet vascularization, the BI incorporates a spherical alginate hydrogel for sustained release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). BIs that contained 450-500 islets from syngeneic (C57Bl/6) donors  and 20 ng of VEGF reversed streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes in 100% of mice (8/8), whereas BIs that contained an equivalent number of islets, but which lacked VEGF, reversed STZ-induced diabetes in only 62.5% of mice (5/8). Between these ""+VEGF"" and ""-VEGF""  groups, the time to achieve normoglycemia (8-18 days after implantation) did not differ statistically; however, transitory, postoperative hypoglycemia was markedly reduced in the +VEGF group relative to the -VEGF group. Notably, none of the mice that achieved normoglycemia in  these two groups required exogenous insulin therapy once the BIs began to fully regulate levels of blood glucose. Moreover, the transplanted mice responded to glucose challenge in a near-normal manner, as compared to the responses of healthy, nondiabetic (control) mice that had not received  STZ. In future studies, the BIs described here will serve as platforms to evaluate the capability of immunomodulatory compounds, delivered locally within the BI, to prevent or reverse diabetes in the setting of autoimmune (type 1) diabetes."
8671253	"The aim of the study was to evaluate and analyze the results of liver transplants from living and deceased donors in Saudi Arabia.                                                                                            We performed a retrospective study from the National Registry reported to the Saudi Center for Organ Transplantation on 616 living donors and deceased donors between 2004 and 2010. Data included donors ' characteristics and acceptance rates of livers from deceased donors, recipient's status posttransplant, follow-ups, and patient survival.                                                                              A total of 612 cases from deceased donors consented for liver donation of whom 402 cases (65.7%) were retrieved; 332 of them (82.3%) were transplanted. The mean age of the deceased donors was 33.2 years. Regarding living-donor liver transplants, 285 transplants were performed mostly from parent to offspring or offspring to parent. The mean age of the donors was 26.6 years and male/female ratio was 3/1. The mean follow-up was 745 days, and the mean posttransplant stay in hospital was 28.2 days. There were 11 cases with primary nonfunctioning grafts. At the end of the follow-up, 532 patients were alive (88%) and 58 patients died (10%). The patient survival at 3 years and the estimated 5-year survival were 87.2% and 77.1%.                                                                                      The outcome of liver transplanting in Saudi Arabia is comparable to international levels. However, the need to increase the acceptance rate and the use of procured livers requires more effort in managing deceased donors. Both living-donor and deceased-donor liver transplants should be continued in Saudi Arabia to meet the ever-increasing demand of patients with end-stage liver disease."
3401744	"We demonstrate that XopD, a type III effector from Xanthomonas campestris pathovar vesicatoria (Xcv), suppresses symptom production during the late stages of infection in susceptible tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) leaves. XopD-dependent delay of tissue degeneration correlates with reduced chlorophyll loss, reduced salicylic acid levels, and changes in the mRNA abundance of senescence- and defense-associated genes despite high pathogen titers. Subsequent structure-function analyses led to the discovery that XopD is a DNA binding protein that alters host transcription. XopD contains a putative helix-loop-helix domain required for DNA binding and two conserved ERF-associated amphiphilic motifs required to repress salicylic acid- and jasmonic acid-induced gene transcription in planta. Taken together, these data reveal that XopD is a unique virulence factor in Xcv that alters host transcription, promotes pathogen multiplication, and delays the onset of leaf chlorosis and necrosis."
1663377	"Characterization of mechanisms that can reverse residual damage from prior skin exposure to ultraviolet (UV) would be of considerable biological and therapeutic interest. Topical caffeine application to mouse skin that had previously been treated with UV has been shown to inhibit the subsequent development of squamous cell carcinomas.                                                                                   We used an established mouse photodamage model to investigate other possible effects of topical caffeine application after UV.                                                                              SKH-1 hairless mice were treated with ultraviolet B (UVB) followed immediately by topical application of caffeine or vehicle three times weekly for 11 weeks.                                                                              Caffeine applied topically after UV treatment resulted in a significant decrease in UV-induced skin roughness/transverse rhytides as assessed by treatment-blinded examiners. Histologically, topical caffeine application after a single dose of UVB more than doubled the number of apoptotic keratinocytes as evaluated by sunburn cell formation, caspase 3 cleavage and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labelling (TUNEL) staining. A trend towards decreased solar elastosis was noted in the caffeine-treated group although this was not statistically significant. Other histological parameters including epidermal hyperplasia, solar elastosis and angiogenesis were increased in mice treated with UV but topical application of caffeine did not alter these particular UV effects.                                                                                      These findings support the concept that topical application of caffeine to mouse skin after UV irradiation promotes the deletion of DNA-damaged keratinocytes and may partially diminish photodamage as well as photocarcinogenesis."
2986871	"The field of transplantation is faced with a growing shortage of human organs as the list of potential recipients continues to increase. Those currently listed can already expect long waits; some die waiting. Xenotransplantation is a potential solution to this widening donor-recipient disparity. Consequently, in recent years, there have been several clinical attempts using organs from nonhuman primates and pigs. The results with nonhuman primates as donors have been encouraging, but it is unlikely that these species will provide a long-term solution to the organ shortage. Most recent xenotransplantation research has therefore shifted to more phylogenetically disparate species, such as pigs, as potential donors. The major barrier to transplantation between members of disparate species combinations has been hyperacute rejection (HAR). The elements of humoral immunity involved in this rejection process include (1) naturally occurring antibodies directed against carbohydrate and other antigens expressed on pig endothelium, and (2) the complement system, which is activated by binding of natural antibodies to their targets. Several elegant strategies to prevent HAR are being developed. The creation of transgenic pigs, whose cells express human regulators of complement activation, is one such strategy. Another promising approach has been to remove antidonor antibodies from the recipient by absorption with some recently characterized carbohydrate epitopes of porcine endothelial xenoantigens. Recent experimental work indicates that HAR can successfully be prevented by inhibition or depletion of complement. A delayed type of xenograft rejection, characterized by endothelial cell antibody deposition and cellular infiltration, occurs over the next three to four days. The likely mechanisms involved in delayed xenograft rejection include antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and the phenomenon of endothelial cell activation."
6872542	"The shortage of kidneys from brain-dead donors for transplantation has made it necessary to look for alternatives. Living kidney donation is one possibility. However, because of ABO blood group incompatibility or immunological reasons, transplantation of kidneys from a living donor is not always possible. The seven Dutch kidney transplantation centers have developed a joint protocol for crossover, or paired donor exchange, kidney transplantation. To ensure a fair chance for all participating donor-recipient pairs, the Dutch Transplantation Foundation has developed an allocation algorithm to match compatible donor-recipient pairs. A crossover match is performed every 3 months. The computer program developed by the Dutch Transplantation Foundation to match compatible donor-recipient pairs calculates the match probability (MP) of every potential recipient. The MP takes into account the peak panel-reactive antibodies (%PRA) of the recipient, the incidence within the crossover donor population of (compatible) ABO blood group, and HLA unacceptables of the recipient. The potential recipient with the lowest MP, in other words, the recipient with the smallest chance of finding a compatible donor in the pool, is ranked first. Until now, three matches have been performed in the Netherlands. A total of 53 pairs from all seven Dutch transplantation centers have participated. For 22 of the pairs a compatible donor-recipient pair was found."
1108399	"There are no data regarding the outcome of solitary pancreas transplantation (SPT) with portal venous drainage (PVD) following unsuccessful islet transplantation (ITx) after multiple islet injections into the portal vein. We herein describe the outcome of three SPTs with PVD performed after failed ITx.                                                                              Between October 2002 and December 2003, three SPTs with PVD were performed following unsuccessful ITx with multiple intraportal islet injections (mean 2.3 injections: range 2 to 3 injections) in two women and one man, aged 26, 49, and 60 years. Panel reactive antibody titer was 0% in all recipients. Immunosuppression was based on induction with either basiliximab (n = 2) or thymoglobulin (n = 1); maintenance therapy included steroids, mycophenolate mofetil, and tacrolimus. During the recipient operation, the absence of venous hypertension was established by direct measurement of portal pressure, before making the final decision to drain the pancreas into the portal vein.                                                                              Portal pressures were 16 cm H2O, 14 cm H2O, and 13 cm H2O. Pancreas grafts were reperfused after a period of cold preservation of 638, 695, and 835 minutes, respectively. All grafts showed immediate endocrine function, maintaining their recipients insulin-independent for longest follow-ups of 8, 21, and 23 months, respectively. One recipient developed a nonocclusive venous thrombus that resolved with intravenous heparin infusion.                                                                                      Our experience showed that unsuccessful ITx with multiple intraportal injections does not necessarily preclude the possibility of subsequent successful SPT with PVD. Further experience is needed to define contraindications and possible complications of SPT with PVD following ITx."

9478235	"A 63-year-old immunocompetent patient presented with a 4 month history of 12 painless nodules in a linear array on his right arm. He had a history of a surgery for a cutaneous tumor on the dorsum of his right middle finger about a year prior, but he did not follow up after the surgery. A differential diagnosis of sporotrichosis, atypical mycobacteria, deep fungal infection, and metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) was considered. Skin biopsy revealed islands of dysplastic squamous cells and keratin pearls in a desmoplastic stroma in the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue. The behavior of the disease was very aggressive, with rapid dissemination in a linear array, mimicking an infectious sporotrichoid spread. To our knowledge, this is the second case report of sporotrichoid metastases to the skin from cutaneous SCC in an immunocompetent patient."
4317160	"Chronic renal failure is a common complication of heart transplantation. Sirolimus (SRL) is an immunosuppressive drug that, unlike calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs), is not associated with nephrotoxicity.                                                                              We collected efficacy and safety data from a Spanish registry of heart transplant recipients who were switched from a CNI to SRL due to renal failure. Patients were included if the serum creatinine level before switching was >   1.5 mg/dL and/or the estimated creatinine clearance level was below 50 mL/min.                                                                              Ninety-seven patients started SRL due to renal impairment. When SRL was started, CNIs were progressively tapered and in some cases withdrawn. Mean baseline creatinine level was 2.5 mg/dL and mean creatinine clearance level was 39 mL/min. Only 1 episode of acute rejection was observed in a patient receiving SRL plus cyclosporine (CsA) but the eventual allograft function remained stable. Compared with baseline, a significant improvement in renal function was observed at 6 months among patients who stopped CNIs before the third month after SRL was started, although not among those who continued taking CNIs. Upon multivariate analysis, no predictors of response were observed. SRL was withdrawn in 18% of patients due to adverse events.                                                                                      Switching to SRL was safe in heart allograft recipients, improving renal function among those previously receiving a CNI. Renal function improves if CNIs are withdrawn soon after starting SRL."

3597372	"Chloroplasts are the site of photosynthesis and the biosynthesis of essential metabolites, including amino acids, fatty acids, and secondary metabolites. It is known that many seedling-lethal mutants are impaired in chloroplast function or development, indicating the development of functional chloroplast is essential for plant growth and development. Here, we isolated a novel transfer DNA insertion mutant, dubbed sel1 (for seedling lethal1), that exhibited a pigment-defective and seedling-lethal phenotype with a disrupted pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) gene. Sequence analysis revealed that SEL1 is a member of the PLS subgroup, which is lacking known E/E(+) or DYW domains at the C terminus, in the PLS subfamily of the PPR protein family containing a putative N-terminal transit peptide and 14 putative PPR or PPR-like motifs. Confocal microscopic analysis showed that the SEL1-green fluorescent protein fusion protein is localized in chloroplasts. Transmission electron microscopic analysis revealed that the sel1 mutant is impaired in the etioplast, as well as in chloroplast development. In sel1 mutants, plastid-encoded proteins involved in photosynthesis were rarely detected due to the lack of the corresponding transcripts. Furthermore, transcript profiles of plastid genes revealed that, in sel1 mutants, the transcript levels of plastid-encoded RNA polymerase-dependent genes were greatly reduced, but those of nuclear-encoded RNA polymerase-dependent genes were increased or not changed. Additionally, the RNA editing of two editing sites of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase beta subunit gene transcripts in the sel1 mutant was compromised, though it is not directly connected with the sel1 mutant phenotype. Our results demonstrate that SEL1 is involved in the regulation of plastid gene expression required for normal chloroplast development."
8179707	"Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a frequent pathogen of humans and many animal species, and has become established as a veterinary pathogen.                                                                                  In this case report we describe an MRSA infection in a dwarf rabbit, treatment of the infection and, subsequently, the genetic analysis of the isolated strain. The pet rabbit was presented to an animal hospital due to recurrent swellings on the head and on the neck. Bacteriological examination yielded Staphylococcus aureus, which was resistant to β-lactam antibiotics. The isolate was confirmed as an MRSA by mecA PCR, Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) negative, and typed as multilocus sequence type (ST)398/staphylococcal protein A (spa) type t011/staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) type SCCmecIVa. The rabbit was treated with rifampicin for 2 weeks. After 2.5 weeks the rabbit was clinically normal and control swabs were negative for MRSA.                                                                                                              This study is the first to report MRSA in a rabbit in Austria. This study contributes to the growing evidence that MRSA ST398 could be isolated from a variety of animals."
2328422	"Clonotype analysis is essential for complete characterization of antigen-specific T cells. Moreover, knowledge on clonal identity allows tracking of antigen-specific T cells in whole blood and tissue infiltrates and can provide information on antigenic specificity. Here, we developed a next generation sequencing (NGS)-based platform for the highly quantitative clonotype characterization of T cells and determined requirements for the unbiased characterization of the input material (DNA, RNA, ex vivo derived or cell culture expanded T cells). Thereafter we performed T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire analysis of various specimens in clinical settings including cytomegalovirus (CMV), polyomavirus BK (BKV) reactivation and acute cellular allograft rejection. Our results revealed dynamic nature of virus-specific T cell clonotypes; CMV reactivation was linked to appearance of new highly abundant antigen-specific clonalities. Moreover, analysis of clonotype overlap between BKV-, alloantigen-specific T cell-, kidney allograft- and urine-derived lymphocytes provided hints for the differential diagnosis of allograft dysfunction and enabled appropriate therapy adjustment. We believe that the established approach will provide insights into the regulation of virus-specific/anti-tumor immunity and has high diagnostic potential in the clinical routine."
6518087	"Most previously published studies of patients with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type I are small or have short follow-up period. We report the outcome of a fairly large cohort of patients followed up for nearly 10 years.                                                                              Retrospective cohort study. Graft survival, recurrence rate and risk factors for recurrence were analyzed for 43 patients transplanted between the years 1995 and 2012.                                                                              At a mean overall follow-up of 118 ± 61 months (median, 127.8; range, 4.9-217), 12 patients lost their graft (28%). Death-censored actuarial 15-year graft survival rate was 56%. Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis recurred in eight patients (19%) at a median time of 15.4 months (range, 4.4-70 months). Recurrence led to graft loss in seven patients (88%) within a median of 11.6 months (range, 1.3-54 months) from diagnosis. Median graft survival was 30.5 months for recurrence (range, 7-86). Actuarial 15-year graft survival was 71% for nonrecurrent. The risk for recurrence was higher for patients with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) B49 (odds ratio, 16.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-246; P=0.038) and HLA DR4 (odds ratio, 15.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-237; P=0.044) alleles. A trend toward increased risk was found with shorter duration of dialysis before transplantation. Four of 16 (25%) living-related versus none of the living-unrelated donors' recipients recurred. The HLA B49, acute tubular necrosis after transplantation, previous transplantations, and Arab origin were all associated with decreased graft and patient survival.                                                                                     Patients without recurrence in the first years should expect an excellent graft survival. Nonrelated living donors should be preferred. The HLA B49 and DR4 alleles may increase the risk for recurrence."
4903646	"Recently, considerable focus has been placed on the use of hypothermic perfusion ex vivo in abdominal organ transplant. Herein, we discuss the appropriateness of using this modality to preserve livers, in particular those of suboptimal quality, and whether perfusing at warmer temperatures in this context may, in fact, be better.                                                                                      Hypothermic perfusion (0-4°C) appears to improve the hepatocellular energy charge and achieve adequate results in normal livers. However, its use for the preservation of suboptimal grafts may lead to significant endothelial and Kupffer cell injury that is incompatible with survival. Studies on the perfusion of suboptimal livers at higher temperatures, on the contrary, indicate that results improve as temperatures approach 37°C, provided that the oxygen supply during perfusion is adequate.                                                                                  Normothermic perfusion provides oxygen and other metabolic substrates under physiological conditions; in liver transplant, it appears to be the best option to improve the viability of suboptimal organs."
7504107	"Infectious complications such as bacteremia after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. We retrospectively analyzed the frequency and characteristics of posttransplant bacteremia in 181 adult LDLT recipients between April 2006 and November 2009, and we evaluated the risk factors for posttransplant bacteremia. One hundred seventeen episodes of bacteremia occurred in 62 of 181 recipients (34.3%) within 12 days (median) after transplantation (range = 1-71 days). The most frequently isolated pathogens were Pseudomonasaeruginosa (26 episodes), methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (22 episodes), and Enterococcus sp. (11 episodes). The overall survival rate at 1 year for patients with bacteremia (n = 62) was significantly lower than the rate for patients without bacteremia (n = 119; 69.6% versus 92.3%, respectively, P <    0.0001). Multivariate analysis showed that Child-Pugh class C (P = 0.0002), preoperative massive pleural effusion or ascites requiring drainage (P = 0.0384), postoperative cytomegalovirus infection (P = 0.0014), ABO incompatibility (P = 0.0188), and older donor age (P = 0.015) were independent risk factors for postoperative bacteremia. In conclusion, bacteremia occurred at a high rate after adult LDLT and induced a higher mortality rate in those who developed it. Infection control may play a pivotal role in improving early outcomes after LDLT."
3338564	"Following adoptive transfer into irradiated recipients, thymocytes can be induced to respond strongly to vaccinia virus. High levels of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) activity may be generated from thymus, but not from spleen, of 3-day-old mice. The capacity of thymocytes to differentiate into effector CTL tends to be lost with age. Some of this loss may reflect positive suppression: a single, low dose of cyclophosphamide allows the reemergence of responsiveness in at least one mouse strain. Thymocytes from [A leads to (A x B)F1] and [(A x B)F1 leads to A] chimeras show the response patterns that would by predicted from previous studies of lymph node and spleen cells. However, thymic function seems to be rapidly lost in the [A leads to (A x B)F1] Chimeras."
7858250	"A 21-year-old male patient with the clinical tetrad of arthritis, urethritis, conjunctivitis, and mucocutaneous lesions, commonly known as Reiter syndrome was presented. He was hospitalized in poor condition, with fever, bilateral conjunctivitis, swollen and painful knee and tarsal joints, low back pain, Achilles tendonitis, dactilitis, keratoderma blenorrhagica, purulent urethritis, circinate balanitis, and oral erosive lesions. Radiography and Computerized Axial Tomography (CAT) showed sacroileitis, spondilosis thoracalis, and arthritis of the feet. The laboratory studies revealed anemia, neutrophilic leukocytosis, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), hypoalbuminemia, negative rheumatoid factor, pyuria, proteinuria, and the presence of HLA-B27. The microbiological examinations of samples from pustular lesions, throat, eyes, urethra, stool, and blood were sterile. Urethral smear was positive for Chlamydia trachomatis (PCR). The histopathological picture of skin lesions was consistent with pustular psoriasis. Systemic treatment with antibiotics, corticosteroids, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs produced clinical improvement. This clinical syndrome requires comprehensive evaluation and multidisciplinary management."

4276022	"Exposure of Arabidopsis leaves to nitrogen dioxide (NO     2      ) results in nitration of specific chloroplast proteins. To determine whether NO     2       itself and/or nitrite derived from NO     2       can nitrate proteins, Arabidopsis thylakoid membranes were isolated and treated with NO     2      -bubbled or potassium nitrite (KNO     2      ) buffer, followed by protein extraction, electrophoresis, and immunoblotting using an anti-3-nitrotyrosine (NT) antibody. NO     2       concentrations in the NO     2      -bubbled buffer were calculated by numerically solving NO     2       dissociation kinetic equations. The two buffers were adjusted to have identical nitrite concentrations. Both treatments yielded an NT-immunopositive band that LC/MS identified as PSBO1. The difference in the band intensity between the 2 treatments was designated nitration by NO     2      . Both NO     2       and nitrite mediated nitration of proteins, and the nitration ability per unit NO     2       concentration was ∼100-fold greater than that of nitrite."

6246921	"Rice productivity is largely affected by low temperature, which can be harmful throughout plant development, from germination to grain filling. Germination of indica rice cultivars under cold is slow and not uniform, resulting in irregular emergence and small plant population. To identify and characterize novel genes involved in cold tolerance during the germination stage, two indica rice genotypes (sister lines previously identified as cold-tolerant and cold-sensitive) were used in parallel transcriptomic analysis (RNAseq) under cold treatment (seeds germinating at 13 °C for 7 days). We detected 1,361 differentially expressed transcripts. Differences in gene expression found by RNAseq were confirmed for 11 selected genes using RT-qPCR. Biological processes enhanced in the cold-tolerant seedlings include: cell division and expansion (confirmed by anatomical sections of germinating seeds), cell wall integrity and extensibility, water uptake and membrane transport capacity, sucrose synthesis, generation of simple sugars, unsaturation of membrane fatty acids, wax biosynthesis, antioxidant capacity (confirmed by histochemical staining of H2O2), and hormone and Ca(2+)-signaling. The cold-sensitive seedlings respond to low temperature stress increasing synthesis of HSPs and dehydrins, along with enhanced ubiquitin/proteasome protein degradation pathway and polyamine biosynthesis. Our findings can be useful in future biotechnological approaches aiming to cold tolerance in indica rice."

Twenty-seven active PV patients and 26 controls with other dermatologic disorders were included in the study. The severity of oral and cutaneous involvement was assessed and recorded. ELISA test for the measurement of anti-dsg1 and anti-dsg3 antibodies was performed (Medical and Biological Laboratories Co. Ltd., Nagoya, Japan). The cut-off ELISA value for both anti-dsg1 and anti-dsg3 was taken as 20.                                                                              Of the 27 patients, 26 were ELISA positive for anti-dsg1 antibodies and 23 for anti-dsg3 antibodies. Of the controls, two were positive for anti-dsg1 and none for anti-dsg3 antibodies. The sensitivity and specificity of ELISA for anti-dsg1 in the diagnosis of PV were 96.3% and 92.3%, respectively. For anti-dsg3, they were 85.2% and 100%, respectively. The different morphologic types of PV could not be differentiated on the basis of antibody profile; however, a direct correlation between anti-dsg3 titers and the severity of oral disease was noted, and also between anti-dsg1 titers and the severity of cutaneous disease.

Specific antibody titers correlate with disease severity; however, desmoglein testing cannot differentiate between the various morphologic subtypes of PV."
8580223	"We report monozygous triplets affected with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB). The female triplets were delivered by Caesarean section and skin fragility of each child, which was partly induced by trauma, was apparent from the third to fourth day of life. Clinically, the triplets were equally affected. Mutation analysis in this family revealed a novel recessively expressed glycine substitution, G2031S, in exon 73 of the collagen VII gene COL7A1. Most glycine substitutions in this gene region encoding for the triple helical domain of collagen VII are associated with milder, dominantly inherited phenotypes. By contrast, the novel point mutation of this study is clinically silent in the heterozygous state and leads to a severe DEB subtype when homozygous."
8004384	"Plants have a proven track record for the expression of biopharmaceutically interesting proteins. Importantly, plants and mammals share a highly conserved secretory pathway that allows similar folding, assembly and posttranslational modifications of proteins. Human butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is a highly sialylated, tetrameric serum protein, investigated as a bioscavenger for organophosphorous nerve agents. Expression of recombinant BChE (rBChE) in Nicotiana benthamiana results in accumulation of both monomers as well as assembled oligomers. In particular, we show here that co-expression of BChE with a novel gene-stacking vector, carrying six mammalian genes necessary for in planta protein sialylation, resulted in the generation of rBChE decorated with sialylated N-glycans. The N-glycosylation profile of monomeric rBChE secreted to the apoplast largely resembles the plasma-derived orthologue. In contrast, rBChE purified from total soluble protein extracts was decorated with a significant portion of ER-typical oligomannosidic structures. Biochemical analyses and live-cell imaging experiments indicated that impaired N-glycan processing is due to aberrant deposition of rBChE oligomers in the endoplasmic reticulum or endoplasmic-reticulum-derived compartments. In summary, we show the assembly of rBChE multimers, however, also points to the need for in-depth studies to explain the unexpected subcellular targeting of oligomeric BChE in plants."

Efficacy was measured at 90 and 180 days by the Fabi/Bolton Chest Wrinkle Scale, mid-clavicular to nipple distance, masked assessment, Physician and Subject Global Aesthetic Improvement Scales, and patient satisfaction. Adverse events were recorded.

Mean (SD) mid-clavicular to nipple distance decreased (P <    .0001), from 20.9 (1.57) cm to 19.8 (1.50) cm and 19.5 (1.59) cm, at days 90 and 180, respectively. At day 90, 100% were improved by Subject Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale score (P <    .0001) and 96% were improved by Physician Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale score (P <    .0001), with similar findings at day 180. All subjects were satisfied or very satisfied at day 90, with similar results at day 180. Improvement by masked assessment at day 90 was 71%.

We investigated the effects of nicotinamide, one of the B vitamins, on biosynthesis of sphingolipids, including ceramides and other stratum corneum lipids, in cultured normal human keratinocytes, and on the epidermal permeability barrier in vivo.                                                                              The rate of sphingolipid biosynthesis was measured by the incorporation of [14C]-serine into sphingolipids.                                                                              When the cells were incubated with 1-30 micromol L-1 nicotinamide for 6 days, the rate of ceramide biosynthesis was increased dose-dependently by 4.1-5. 5-fold on the sixth day compared with control. Nicotinamide also increased the synthesis of glucosylceramide (7.4-fold) and sphingomyelin (3.1-fold) in the same concentration range effective for ceramide synthesis. Furthermore, the activity of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), the rate-limiting enzyme in sphingolipid synthesis, was increased in nicotinamide-treated cells. Nicotinamide increased the levels of human LCB1 and LCB2 mRNA, both of which encode subunits of SPT. This suggested that the increase in SPT activity was due to an increase in SPT mRNA. Nicotinamide increased not only ceramide synthesis but also free fatty acid (2.3-fold) and cholesterol synthesis (1.5-fold). Topical application of nicotinamide increased ceramide and free fatty acid levels in the stratum corneum, and decreased transepidermal water loss in dry skin.

Patients with biopsy-proven systemic amyloidosis diagnosed in Italy between January 1995 and December 2000 were selected from 49 Nephrology and Internal Medicine Units provided they showed signs characteristic of renal involvement. Clinical and laboratory information were collected by using a specific data form for diagnosis integrated by a questionnaire on diagnostic tools. Collected data were matched both with the Italian Registry of Renal Biopsies (IRRB) and the Registry of the Italian Society of Amyloidosis (SIA) in order to approximate the incidence of the disease.                                                                              Of all patients, 373 were finally selected throughout Italy with an estimated mean incidence of renal amyloidosis of 2.1 per million population (p.m.p.) per year. Of those, 237 were affected from AL (primary) amyloidosis, 104 from AA (secondary) amyloidosis and 6 from AF (heredofamilial) forms. In 26 cases the type of amyloidosis remained undetermined. Among patients with AL, 36 presented an associated multiple myeloma (MM). Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was the commonest underlying disease in AA. Median age ranged between 63 and 65 years in all groups. Males were prevalent in AL and females in AA. The main clinical features of renal involvement were represented by nephrotic syndrome and renal failure observed in 59 and 54% of cases, respectively. The presence of a lambda light chain, either in serum or urine was significantly associated to a more elevated urinary protein loss and to a reduced renal function. Patients with AA showed a worse renal function at presentation than patients with AL, possibly due to a late diagnosis and/or referral to nephrology units. Diagnosis was obtained by renal biopsy in 315 cases, by abdominal fat tissue (AFT) aspiration/biopsy in 156 patients and by other organ biopsies in 47 patients. Characterization of deposits was extremely variable among referring centres.                                                                                      Our results point to an increased incidence of renal amyloidosis observed in Italy over the period 1996-2000 with AL as the prevalent type. Characterization of amyloid deposits still remains the major diagnostic challenge of the disease. The institution of networks dedicated to rare diseases is strongly recommended in order to effectively afford this challenge."
5293514	"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common inflammatory skin disease with recurring episodes of itching and a chronic relapsing course. Keishibukuryogan (KBG) is a traditional herbal medicine, composed of five kinds of medical plants and has been administered to patients with blood stagnation in Japan. This study investigated the effect of KBG on the disease activity in AD (n = 45) patients. AD patients were administered KBG for 4 to 6 weeks in addition to their prescribed medications. The results showed that the SCORAD index and VAS score were significantly decreased after the administration of KBG (P <    0.01). KBG also decreased the serum LDH level significantly (P <    0.01). The global assessment of the clinical response in SCORAD index showed that 88.5% of the patients with moderate improvement to excellent response (n = 26) had a high lichenification score (lichenification score ≥2 in SCORAD). On the other hand, only 42.1% of the patients with no improvement to mild improvement (n = 19) had a high lichenification score. Furthermore, long-term administration of KBG for 9-67 weeks showed a marked improvement in patients with a high lichenification score. Therefore, KBG was found to be effective against AD, particularly in cases presenting with lichenified lesions."
4708301	"Hyperacute rejection of organ xenografts is thought to be mediated by the reaction of naturally occurring antibodies and complement of the recipient with blood vessels in the donor organ. We have suggested previously that the pathogenesis of hyperacute rejection might involve the activation of endothelial cells in the graft. To evaluate the potential role of natural antibodies and complement in hyperacute xenograft rejection, sixteen human sera were tested for variation in the ability to activate porcine endothelial cells as manifested by the release of biosynthetically labeled heparan sulfate from the cells. It was then asked to which extent such variation might reflect differences in natural antibody titer and/or complement activity. The sera mediated release of 3.6-57% of endothelial cell-associated heparan sulfate. Heparan sulfate release correlated significantly with the titer, in the sera, of IgM antibodies that bound to cultured endothelial cells (P = 0.0008) or to a triad of glycoproteins believed to represent the major targets of natural antibodies in porcine to primate xenografts (P = 0.001); correlation was also observed with the total concentration of IgM (P = 0.0046). The release of heparan sulfate did not correlate with corresponding properties of serum IgG, with anti-swine hemagglutination or with isohemagglutination titers. Heparan sulfate release correlated with deposition on endothelial cells of iC3b (P = 0.0095), but not with serum complement activity. Our findings indicate that in the reaction between human serum and xenogeneic endothelial cells, it is the concentration of xenoreactive IgM and not differences in complement activity that limits the ensuing pathophysiologic events."

The main objective of this study was to establish reference intervals for normal physiological axillary and palmar sweat production.                                                                              Gravimetric testing was performed in 75 healthy control subjects. Subsequently, these results were compared with findings in a cohort of patients with hyperhidrosis and with the results derived from a review of data on hyperhidrosis published between 1980 and 2013.                                                                              Approximately 90% of the controls had axillary and palmar sweat production rates of below 100 mg/5 min. In all except one of the axillary and palmar hyperhidrosis studies reviewed, average sweat production exceeded 100 mg/5 min.                                                                                      A sweat production rate of 100 mg/5 min as measured by gravimetric testing may be a reasonable cut-off value for distinguishing axillary and palmar hyperhidrosis from normal physiological sweat production."
8592171	"Although the link between tuberculosis (TB) and biologics use is well established, the risk of TB among patients with psoriasis exposed to traditional systemic therapies remains elusive.                                                                                   The aim is to investigate the association between traditional systemic therapies and TB among patients with psoriasis.                                                                              We conducted a retrospective cohort study on the risk of active TB among patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, using the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan, 1996 through 2008. Standardized incidence ratios of TB were analyzed in comparison with age- and gender-matched general population. Logistic regression was used in a nested case-control analysis to estimate the odds ratios of TB related to exposure to traditional systemic agents during the year before TB development.                                                                              Among the 81,266 patients in the psoriasis cohort, 497 new active TB cases were identified. The incidence rate of TB was 102 cases per 100,000 person-years among patients with psoriasis (standardized incidence ratio 1.22, 95% confidence interval 1.18-1.33). The risk of TB was higher in patients with severe disease (standardized incidence ratio 1.52, 95% confidence interval 1.46-1.74). To facilitate comparisons with the 497 active TB cases, a total of 1988 matched control subjects were selected for a nested case-control study. Patients taking systemic corticosteroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were associated with higher incidence of TB, especially frequent users, after adjustment for multiple TB risk factors, drug exposures, hospital visits, and level of urbanization. Stratified analyses of current users and new users of these drugs revealed similar results. Finally, traditional systemic antipsoriatic treatment was not associated with TB on any of the analyses.                                                                                     The National Health Insurance Research Database did not contain information regarding severity of psoriasis, smoking status, alcohol use, diet, laboratory parameters, chest radiograph, or history of recent contact with an individual with TB. Misclassification of disease cannot be ruled out in a registry-based database. The accessibility of health care may be associated with the level of urbanization, which could confound the effect of drugs in multivariate analyses.                                                                                      Severe psoriasis may be associated with an elevated TB risk. Traditional systemic therapies do not seem to be strongly associated with TB occurrence."
9785935	"A quantitative estimation of the amounts of human Ia (HLA-DR) and HLA-ABC antigen on a variety of human tissues was performed. Monoclonal antibodies to species-common determinants of HLA-DR and HLA-ABC antigens were absorbed quantitatively with tissue homogenates and cell suspensions, and reassayed for residual activity in a radioimmunobinding assay. Kidney was found to carry 90% as much HLA-DR and 14% as much HLA-ABC antigen as spleen, while liver contained 19 and 9% as much, respectively. Small amounts of both antigens were found on heart; brain carried very little HLA-ABC and virtually no DR. Neither HLA-ABC nor DR was found on erythrocytes or reticulocytes. Of interest was our finding that a small subpopulation of thymocytes (10%) was HLA-DR positive. Platelets contained approximately 5% of the amount of HLA-ABC as spleen and undetectable quantities of HLA-DR, as expected. Chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL) cells were found to carry 10% as much HLA-ABC and 33% as much DR antigen as spleen, while the values for bone marrow were 15 and 2%, respectively."

The etiopathogenesis of the disease remains unknown. Psoralen plus UVA (PUVA), topical and systemic corticosteroids, etretinate, cyclosporin and interferon are the main approaches in the treatment of this rare disease. A case of PEO in a 60-year-old man who responded to retinoid plus PUVA (Re-PUVA) treatment is reported here and a review of the therapy with other relevant cases is presented."
2896979	"Members of the Whirly family of proteins are found throughout the plant kingdom and are predicted to share the ability to bind to single-stranded DNA. Arabidopsis and potato Whirly orthologs act as transcription factors that regulate defense gene expression; the Arabidopsis Whirly protein AtWhy1 contributes to both basal and specific defense responses. Analysis of the crystal structure of potato StWhy1 has provided insight into the DNA-binding mechanism of this family of proteins, their mode of action and possible autoregulation. There is evidence to suggest that Whirly proteins might play roles in processes other than defense responses and could function in the chloroplast as well as in the nucleus."
9543430	"Extramammary Paget disease (EMPD) is often associated with underlying or distant synchronous malignancies. The prognosis for affected patients is generally favourable; however, the risk of secondary malignancies is unknown.                                                                                   The goal of the study was to analyse the incidence, prognosis and pattern of secondary malignancies for patients with invasive EMPD using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program.                                                                              We searched the SEER Program database for patients diagnosed with invasive EMPD between 1973 and 2008. Demographic data, outcome and secondary malignancies more than 1 year after the initial diagnosis of invasive EMPD were included in the analysis. We calculated the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) and estimated the excess absolute risk (EAR) per 10,000 person-years (PY).                                                                              There were 1439 patients who were diagnosed with invasive EMPD. Most patients (80.4%) had localized disease, while 17.1% had locoregional spread and 2.5% presented with distant disease. The SIR for secondary malignancies in patients with invasive EMPD was significantly elevated with an EAR of 97.4 additional malignancies per 10,000 PY. The excess risk was mostly due to a significantly increased incidence of colorectal and anal malignancies. The initial site of disease predicted the site of the secondary malignancies, with patients with colorectal, anal, vulvar and scrotal disease showing an increased risk of colorectal, anal, vulvar and scrotal malignancies, respectively.                                                                                      Our study identified a long-term increased risk of developing secondary malignancies in patients with invasive EMPD that are mainly related to the site of origin of this disease. Patients with invasive EMPD require prolonged follow-up and screening for these malignancies."
1936859	"The quantification of cynaropicrin in artichoke leaf extracts (ALE) by means of quantitative ¹H NMR was performed. The method relies on solid phase extraction for sample preparation and spectra acquisition in DMSO- D₆ containing anthracene as the internal standard. The obtained ¹H NMR spectra revealed excellent signal purity for H-13(b) of cynaropicrin, which was thus chosen for quantification. Validation was performed in terms of selectivity, linearity, precision, accuracy, and robustness. The content of cynaropicrin in the analyzed samples showed considerable variation, ranging from non detectable to 1.6 %. The NMR approach does not rely on external calibration, which represents the major advantage compared to traditional approaches based on HPLC."

8806646	"To clarify the histogenesis of keratoacanthoma, we studied keratin (K) expression in keratoacanthoma (KA) using 10 different anti-keratin antibodies against K1, K7, K8, K10, K14, K15, K16, K17, K18 and K19 and anti-filaggrin (filament aggregating protein) antibody. In the centre of KA, K1 and K10 expressions were declined, and K14 and K16 were detected in the tumour cells, suggesting differentiation towards the outer root sheath beneath the orifice of the sebaceous duct. These results suggest that KA differentiates towards the outer root sheath beneath the opening of the sebaceous duct."
6729518	"Living tissues possess direct current surface electropotentials that regulate, at least in part, the healing process. Following tissue damage, a current of injury is generated that is thought to trigger biological repair. In addition, exogenous electrical stimuli have been shown to enhance the healing of wounds in both human subjects and animal models. Intractable ulcers have demonstrated accelerated healing and skin wounds have resurfaced faster and with better tensile properties following exposure to electrical currents. This article examines the bioelectric properties of living systems and reviews the existing literature on electrical stimulation and wound healing."
6741523	"A prospective, randomized, multicentre trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of roxithromycin (150 mg b.i.d. orally) and penicillin (2.5 MU x 8 daily intravenously, then 6 MU daily orally) in the treatment of hospitalized adult patients with erysipelas. Seventy-two patients entered the study. Thirty-one patients in the roxithromycin group and 38 patients in the penicillin group completed the trial. The overall efficacy rates (cure without additional antibiotics) were 84% (26/31) in the roxithromycin group and 76% (29/38) in the penicillin group (P = 0.43). No side-effects were observed in the roxithromycin-treated patients whereas rashes occurred in two cases in the penicillin group, leading to exclusion from the study. Oral roxithromycin can thus be considered an effective and well-tolerated treatment for erysipelas in adult hospitalized patients."

A total of 70 patients with primary BMS and 70 control subjects were enrolled in the study. The severity of pain was evaluated with a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Four validated questionnaires were used to investigate the psychological profile of each patient: the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Oral Health Impact Profile-14 (OHIP-14), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (EES).                                                                              Poor sleep quality was present in 67.1% patients with BMS vs. 17.1% in control subjects (P ≤ 0.001). For patients with BMS, total data resulting from the PSQI correlated with results obtained by the EES (P ≤ 0.001), VAS pain (P ≤ 0.001), localization (P = 0.01), HAD-A (P = 0.001) and HAD-D (P = 0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed that an increase of one point in each depression score (HAD-D) made the chances of PSQI 1.26 times more likely, with a 95% confidence interval (CI = 1.03-1.55).

8094934	"Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is an autoimmune blistering disease affecting the mucous membrane and skin. Typically, oral lesions appear before skin lesions, and in a majority of the cases only oral lesions are present. The dentist may then be the first to recognize and diagnose this disease. It is unusual for PV to present over the gingiva as a primary site of involvement. Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation and confirmed by histopathological study. Early diagnosis and management can prevent the uneven life- threatening effects of this potentially chronic mucocutaneous disorder. The case serves to enhance our awareness of the gingiva as a site at which systemic disease can manifest itself."
9426928	"Ramadan fasting for Muslims means abstinence from eating, drinking, and smoking from sunrise to sunset. There are concerns whether the occurrence of renal colic increases during the month of Ramadan. In view of the importance of fasting among Muslims, the occurrence of renal colic during Ramadan fasting has been compared during the following periods: two weeks before commencement of Ramadan (stage-1), during the first two weeks (stage-2), the last two weeks (stage-3), and, two weeks after Ramadan (stage-4). This was a prospective observational study, which was carried out in patients with symptoms of renal colic who were referred to the emergency wards in two major hospitals in Iran. During the study period, 610 subjects were admitted with renal colic during the four periods of study; there were 441 males (72.3%) and 169 females (27.7%). The number of patients with renal colic was highest during the first two weeks of Ramadan in comparison with the other periods (stage-1: 157, stage-2: 195, stage-3: 139, stage-4: 119, P <    0.05]. Results from this study show that the number of admissions due to renal colic was high during the first two weeks of Ramadan. However, the number of admissions decreased during the last two weeks of Ramadan and this trend continued after Ramadan."

To examine whether a short course of narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) improves vitamin D balance.                                                                              Fifty-six healthy, white women (mean age 41 years) volunteered and 53 completed the study. NB-UVB exposures were given on seven consecutive days either on the whole body (n = 19), on the head and arms (n = 9) or on the abdomen (n = 14). Similarly, seven solar simulator exposures were given on the face and arms (n = 11). The cumulative UVB dose was 13 standard erythema doses in all regimens. Serum calcidiol (25-hydroxyvitamin D) concentration was measured by radioimmunoassay before and after the NB-UVB exposures. Follow-up samples were taken from the whole-body NB-UVB group at 2 months.                                                                              At onset 41 women (77%) had vitamin D insufficiency (calcidiol <    50 nmol L(-1)) and six (11%) had vitamin D deficiency (calcidiol <    25 nmol L(-1)). Calcidiol concentration increased significantly, by a mean of 11.4 nmol L(-1) when NB-UVB was given on the whole body, by 11.0 nmol L(-1) when given on the head and arms and by 4.0 nmol L(-1) when given on the abdomen. Solar simulator exposures given on the face and arms increased calcidiol by 3.8 nmol L(-1). After 2 months serum calcidiol was still higher than initially in the group who received NB-UVB exposures on the whole body.                                                                                      NB-UVB exposures given on seven consecutive days on different skin areas of healthy women significantly improved serum calcidiol concentration. A short low-dose NB-UVB course can improve vitamin D balance in winter."
4341196	"An otherwise healthy 71-year-old woman presented with an asymptomatic mass on her right 4th finger that had been slowly enlarging over the past 2 years. On physical examination, there was a tan-pink, freely mobile, rubbery 9-mm papule with a central keratotic plug located over the extensor aspect of the proximal interphalangeal joint of the right 4th finger. A 3-mm punch biopsy of the lesion was performed. Histopathologic findings were consistent with a diagnosis of aggressive digital papillary adenocarcinoma (ADPAca), an adnexal tumor with high metastatic potential that is unfortunately commonly misdiagnosed owing to its rarity and nondescript appearance. Aggressive surgical treatment including radical excision or digital amputation with or without sentinel lymph node biopsy is advocated in the treatment of ADPAca."

8732083	"Fiberglass is used as a reinforcement filler material in printed circuit boards (PCBs) which are widely used in the electronics industry. In a recent survey, we demonstrated that fiberglass dermatitis is the most common occupational dermatosis among electronics industry workers in Taiwan. Little is known, however, about the morphologic structures of the glass fibers which induce dermatitis. The purpose of this study was to assess the morphology of fiber spicules and to determine the relationship of this structure to fiberglass dermatitis.                                                                              Fourteen female patients with a diagnosis of fiberglass dermatitis were selected for study. The diagnosis was confirmed in all patients by positive skin stripping for glass fibers and matching with glass fibers from dust collected in work areas and from samples collected by scraping the edge of PCBs. Samples of collected glass fibers were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).                                                                              SEM of the fiberglass samples revealed that fibers were approximately 10 microm in diameter. In samples from both the edge of PCBs and from dust collected in work areas, SEM revealed that most of the fibers were in bundles of various sizes and lengths. All fibers collected from patients' skin by tape stripping showed a singular spicule, most had a sharp free end, and the lengths were in the range 50-150 microm .                                                                                      Singular glass fibers with a sharp free end and a length of 50-150 microm are most likely to induce fiberglass dermatitis."
9846436	"Psoriasis is a common, chronic skin disorder characterized by hyperproliferation of the epidermis, inflammatory cell accumulation and increased tortuosity and dilatation of dermal papillary blood vessels. Research into the pathogenesis of psoriasis has concentrated mainly on the interplay between inflammatory cells and epidermal proliferation. Central to the proposed pathogenetic pathway are cytokines produced by activated keratinocytes, which are thought to induce both keratinocyte proliferation and lymphocyte migration. Cytokines also mediate upregulation of adhesion molecules on vascular endothelium which in turn permits lymphocyte recruitment. The close spatial relationship between altered microvasculature and epidermis is clearly important in psoriasis. Consequently, understanding the mechanisms underlying vascular changes is fundamental to an elucidation of pathogenetic mechanisms in psoriasis."
4576654	"The development of digitized techniques for manufacturing implant frameworks has made possible alternative ""impression"" techniques for recording implant positions.                                                                                The objective of the present study was to test the precision and accuracy of a three-dimensional photogrammetric technique to record implant positions in vitro and to compare casts made with this technique with conventional casts fabricated with two conventional impression techniques.                                                                                            Twenty casts were fabricated from 10 polyether (Impregum, ESPE Dental AG, Seefeld, Germany) impressions and 10 plaster (Kühns Abdrucksgips, Ernst Hirnischs GmbH, Goslar, Germany) impressions of one master model. The casts were measured in a coordinate measuring machine (Zeiss Prismo VAST, Oberkochen, Germany) and compared with the master model. Six separate three-dimensional photographs of the master model were taken with a special camera. After the photographs were measured with an analytic plotter, results were analyzed and compared to the coordinates of the original model and casts.                                                                              A systematic pattern of distortion in the x-axis was found for the two impression techniques. Expansion of the implant arch at the terminal implants (p <    .01) averaged 22 microm and 94 microm on photographs and plaster casts, respectively. Polyether casts contracted an average of 52 microm when compared with the master (p <    .01). In absolute figures, photogrammetry and the polyether technique reproduced the x-axis and three-dimensional parameters more accurately than the plaster technique did when cylinder center point distortion was compared (p <    .05 to p <    .001). However, angular cylinder distortion in absolute figures was greater with the photographic technique than with either of the impression techniques (p <    .05-p <    .001).                                                                                     Photogrammetry is a valid option for recording implant positions and has a precision comparable to that of conventional impression techniques. At present, however, it is limited to framework fabrication techniques that are based on digital platforms."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of pre-OLT lamivudine-resistance on the post-OLT prognosis of recipients.                                                                                           Consecutive OLT recipient at a single tertiary care center (n = 8) between September 1999 and August 2009 were tested preoperatively for genotypic lamivudine resistance. We compared overall survival as well as incidences of graft failure, recurrent hepatitis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) between patients with (n = 35) versus without (n = 46) lamivudine-resistance.                                                                              Mortality occurred in 2 resistant and 3 nonresistant individuals. The occurrences of graft failure, recurrent hepatitis, and HCC were 1, 2, and 2 cases, respectively, in the resistance group versus 2, 2, and 2 cases, respectively, in the nonresistance cohort. Univariate analysis showed no significant difference in survival, graft failure, HCC occurrence, and recurrent hepatitis.                                                                                      Our results indicated that pre-OLT lamivudine-resistance did not significantly affect the post-OLT prognosis. Thus, lamivudine-resistance may not be a barrier when considering OLT in patients with underlying CHB as a therapeutic modality, if it is treated with appropriate antiviral agents."

However, recent genetic studies have revealed novel functions for TRX m in meristem development, chloroplast morphology, cyclic electron flow, and tetrapyrrole synthesis. The focus of this study is on the putative role of TRX m1, TRX m2, and TRX m4 in the biogenesis of the photosynthetic apparatus in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). To that end, we investigated the impact of single, double, and triple TRX m deficiency on chloroplast development and the accumulation of thylakoid protein complexes. Intriguingly, only inactivation of three TRX m genes led to pale-green leaves and specifically reduced stability of the photosystem II (PSII) complex, implying functional redundancy between three TRX m isoforms. In addition, plants silenced for three TRX m genes displayed elevated levels of reactive oxygen species, which in turn interrupted the transcription of photosynthesis-related nuclear genes but not the expression of chloroplast-encoded PSII core proteins. To dissect the function of TRX m in PSII biogenesis, we showed that TRX m1, TRX m2, and TRX m4 interact physically with minor PSII assembly intermediates as well as with PSII core subunits D1, D2, and CP47. Furthermore, silencing three TRX m genes disrupted the redox status of intermolecular disulfide bonds in PSII core proteins, most notably resulting in elevated accumulation of oxidized CP47 oligomers. Taken together, our results suggest an important role for TRX m1, TRX m2, and TRX m4 proteins in the biogenesis of PSII, and they appear to assist the assembly of CP47 into PSII."
6247504	"Astaxanthin is a high value carotenoid produced by some bacteria, a few green algae, several fungi but only a limited number of plants from the genus Adonis. Astaxanthin has been industrially exploited as a feed supplement in poultry farming and aquaculture. Consumption of ketocarotenoids, most notably astaxanthin, is also increasingly associated with a wide range of health benefits, as demonstrated in numerous clinical studies. Currently astaxanthin is produced commercially by chemical synthesis or from algal production systems. Several studies have used a metabolic engineering approach to produce astaxanthin in transgenic plants. Previous attempts to produce transgenic potato tubers biofortified with astaxanthin have met with limited success. In this study we have investigated approaches to optimising tuber astaxanthin content. It is demonstrated that the selection of appropriate parental genotype for transgenic approaches and stacking carotenoid biosynthetic pathway genes with the cauliflower Or gene result in enhanced astaxanthin content, to give six-fold higher tuber astaxanthin content than has been achieved previously. Additionally we demonstrate the effects of growth environment on tuber carotenoid content in both wild type and astaxanthin-producing transgenic lines and describe the associated transcriptome and metabolome restructuring."
9085433	"To compare the biomechanical fixation and histomorphometric parameters between two implant surfaces: non-washed resorbable blasting media (NWRBM) and alumina-blasted/acid-etched (AB/AE), in a dog model.                                                                                           The surface topography was assessed by scanning electron microscopy, optical interferometry and chemistry by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Six beagle dogs of ∼1.5 years of age were utilized and each animal received one implant of each surface per limb (distal radii sites). After a healing period of 3 weeks, the animals were euthanized and half of the implants were biomechanically tested (removal torque) and the other half was referred to nondecalcified histology processing. Histomorphometric analysis considered bone-to-implant contact (BIC) and bone area fraction occupancy (BAFO). Following data normality check with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, statistical analysis was performed by paired t-tests at 95% level of significance.                                                                              Surface roughness parameters S(a) (average surface roughness) and S(q) (mean root square of the surface) were significantly lower for the NWRBM compared with AB/AE. The XPS spectra revealed the presence of Ca and P in the NWRBM. While no significant differences were observed for both BIC and BAFO parameters (P>   0.35 and P>   0.11, respectively), a significantly higher level of torque was observed for the NWRBM group (P=0.01). Bone morphology was similar between groups, which presented newly formed woven bone in proximity with the implant surfaces.                                                                                     A significant increase in early biomechanical fixation was observed for implants presenting the NWRBM surface."
4640636	"This is a short review of tolerance from the point of view of the clinician. Various examples of tolerance occurring in patients and animal models that relate to the clinical experience are described. There may be different mechanisms by which tolerance is achieved, but from the patient's point of view operational tolerance is the goal whereby, after a short induction procedure, the patient will maintain good function in the grafted organ indefinitely without maintenance immunosuppression. Such a goal may be difficult to achieve with any given protocol because of the enormous variation between donors and recipients of organ grafts in tissue matching, innate immune reactivity, and susceptibility to disturbance of a tolerant state by infections or allergic reactions. Thus the case is made for prope or ""almost"" tolerance in which graft acceptance is maintained by a low, nontoxic dosage of maintenance immunosuppression that may not be required indefinitely."
9776146	"Cytokine-induced expression of inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS) and production of nitric oxide (NO) by pancreatic islet cells has been suggested as one potential mechanism for beta cell destruction. In this study, we investigated the role of iNOS and NO in islet primary non-function. Islets were assessed for their function, viability and expression of iNOS. Adult rat and pig islets isolated by collagenase digestion and fetal pig pancreas (FPP) grafts isolated by collagenase digestion or high oxygen culture were transplanted into C57BL6 mice and nude mice. iNOS protein was detected by immunohistochemistry. iNOS protein was found in normal rat and pig pancreas and adult rat and pig islets that were isolated by collagenase digestion and transplanted into either C57BL6 mice or nude mice. iNOS was not detected in fetal pig islet grafts, regardless of whether collagenase was used in the isolation process. In adult pig islet grafts, the presence of iNOS protein correlated with high levels of islet cell apoptosis and primary non-function. Despite the persistent presence of iNOS in rat islets, there was no evidence that it had a deleterious effect on rat islet viability, or function. Therefore, in isolated adult pig islets, there was a correlation between iNOS expression and apoptosis, suggesting that iNOS activation may be deleterious to the adult pig islets. However, other factors such as the fragility of the islet capsule may be equally important. By contrast, fetal pig islets did not express iNOS and this may be an important reason for their enhanced viability when compared with adult islet tissue."
4580263	"Dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria (DSH) is a hereditary skin disease characterized by the presence of pigmented and hypopigmented macules on the extremities and freckles on the face. However, if clinical features are not fully developed in infantile patients, it is difficult to differentiate DSH from xeroderma pigmentosum by clinical features alone. A 2-year-old boy (patient 1), revealed atypical features of DSH with slight susceptibility to sunburn. However, his grandfather (patient 4) who was 67 years old, revealed typical features of DSH, which helped to make an exact diagnosis in patient 1. For patient 2, a 5-year-old boy, and patient 3, a 3-year-old girl, it was more difficult to make a diagnosis because there were no family members with DSH features. DNA repair ability was tested for all four cases by means of unscheduled DNA synthesis and colony formation of skin fibroblasts after ultraviolet light irradiation, which resulted in an accurate diagnosis of DSH. We propose that these tests be performed to make a diagnosis of DSH in the case of poor or atypical clinical symptoms."
6359634	"The association of acanthosis nigricans, skin tags, diabetes mellitus due to insulin resistance, and obesity in adolescents and young adults represents a well defined syndrome. Hyperandrogenism may also be present. The endocrine origin of this condition is beyond doubt. Insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1, and their receptors on keratinocytes are obviously involved in the complex regulations leading to the peculiar epidermal hyperplasia. This condition is unrelated to other types of acanthosis nigricans, including the congenital and the paraneoplastic types. Control of obesity contributes largely to reverse the whole process, essentially by reducing both insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia. Several drugs including metformin, octreotide, retinoids and topical colecalciferol (vitamin D(3)) analogs are also beneficial in clearing acanthosis nigricans."
4381883	"A right liver graft without the middle hepatic vein (MHV) trunk is now commonly used in living-donor liver transplantation for adult patients. The significance of MHV reconstruction on regeneration or functional recovery of right liver grafts after living-donor liver transplantation, however, remains unclear.                                                                              From 2000 to 2002 at the University of Tokyo Hospital in Tokyo, Japan, 56 adult patients received a right liver graft. The patients were divided into three groups by graft type: right liver graft without MHV trunk or MHV reconstruction (n=17); right liver graft without MHV trunk, but with MHV reconstruction (n=27); and extended right liver graft (n=12). Regeneration rate and postoperative liver function were compared among groups. Predictive factors associated with the graft regeneration were identified among clinical variables, including the graft type.                                                                              The regeneration rate of the right paramedian sector and the whole graft was lowest in the right liver grafts without the MHV trunk or MHV reconstruction. The regeneration rate of the lateral sector was highest in this type of graft, but the difference was not statistically significant. The factors that significantly correlated with the regeneration rate were preoperative graft volume and graft type. There was no significant difference among groups in any of the liver function parameters.                                                                                      In the present series, satisfactory outcome was independent of the type of graft used, which indicates that MHV reconstruction should not be omitted routinely but should be performed in selected patients."
7355459	"Linear IgA disease (LAD) has been associated with a variety of drugs over the past 30 years.                                                                                  To review current literature on all available cases of drug-induced LAD, in order to ascertain whether a close relationship is justified, so that it constitutes a real and separate nosological entity.                                                                              The PubMed database was searched for all articles written in English related to drug-induced LAD published between January 1980 and December 2010.                                                                              The literature review shows that at least 84 articles were published, describing a total of 103 patients. Of these articles, only 46, from 13 countries, were included in this analysis, with a total of 52 patients: 24 (46.2%) were believed to be induced by vancomycin and 28 (53.8%) by drugs other than vancomycin. Challenge-dechallenge-rechallenge testing protocol was performed on only 6 (11.5%) of 52 patients, of which only 5 showed a positive result, while the Naranjo algorithm was performed on only 2 of them (0.3%).                                                                                      The evidence of this review analysis is based only on case reports. No study on large samples of drug-induced LAD is currently available.                                                                                      The literature analysis reveals no strong scientific evidence to support the notion that some drugs have induced LAD; therefore in many reviewed cases, we must question whether drug-induced LAD is really the underlying entity. Further and thorough investigations using one of the available algorithms for adverse drug reaction are warranted."
5746966	"Warts occur commonly in humans. Destructive modalities are generally the first physician-administered therapy. Other treatment options include immunotherapy. Intralesional immunotherapy using mumps, Candida, or Trichophyton skin test antigens has proved efficacy in the treatment of warts.                                                                                   To determine rates of wart resolution in response to injection of antigen alone, antigen plus interferon alfa-2b, interferon alfa-2b alone, and normal saline; and to compare response according to viral type, major histocompatibility complex antigens, and peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation to autologous human papillomavirus antigen before and after injection.                                                                             Randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled, clinical trial.                                                                              Medical school-based dermatology department.                                                                               Two hundred thirty-three patients clinically diagnosed as having 1 or more warts. Main Outcome Measure Clinical resolution of warts in response to intralesional immunotherapy.                                                                              Responders were observed in all treatment arms, but were significantly more likely to have received antigen (P<   .001). Resolution of distant untreated warts was observed, and was significantly more likely in subjects receiving antigen (P<   .001). Interferon did not significantly enhance the response rate (P = .20) and did not differ from normal saline (P = .65). No viral type or major histocompatibility complex antigen correlated with response or lack of response (P>   .99 and P = .86, respectively). A positive peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation assay result (2 times pretreatment levels) was significantly more likely among responders (P = .002). While there was no significant difference in response based on sex (P = .56), older subjects (>   40 years) were less likely to respond (P = .01).                                                                                      Intralesional immunotherapy using injection of Candida, mumps, or Trichophyton skin test antigens is an effective treatment for warts, as indicated by significantly higher response rates and distant response rates in subjects receiving antigen. Viral type and major histocompatibility complex antigens did not seem to influence treatment response. Response is accompanied by proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to human papillomavirus antigens, suggesting that a human papillomavirus-directed cell-mediated immune response plays a role in wart resolution."

We report the case of a 5-year-old girl who presented with erythematous scaly plaques, with scarring alopecia, involving approximately 40% of her scalp. Histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of DLE. Treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone, hydroxychloroquine, oral prednisone, topical corticosteroids, and sunscreen lead to reversal of scarring alopecia and re-growth of hair."

The histopathology revealed a lobular neoplasm with a biphasic pattern of spindle shaped cells and hemangiopericytoma like areas at the periphery of the lobule. The diagnosis of adult cutaneous myofibroma was made. This case highlights the importance of histopathology in reaching a definitive diagnosis."
6342270	"Orthotopic liver transplantation has been traditionally associated with major blood loss and the need for allogenic blood product transfusions. In recent years, improvements in surgical and anesthetic techniques have greatly decreased the amount of blood products transfused. We have published a median of 0 for all intraoperative blood products transfused. Some authors argue that these results could be possible merely because of the relatively healthy cohort in terms of model of end-stage liver disease (MELD) score. The MELD score could be adjusted by some conditions (hepatocellular carcinoma, hemodialysis, hepatopulmonary syndrome, and amyloidosis) and was not adjusted in these series. The goal of this work was to verify the MELD score according to US standards and to find any link between the MELD score and the transfusion rate.                                                                             Three hundred fifty consecutive liver transplantations were studied. The MELD score was adjusted according to US standards. Patients were divided into two groups according to the median of the MELD score. Blood loss and transfusion rate were determined for these two groups. Logistic regression models were used to find any link with transfusion of red blood cell (RBC) units.                                                                             The MELD score before adjusting was 19+/-9 and 22+/-10 after. A mean of 0.5+/-1.3 RBC units/patient intraoperative were transfused with 80.6% of cases without any blood products. There was no difference for the blood loss (999+/-670 mL vs. 1017+/-885 mL) or the transfusion rate (0.4+/-1.2 vs. 0.5+/-1.4 RBC/patient) between two groups of MELD (<   21 or >   or=21) or any of its component (creatinine, bilirubin, and international normalized ratio). The logistic regression analysis found that only two variables were linked to RBC transfusion; starting hemoglobin value and phlebotomy.                                                                                     In this series, the MELD score was as high as US series and did not predict blood losses and blood product requirement during liver transplantation. If the MELD system has to be implemented to prioritize orthotopic liver transplantation, it should be revisited, and the starting hemoglobin value should be added to the equation."
6884389	"A 36-year-old woman presented with a 2-year history of multiple, raised, brown papules and indurated skin over her lower legs. She had received a renal transplant 11 years earlier, and had a history of recurrent deep vein thromboses despite a negative thrombophilic screen. The patient had no history of exposure to gadolinium. Histology at this time revealed a light perivascular lymphoid infiltrate, activated fibroblasts and prominent capillary vessels. The patient re-presented 1 year later with persistence of these lesions, in the setting of worsening renal function requiring haemodialysis. Repeat skin biopsies demonstrated increased dermal collagen and angiogenesis. The dermatopathological findings, in association with renal insufficiency and multiple deep vein thromboses, led to the diagnosis of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis."
8229325	"Malignant melanoma has the highest propensity to metastasize to the brain of all primary neoplasms in adults. Here, we describe invasive growth and the development of melanoma metastases from suspensions of human melanoma cells in the brain of the chick embryo. Patient-derived melanoma cells and established melanoma cell lines were injected into the rhombencephalic brain vesicle of the two-day-chick embryo. After 48 and 96 h, tumor formation was studied in serial paraffin sections with melanoma-specific HMB45 and human-specific MIB1 proliferation markers. The majority of the cells injected into the embryonic liquor cavity perished. Only melanoma cells in newly formed aggregates or when attached to the dorsal roof plate escaped apoptosis. Local invasion occurred not in the ventral differentiating neural epithelium but only in the roof plate. Although after 48 h melanoma cells invaded the rhombencephalic roof plate profusely at both sides, after 96 h typically one large tumor developed in the midline between roof plate and the dorsal surface epithelium. From the tumor, single cells invaded the mesenchyme and blood vessels. Cell lines with different invasive properties retained their graded invasive behaviour. Maximally invasive cells formed continuous tracks via vessels and along nerve fibres. The central tumor in the roof plate of the chick embryo rhombencephalon resembles a metastatic nodule in the patients with melanoma. Penetration of the roof plate epithelium, tumor formation and invasion of surrounding tissues by single cells can reliably be reproduced. The chick embryo model can be used for molecular studies of early phases of melanoma brain metastasis."
2867769	"The pea pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. pisi is able to detoxify pisatin produced as a defense response by pea, and the gene encoding this detoxification mechanism, FoPDA1, was 82% identical to the cytochrome P450 pisatin demethylase PDA1 gene in Nectria haematococca. A survey of F. oxysporum f. sp. pisi isolates demonstrated that, as in N. haematococca, the PDA gene of F. oxysporum f. sp. pisi is generally located on a small chromosome. In N. haematococca, PDA1 is in a cluster of pea pathogenicity (PEP) genes. Homologs of these PEP genes also were found in the F. oxysporum f. sp. pisi isolates, and PEP1 and PEP5 were sometimes located on the same small chromosomes as the FoPDA1 homologs. Transforming FoPDA1 into a pda(?) F. oxysporum f. sp. lini isolate conferred pda activity and promoted pathogenicity on pea to some transformants. Different hybridization patterns of FoPDA1 were found in F. oxysporum f. sp. pisi but these did not correlate with the races of the fungus, suggesting that races within this forma specialis arose independently of FoPDA1. FoPDA1 also was present in the formae speciales lini, glycines, and dianthi of F. oxysporum but they had mutations resulting in nonfunctional proteins. However, an active FoPDA1 was present in F. oxysporum f. sp. phaseoli and it was virulent on pea. Despite their evolutionary distance, the amino acid sequences of FoPDA1 of F. oxysporum f. sp. pisi and F. oxysporum f. sp. phaseoli revealed only six amino acid differences, consistent with a horizontal gene transfer event accounting for the origin of these genes."
5421186	"Nonbullous neutrophilic dermatoses are seen infrequently in association with lupus erythematosus (LE). A recently described histopathologic variant of Sweet syndrome, to our knowledge, histiocytoid Sweet syndrome (HSS) has not been described in either pediatric or adult patients with LE.                                                                                   We describe 2 pediatric patients with nonbullous histiocytoid neutrophilic dermatitis in the setting of LE. One case represents the initial presentation of subacute cutaneous LE, while the other case represents a manifestation of established systemic LE. Both cases demonstrate histopathologic findings of HSS.                                                                                      We believe that the dermatosis observed in these 2 patients represents a nonbullous histiocytoid neutrophilic dermatosis that is best termed HSS. This entity may represent a distinct and important cutaneous manifestation of LE. Additional study is needed to further elucidate the relationship between neutrophilic dermatitis and LE."
5782927	"There are more than 250 transplant centers in the USA, but variation continues to exist in organizational structure for transplant multidisciplinary services. We reviewed the literature to explore the definitions for transplant organizational structures and address existing rationale for the development of the integrated transplant service line.                                                                                      No standard definitions exist to differentiate the use of program, center, institute, or service line. A survey of 20 multiorgan transplant centers in the USA showed that most were named centers or institutes, but some were organized as departments and service lines. The prevailing themes were the perceived need for autonomy of the transplant entity, alignment among services and finances, and the alignment of authority with responsibility. In addition, perceived benefits included growth, alignment, efficiency, and resource allocation.                                                                                  The multidisciplinary nature of transplantation generally has been fit into the matrix organizational model, although many hospitals today have departments, centers, institutes, and service lines structures. Integration has been viewed as beneficial by most transplant entities reviewed, with a sense that it is better adapted for the evolving healthcare climate."
2763623	"A fungal gene encoding a transcription factor is expressed from its own promoter in Arabidopsis phloem and improves drought tolerance by reducing transpiration and increasing osmotic potential. Horizontal gene transfer from unrelated organisms has occurred in the course of plant evolution, suggesting that some foreign genes may be useful to plants. The CtHSR1 gene, previously isolated from the halophytic yeast Candida tropicalis, encodes a heat-shock transcription factor-related protein. CtHSR1, with expression driven by its own promoter or by the Arabidopsis UBQ10 promoter, was introduced into the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation and the resulting transgenic plants were more tolerant to drought than controls. Fusions of the CtHSR1 promoter with β-glucuronidase reporter gene indicated that this fungal promoter drives expression to phloem tissues. A chimera of CtHSR1 and green fluorescence protein is localized at the cell nucleus. The physiological mechanism of drought tolerance in transgenic plants is based on reduced transpiration (which correlates with decreased opening of stomata and increased levels of jasmonic acid) and increased osmotic potential (which correlates with increased proline accumulation). Transcriptomic analysis indicates that the CtHSR1 transgenic plants overexpressed a hundred of genes, including many relevant to stress defense such as LOX4 (involved in jasmonic acid synthesis) and P5CS1 (involved in proline biosynthesis). The promoters of the induced genes were enriched in upstream activating sequences for water stress induction. These results demonstrate that genes from unrelated organisms can have functional expression in plants from its own promoter and expand the possibilities of useful transgenes for plant biotechnology."
4827249	"Mechanical irritation of trigger hairs and subsequent generation of action potentials have significant impact on photosynthesis and respiration in carnivorous Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula). Action potential-mediated inhibition of photosynthesis and stimulation of respiration is confined only to the trap and was not recorded in adjacent photosynthetic lamina. We showed that the main primary target of electrical signals on assimilation is in the dark enzymatic reaction of photosynthesis. Without doubt, the electrical signaling is costly, and the possible co-existence of such type of signals and photosynthesis in plant cell is discussed."
9634376	"Unlike other eukaryotes, which synthesize polyamines (PA) only from ornithine, plants possess an additional pathway utilizing arginine as a precursor. In this study, we have identified cDNA clones coding for a Glycine max ornithine decarboxylase (ODC, EC 4.1.1.7) and an arginine decarboxylase (ADC, EC 4.1.1.19). Expression analysis using semi-quantitative RT-PCR approach revealed that both genes coding for enzymes involved in putrescine biosynthesis (ODC and ADC) were found in most plant organs examined. Significant expression levels of both genes were detected in root tips and hypocotyls. The spatial distribution of GmODC and GmADC transcripts in primary and lateral roots and hypocotyls revealed that these genes are co-expressed in expanding cells of cortex parenchyma, expanding cells of central cylinder in main roots and in developing tissues and expanding cells of soybean hypocotyls. The data point out a correlation of the expression patterns of GmODC and GmADC gene to certain physiological roles such as organ development and cell expansion."

Thirty immediate transmucosal implants in maxillary anterior extraction sites of 30 patients randomly received BioOss (N=10; BG), BioOss and resorbable collagen membrane (N=10; BG+M) or no graft (N=10; control).                                                                              Vertical defect height (VDH) reductions of 81.2+/-5%, 70.5+/-17.4% and 68.2+/-16.6%, and horizontal defect depth (HDD) reductions of 71.7+/-34.3%, 81.7+/-33.7% and 55+/-28.4% were observed for BG, BG+M and control groups, respectively, with no significant inter-group differences. Horizontal resorption was significantly greater in control group (48.3+/-9.5%) when compared with BG (15.8+/-16.9%) and BG+M (20+/-21.9%) groups (P=0.000). Ten sites (33.3%) exhibited recession of the mucosa after 6 months; eight (26.7%) had an unsatisfactory esthetic result post-restoration due to recession. Mucosal recession was significantly associated (P=0.032) with buccally positioned implants (HDD 1.1+/-0.3 mm) when compared with lingually positioned implants (HDD 2.3+/-0.6 mm). In 19 patients followed for a mean of 4.0+/-0.7 years, marginal mucosa and bone levels remained stable following restoration.                                                                                     BioOss significantly reduced horizontal resorption of buccal bone. There is a risk of mucosal recession and adverse soft tissue esthetics with immediate implant placement. However, this risk may be reduced by avoiding a buccal position of the implant in the extraction socket."
1059564	"The roles of the phytotoxin coronatine (COR) and salicylic acid (SA)-mediated defenses in the interaction of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) were investigated. Unlike findings reported for Arabidopsis thaliana, DC3000 mutants impaired for production of COR or one of its components, coronafacic acid (CFA) or coronamic acid (CMA), induced distinctly different disease lesion phenotypes in tomato. Tomato plants inoculated with the CFA- CMA- mutant DB29 showed elevated transcript levels of SlICS, which encodes isochorismate synthase, an enzyme involved in SA biosynthesis in S. lycopersicum. Furthermore, expression of genes encoding SA-mediated defense proteins were elevated in DB29-inoculated plants compared with plants inoculated with DC3000, suggesting that COR suppresses SlICS-mediated SA responses. Sequence analysis of SlICS revealed that it encodes a protein that is 55 and 59.6% identical to the A. thaliana ICS-encoded proteins AtICS1 and AtICS2, respectively. Tomato plants silenced for SlICS were hypersusceptible to DC3000 and accumulated lower levels of SA after infection with DC3000 compared with inoculated wild-type tomato plants. Unlike what has been shown for A. thaliana, the COR- mutant DB29 was impaired for persistence in SlICS-silenced tomato plants; thus, COR has additional roles in virulence that are SA independent and important in the latter stages of disease development. In summary, the infection assays, metabolic profiling, and gene expression results described in this study indicate that the intact COR molecule is required for both suppression of SA-mediated defense responses and full disease symptom development in tomato."
4041572	"Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a serious complication of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from an HLA-identical sibling. There is no practical test before transplantation that gives sufficient information to predict the degree of allogeneic reactivity between HLA-identical siblings. We determined the frequency with which host-specific interleukin-2 (IL-2) -secreting donor T lymphocyte precursors (Tl-p) occurred in 16 pairs of HLA-identical siblings before they underwent marrow grafting. The results were correlated with the development of acute GVHD after BMT. We further analyzed the responding host (and donor) -specific Tl-p with respect to the cell surface phenotype, the influence of previous in vivo priming, and the MHC class restriction of minor histocompatibility (mH) antigen recognition. To investigate whether host-reactive Tl-p are involved in the induction of acute GVHD, we also examined the frequency of host-specific Tl-p at various time intervals after BMT in 14 patients with and without acute GVHD. High frequencies of host-specific Tl-p were detectable before BMT in 8 donors whose siblings later had severe (grade II or III) acute GVHD. Among the donors to 8 patients with mild (grade 0 or I) acute GVHD, low frequencies were found. Various T-cell subsets contributed to the responding Tl-p. The presence of host-specific Tl-p after BMT was significantly correlated with the development of serious (grade II or III) acute GVHD. We conclude that host-specific IL-2-secreting T cells are critically involved in the induction and maintenance of acute GVHD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
1849845	"Rose bush architecture, among other factors, such as plant health, determines plant visual quality. The commercial product is the individual plant and interplant variability may be high within a crop. Thus, both mean plant architecture and interplant variability should be studied. Expansion is an important feature of architecture, but it has been little studied at the level of individual organs in rose bushes. We investigated the expansion kinetics of primary shoot organs, to develop a model reproducing the organ expansion of real crops from non-destructive input variables. We took interplant variability in expansion kinetics and the model's ability to simulate this variability into account. Changes in leaflet and internode dimensions over thermal time were recorded for primary shoot expansion, on 83 plants from three crops grown in different climatic conditions and densities. An empirical model was developed, to reproduce organ expansion kinetics for individual plants of a real crop of rose bush primary shoots. Leaflet or internode length was simulated as a logistic function of thermal time. The model was evaluated by cross-validation. We found that differences in leaflet or internode expansion kinetics between phytomer positions and between plants at a given phytomer position were due mostly to large differences in time of organ expansion and expansion rate, rather than differences in expansion duration. Thus, in the model, the parameters linked to expansion duration were predicted by values common to all plants, whereas variability in final size and organ expansion time was captured by input data. The model accurately simulated leaflet and internode expansion for individual plants (RMSEP = 7.3 and 10.2% of final length, respectively). Thus, this study defines the measurements required to simulate expansion and provides the first model simulating organ expansion in rosebush to capture interplant variability."
3991241	"Two cDNA clones encoding polyphenol oxidases were isolated from a cDNA library constructed from a log-phase suspension culture of Phytolacca americana (pokeweed) producing betalains. The clones exhibit 93 and 86% sequence identity at the nucleotide and deduced amino acid levels, respectively. Both clones contain two copper-binding domains characterized by histidine-rich regions, which are found ubiquitously in all polyphenol oxidases/tyrosinases, and a putative third histidine-rich, copper-binding region, which is common to all plant polyphenol oxidases. One of the Phytolacca cDNA deduced amino acid sequences contains the ubiquitous transit peptide for all proteins targeted to the internal lumen of thylakoid membranes of plastids and is considered to be 98 residues in length based on a proposed sequence cleavage site motif. This would produce a processed peptide of approximately 54 kD. In addition to common features of transit peptides, it was found that an additional conserved region for polyphenol oxidases was located between the hydroxy amino acid-rich region and the thylakoid transfer domain. Spatial and temporal expression was investigated by northern blot analysis of total RNA from various organs of Phytolacca plants. Transcripts of the two clones were found to be 2.1 and 2.3 kb, respectively. Both transcripts were present only at substantial levels in ripening, betalain-containing fruit."

6019079	"1. HLA antigens on platelets can be detected by alloantisera used for typing lymphocytes. 2. There is a general correlation between reactivity of sera against platelets and reactivity against T cells. However, some SLE patients have broadly reactive antibodies to T cells that are much less reactive to platelets. These sera may contain IgG autoantibody to non-HLA T-cell autoantigens. 3. The Pl-FCXM may be both more sensitive than the conventional cytotoxic crossmatching techniques and more discriminating than the T-FCXM in detecting relevant deleterious antibodies. All 11 patients with a negative platelet FXCM had functioning kidneys at 1 month, whereas 7 of 12 patients with a positive Pl-FCXM had nonfunctional kidneys at 1 month (p = 0.003). 4. It is suggested that the Pl-FCXM offers a simple, sensitive, and effective method of crossmatching without the high false positive rate of T-FCXM."

One thousand construction workers, including 467 migrant laborers, were examined for various dermatoses.                                                                              Most (88%) workers were males and 51.17% were in their third decade. Infective and noninfective dermatoses were seen in 89.72% and 53.74% of laborers respectively. Among infective dermatoses, fungal infections were the most common (46.25%) ones, followed by bacterial infections (24.83%), scabies (8.56%) and viral infections (6.42%). Contact dermatitis to cement was seen in 12.48% of the laborers. Masons had a significantly higher incidence of contact dermatitis to cement, viral infections and scabies than helpers.

5656541	"Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a warm-season perennial grass that has received considerable attention as a potential dedicated biofuel and bioproduct feedstock. Genetic improvement of switchgrass is needed for better cellulosic ethanol production, especially to improve cellulose-to-lignin ratios. Cell suspension cultures offer an in vitro system for mutant selection, mass propagation, gene transfer, and cell biology. Toward this end, switchgrass cell suspension cultures were initiated from embryogenic callus obtained from genotype Alamo 2. They have been established and characterized with different cell type morphologies: sandy, fine milky, and ultrafine cultures. Characterization includes histological analysis using scanning electron microscopy, and utility using protoplast isolation. A high protoplast isolation rate of up to 10(6) protoplasts/1.0g of cells was achieved for the fine milky culture, whereas only a few protoplasts were isolated for the sandy and ultrafine cultures. These results indicate that switchgrass cell suspension type sizably impacts the efficiency of protoplast isolation, suggesting its significance in other applications. The establishment of different switchgrass suspension culture cell types provides the opportunity to gain insights into the versatility of the system that would further augment switchgrass biology research."
7248804	"Chlorophyll and anthocyanin contents provide a valuable indicator of the status of a plant's physiology, but to be more widely utilized it needs to be assessed easily and non-destructively. This is particularly evident in terms of assessing and exploiting germplasm for plant-breeding programs. We report, for the first time, experiments with Fragaria chiloensis (L.) Duch. and the estimation of the effects of response to salinity stress (0, 30, and 60 mmol NaCl/L) in terms of these pigments content and gas exchange. It is shown that both pigments (which interestingly, themselves show a high correlation) give a good indication of stress response. Both pigments can be accurately predicted using spectral reflectance indices (SRI); however, the accuracy of the predictions was slightly improved using multilinear regression analysis models and genetic algorithm analysis. Specifically for chlorophyll content, unlike other species, the use of published SRI gave better indications of stress response than Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. The effect of salt on gas exchange is only evident at the highest concentration and some SRI gave better prediction performance than the known Photochemical Reflectance Index. This information will therefore be useful for identifying tolerant genotypes to salt stress for incorporation in breeding programs."
7705842	"Acne is occurring more frequently in younger age groups, but most available treatments are considered off-label in young children. As the epidemiology of acne has changed to include younger children over the past 20 years, neither regulators, pharmaceutical companies, nor clinicians have understood the need or value of obtaining regulatory sanctions for problems physicians have managed using clinical judgment. The objective of this study was to analyze the frequency of off-label acne treatment according to age and other demographic factors. We searched the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from 1993 to 2010 for visits in children younger than 12 years of age for the diagnosis of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, code 706.1. We tabulated leading acne treatments and assessed factors associated with off-label prescribing. Off-label but appropriate acne treatments were used in 29% of acne visits for children younger than 12 years of age. Dermatologists were more likely than pediatricians to prescribe off-label treatment (p <    0.001). The most frequently used off-label treatments were topical retinoids, followed by oral antibiotics. There was no significant trend in the rate of off-label prescribing over time (p = 0.40). Off-label treatment is well within the standard of care for young children with acne. More data on the use of topical retinoids in young children will improve our understanding of their use, which may help optimize treatment outcomes for children with acne."
7497495	"A multivariate approach to the study of relationships between quality of life and demographic, physical, and psychosocial variables after heart transplantation has not been examined in a large, multi-site sample. The purpose of this study was to describe quality of life, examine relationships between quality of life and demographic, physical, and psychosocial variables, and identify predictors of quality of life in patients who were 1 year post heart transplantation.                                                                              Data were collected from a nonrandom sample of adult patients (n = 232) who were 1 year post heart transplantation at a Midwestern or Southern medical center. Nine self-administered instruments and chart review were used to gather data from patients. All tools had adequate psychometric support. Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlations, and step-wise multiple regression were used to analyze data. Level of significance was set at 0.05.                                                                              Patients were most satisfied with the areas of quality of life regarding social interaction and least satisfied with their psychological state. Patients experienced an average amount of stress, were coping fairly well, reported overall good quality of life, and were very satisfied with the outcome of their transplant surgery. Nine out of 16 variables were significant predictors of quality of life and explained 66% of the variance in quality of life: less stress, more helpfulness of information from health care providers, better health perception, better compliance with the transplant regimen, more effective coping, less functional disability, less symptom distress, older age, and fewer complications.                                                                                      Predictors of quality of life at 1 year after heart transplantation were primarily psychological. Additional variance in quality of life was explained by physical, somatic sensation, demographic, and health status variables. Knowledge of these factors provides (1) information to identify patients who are at risk for poor quality of life at 1 year after heart transplantation and (2) direction for the development of interventions to improve quality of life."

These were further separated by picture type into 'skin contact' (e.g. ants crawling on the hand or a butterfly on a finger), 'skin response' (e.g. scratching an insect bite or washing the hands) or 'context only' (e.g. viewing midges or birds flying).                                                                               The sensation of itch was successfully generated using itch-related pictures, with higher self-reports of itch in answer to the questions 'How itchy do you feel?' and 'How itchy do you think the person in the picture feels?', compared with viewing neutral pictures (P<   0·001), and these measures correlated (P≤ 0·003). Participants also scratched themselves more when viewing itch-related pictures than when viewing neutral ones (P<   0·001). The interaction with picture type was significant, with more scratching behaviour recorded when viewing pictures depicting others scratching (P=0·01).                                                                                        This study demonstrates the impact of visual cues in eliciting sensations of itch and provoking a scratch response, and may provide behavioural evidence linking contagious itch to the mirror neuron system."

3690023	"Crigler-Najjar type 1 disease is a rare inherited metabolic disease characterized by high levels of unconjugated bilirubin due to the complete absence of hepatic uridine diphosphoglucuronate-glucuronosyltransferase activity. Hepatocyte transplantation (HT) has been proposed as an alternative treatment for Crigler-Najjar syndrome, but it is still limited by the quality and the low engraftment and repopulation ability of the cells used. Because of their attachment capability and expression of adhesion molecules as well as the higher proportion of hepatic progenitor cells, neonatal hepatocytes may have an advantage over adult cells. Adult or neonatal hepatocytes were transplanted into Gunn rats, a model for Crigler-Najjar disease. Engraftment and repopulation were studied and compared by immunofluorescence (IF). Additionally, the serum bilirubin levels, the presence of bilirubin conjugates in rat serum, and the expression of uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1 family polypeptide A1 (UGT1A1) in rat liver samples were also analyzed. Here we show that neonatal HT results in long-term correction in Gunn rats. In comparison with adult cells, neonatal cells showed better engraftment and repopulation capability 3 days and 6 months after transplantation, respectively. Bilirubinemia decreased in the transplanted animals during the whole experimental follow-up (6 months). Bilirubin conjugates were also present in the serum of the transplanted animals. Western blots and IF confirmed the presence and expression of UGT1A1 in the liver. This work is the first to demonstrate the advantage of using neonatal hepatocytes for the treatment of Crigler-Najjar in vivo."

It is a persistent and tedious clinical disorder which is often resistant to conventional treatments.                                                                                   The aim of this study is to evaluate the main clinical signs, associated psychopathological disorders and outcome after antidepressant treatment of patients with vulvodynia.                                                                              Eighty patients were included. Clinical characteristics and psychopathological profiles were determined by appropriate instruments. The improvement of clinical symptoms after combined antidepressant drug therapy was also evaluated.                                                                              Pain (70%), burning (63.7%), dyspareunia (57.5%) and stinging (56.2%) were the most commonly reported symptoms. Most patients (56.5%) showed anxiety, and 52.2% of them were reported as having a depression disorder. When evaluated by psychometric tools, 81.4% of patients scored >   150 on the Life Event Scale, which means a risk >   50% of suffering an illness in the near future, and patients' scores in the Dermatology Life Quality Index showed higher values than the mean of the Spanish validation group. After 6 months of combined treatment with escitalopram (10-20 mg/day), perfenazine (2-4 mg/day) and amytriptiline (10 mg/day), a complete remission of the clinical symptoms was achieved in 41% of patients. In contrast, only 12% of patients who did not follow drug treatment reported a complete resolution of the clinical symptoms.                                                                                      Our results seem to confirm that vulvodynia is associated with psychiatric co-morbidity such as stress and depression. The study highlights that the psychiatric treatment may be a useful option to improve clinical symptoms. Whether these patients should be evaluated for depression or be referred to a psychiatrist, remains to be investigated."
8532075	"Glomerular hyperfiltration is emerging as the key risk factor for progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Podocytes are exposed to fluid flow shear stress (FFSS) caused by the flow of ultrafiltrate within Bowman's space. The mechanism of hyperfiltration-induced podocyte injury is not clear. We postulated that glomerular hyperfiltration in solitary kidney increases FFSS over podocytes.                                                                              Infant Sprague-Dawley rats at 5 days of age and C57BL/6J 14-week-old adult mice underwent unilateral nephrectomy. Micropuncture and morphological studies were then performed on 20- and 60-day-old rats. FFSS over podocytes in uninephrectomized rats and mice was calculated using the recently published equation by Friedrich et al. which includes the variables-single nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR), filtration fraction (f), glomerular tuft diameter (2RT) and width of Bowman's space (s).                                                                              Glomerular hypertrophy was observed in uninephrectomized rats and mice. Uninephrectomized rats on Day 20 showed a 2.0-fold increase in SNGFR, 1.0-fold increase in 2RT and 2.1-fold increase in FFSS, and on Day 60 showed a 1.9-fold increase in SNGFR, 1.3-fold increase in 2RT and 1.5-fold increase in FFSS, at all values of modeled 's'. Similarly, uninephrectomized mice showed a 2- to 3-fold increase in FFSS at all values of modeled SNGFR.                                                                                      FFSS over podocytes is increased in solitary kidneys in both infant rats and adult mice. This increase is a consequence of increased SNGFR. We speculate that increased FFSS caused by reduced nephron number contributes to podocyte injury and promotes the progression of CKD."
1988072	"Laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (LDN) involving kidneys with multiple arterial vessels is limited to a small number of reports, with all but two series reporting fewer than 25 patients. Moreover, outside of the pioneering centers at the University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins, no series of at least 25 patients has been published confirming these experience. The present study presents the largest series of LDN of donor kidneys with multiple arterial vessels outside of these two pioneering programs.                                                                              All LDN performed at the University of Cincinnati from 2000 to 2004 were reviewed. Results between LDN kidneys with a single vessel and those with multiple vessels were compared. Statistical analysis included chi-square and Student t test.                                                                              Of 240 LDN, 37 were performed for kidneys with multiple vessels (15%): nine right kidneys (25%) and 28 left kidneys (75%). Cold ischemia time was longer for the multiple vessel organs (46 +/- 24 minutes) than for single vessel organs (35 +/- 13 minutes; P = .001), and warm ischemia time was longer for the multiple vessel kidneys (4:20 +/- 2:05 minutes) than single vessel kidneys (3:13 +/- 0:47 minutes; P = .001). Recipient renal function (serum creatinine) was similar for multiple and single artery donors at postoperative day 7 (1.76 +/- 1.38 and 1.7 +/- 1.47) and at postoperative day 365 (1.06 +/- 0.3 and 1.34 +/- 0.44).

5076092	"A considerable proportion of liver transplantation recipients who receive hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) monotherapy for hepatitis B virus (HBV) prophylaxis develop resistance to HBIG. We retrospectively assessed the efficacy of HBV prophylaxis in 1524 patients who received primary high-dose HBIG monotherapy (n = 1463) or with a preemptive antiviral add-on as secondary combination therapy (n = 61). At a median follow-up time of 57 months, 106 (7.3%) patients receiving HBIG monotherapy experienced HBV recurrence, with a 10-year HBV recurrence rate of 9.8%, compared to none of the patients receiving preemptive combination therapy (P = 0.047). Thirteen patients (12.3%) with HBV recurrence failed antiviral therapy, leading to death or retransplantation. Response rates to rescue therapy before and after use of adefovir/entecavir were 44.4% and 91.8%, respectively. Acute exacerbation was not associated with treatment failure, but required prolonged treatment. Of 84 surviving patients with HBV recurrence, 44 (52.4%) showed no evidence of blood HBV DNA. The Gly145Arg mutation was found in 11 of 15 (73.3%) patients, whereas 25 of 71 (35.2%), 2 of 29 (6.9%), and 4 of 8 (50%) patients were resistant to lamivudine, adefovir, and entecavir, respectively. In conclusion, our finding of a 10-year HBV recurrence rate of 9.8% in patients receiving high-dose HBIG monotherapy indicates that this treatment is effective but requires complementary measures. Strict surveillance following HBIG monotherapy is necessary to enhance responses to rescue antiviral therapy. Preemptive conversion to combination therapy has a complementary role in prophylaxis with primary high-dose HBIG monotherapy, especially for patients at high risk of HBV recurrence."
7712147	"A neonate was noted to have two depressed scars on the upper part of the back at birth that we believe resulted from midtrimester amniocentesis; no underlying injury was apparent. Scar formation from needle puncture occurs in an estimated 1% to 3% of the infants whose mothers have undergone midtrimester diagnostic amniocentesis. The scars most commonly are depressed, dimplelike, and measure 1 to 2 mm in diameter, although linear scarring may also occur. Single or multiple scars may be present, and, in seven of the 36 infants previously described in the literature, internal injuries also occurred as a result of the needle puncture."
8642658	"Green tea catechins possess a wide range of pharmacological properties, including antiviral, anti-infective, and immunostimulatory properties. They also have demonstrated inhibitory effects on a variety of enzymatic and metabolic pathways involved in cancer development. Catechins have been shown to have antiproliferative properties in various cell lines and may have direct virucidal effect. The United States Food and Drug Administration has approved a topical ointment formulation of sinecatechins, derived from green tea catechins and other tea components, for the treatment of external genital and perianal warts. The exact mechanism of action of sinecatechins in eradication of human papillomavirus-induced external genital and perianal warts is unknown, but may be due to one or more of the mechanisms mentioned.                                                                                  This study was conducted to investigate the growth inhibitory potential of the sinecatechins in human cervical carcinoma cell lines infected with human papillomavirus.                                                                              The viability of tumor cell lines (CaSki and SiHa infected with human papillomavirus-16; HeLa and C4-I infected with human papillomavirus-18) was investigated as one parameter in a short-term viability assay (48 hours). This was followed by a long-term clonogenic assay (12-23 days) to determine the cytotoxic potential of sinecatechins as a parameter for cell viability and proliferation. This assay determined if the effect observed in the viability assay was due to retardation in cell proliferation or to a reduction of total cell number, leading to cell death.                                                                              Based on the data collected, sinecatechins inhibited cell growth in all four tumor cell lines by 50 percent (GI(50)) at concentrations ranging from 160 to 360µM. C4-I cells were the most sensitive to treatment with sinecatechins, with a lower GI(50) (~34µM). Total GI was achieved in a 48-hour assay at 625µM sinecatechins (40µM for C4-I), with growth inhibitory potential detectable after one hour. Clonogenic assays confirmed the cytotoxic potential of sinecatechins with a reduction in clone numbers in a concentration-dependent fashion. Sinecatechins substantially reduced the number of surviving HeLa cells at a concentration of 200µM, while surviving SiHa cells were almost totally eradicated with a concentration of 600µM.                                                                                     Sinecatechins demonstrated growth inhibitory potential in all four human papillomavirus-infected tumor cell lines, which may be attributed to the induction of apoptosis, mediated by cell cycle deregulation. In addition, this antiproliferative effect may contribute to the overall cancer-preventative function and possible direct antiviral activity of sinecatechins that may contribute to external genital and perianal warts clearance."
8314528	"Phytochrome-interacting factor 1 (PIF1) inhibits light-dependent seed germination. The specific function of PIF1 in seed germination is partly due to its high level of expression in imbibed seeds, but the associated regulatory factors have not been identified. Here we show that mutation of the early flowering in short days (EFS) gene, encoding an H3K4 and H3K36 methyltransferase, decreases the level of H3K36me2 and H3K36me3 but not H3K4me3 at the PIF1 locus, reduces the targeting of RNA polymerase II to the PIF1 locus, and reduces mRNA expression of PIF1 in imbibed seeds. Consistently, the efs mutant geminated even under the phyBoff condition, and had an expression profile of PIF1 target genes similar to that of the pif1 mutant. Introduction of an EFS transgene into the efs mutant restored the level of H3K36me2 and H3K36me3 at the PIF1 locus, the high-level expression of PIF1 mRNA, the expression pattern of PIF1 target genes, and the light-dependent germination of these seeds. Introduction of a PIF1 transgene into the efs mutant also restored the expression pattern of PIF1 target genes and light-dependent germination in imbibed seeds, but did not restore the flowering phenotype. Taken together, our results indicate that EFS is necessary for high-level expression of PIF1 mRNA in imbibed seeds."
8573518	"Sensory information provided by the periodontal mechanoreceptors (PMRs) is used by the nervous system to optimize the positioning of food, force levels, and force vectors involved in biting. The aim of this study was to describe motor performance during a novel manipulation-and-split task and to assess the extent to which control of this performance involves information from the PMRs.                                                                                            A total of 10 subjects with natural teeth, 10 with bimaxillary tooth-supported fixed prostheses (TSP) and 10 with bimaxillary implant-supported fixed prostheses (ISP) (61-83 [mean 69] years of age) were asked to perform an intraoral manipulation-and-split task that involved positioning a spherical chocolate dragée between the front teeth and then splitting it into two parts of equal size. The vertical jaw movement, sound of food cracking and masseter muscle activity were monitored during this task and the accuracy of the split was evaluated.                                                                              The group with natural teeth was significantly better than the other groups at splitting the candy with high precision. The jaw movements were similar between groups, but the contact phase prior to the split was significantly longer for those with natural dentition.                                                                                      The present findings support the conclusion that the nervous system collects rich information about contact between the teeth and food from the PMRs prior to powerful jaw action. Impairment (TSP) or absence (ISP) of this information alters motor behavior and impairs performance during the natural biting task employed here."
4656641	"The responses of the five cytosolic-type glutamine synthetase (GS1) genes of maize to treatment of hydroponically grown seedlings with 10 mM KNO3 or 10 mM NH4Cl were analyzed. Non-coding 3' gene-specific hybridization probes and radioanalytic imaging were used to quantitate individual gene transcript levels in excised roots and shoots before treatment and at selected times after treatment. Genes GS1-1 and GS1-2 exhibited distinct organ-specific responses to treatment with either nitrogen source. The GS1-1 transcript level increased over three-fold in roots, but changed little if any in shoots. In contrast, the GS1-2 transcript level increased over two-fold in shoots, but decreased in roots after treatment. Increased transcript levels were evident at 4 h after treatment with either nitrogen source, with maximum accumulations present at 8 h after treatment with ammonium and at 10-12 h after treatment with nitrate. The GS1-3 gene transcript level showed little or no change after treatment with either nitrogen source. The GS1-4 gene transcript level remained constant in shoots of treated seedlings, whereas in roots, it exhibited relatively minor, but complex responses to these two nitrogen sources. The GS1-5 gene transcript is present in very small amounts in seedlings, making it difficult to analyze its response to metabolites in young plants. These results provide support for the possibility that different cytosolic GS genes of maize play distinct roles in nitrogen metabolism during plant growth and differentiation."
7252927	"We sequenced and characterized PMP22 (22-kD peroxisomal membrane protein) from Arabidopsis, which shares 28% to 30% amino acid identity and 55% to 57% similarity to two related mammalian peroxisomal membrane proteins, PMP22 and Mpv17. Subcellular fractionation studies confirmed that the Arabidopsis PMP22 is a genuine peroxisomal membrane protein. Biochemical analyses established that the Arabidopsis PMP22 is an integral membrane protein that is completely embedded in the lipid bilayer. In vitro import assays demonstrated that the protein is inserted into the membrane posttranslationally in the absence of ATP, but that ATP stimulates the assembly into the native state. Arabidopsis PMP22 is expressed in all organs of the mature plant and in tissue-cultured cells. Expression of PMP22 is not associated with a specific peroxisome type, as it is detected in seeds and throughout postgerminative growth as cotyledon peroxisomes undergo conversion from glyoxysomes to leaf-type peroxisomes. Although PMP22 shows increased accumulation during the growth of young seedlings, its expression is not stimulated by light."
5179765	"In mammalian skin, stem cell factor (SCF) regulates the proliferation and maturation of mast cells and melanocytes, which are thought to be the only cutaneous cells that express the Kit-tyrosine kinase receptor (Kit) and respond to epithelial and mesenchymal-derived SCF. We previously had noted, however, the presence of Kit+ cells in murine hair follicles, in an introepithelial tissue compartment devoid of melanocytes and mast cells. Here we have identified the nature of this Kit+ population of cells in hair follicles of C57BL/6 mice. Anagen hair follicles showed strong Kit immunoreactivity not only in the pigmentary unit above the follicular dermal papilla but also in a much more proximally located, homogenous group of nondendritic, nonmelanized cells. By immunohistochemistry (desmoplakin+/Trp-1-) and electron microscopy (presence of tonofilaments, desmosomes, lack of melanosomes), these Kit+ cells were shown to be hair matrix keratinocytes and were also found in melanocyte-deficient hair follicles (Kit(Sl)/Kit(Sl-d) mice, Kit-neutralizing antibody-treated C57BL/6 mice). Expression of Kit and SCF was strongly hair-cycle-dependent, suggesting a functional role of epithelial Kit expression in hair growth control. This was supported by the observation that mice unable to respond to SCF stimulation (Kit(W)/Kit(W-v)) showed a significant retardation of anagen development compared to their wild-type littermates. The expression of Kit in the most rapidly proliferating compartment of the hair follicle epithelium suggests intriguing, as yet unexplored new functions of Kit signaling in epithelial cell biology."

9519371	"In this report we describe a unique case of tinea pedis. A 29-year-old man presented with a 3-day history of asymptomatic purpuric papules predominantly on his left foot. Potassium hydroxide preparation demonstrated fungal hyphae and culture yielded Trichophyton mentagrophytes. This patient presented unusually with purpuric papules, unlike the three commonly described types of tinea pedis. Given the morphology, positive potassium hydroxide slide preparation, T. mentagrophytes on fungal culture and clinical response to ketoconazole cream, we conclude that this represents a unique variant of tinea pedis. We recognize that even common dermatological diagnoses can have unique presentations, and it is important for clinicians to maintain a broad differential for new dermatologic cases."
2382602	"Fourteen commercial samples of the popular Brazilian aphrodisiac Catuaba specified as bark drugs of Anemopaegma, Erythroxylum and Trichilia species were examined for identity and purity. Only a minority of the examined Catuaba samples contained the crude drugs claimed on the labels. More than half of the products were adulterated with different crude drugs. The majority of the samples contained a bark originating from Trichilia catigua. The TLC fingerprints confirmed the heterogeneity, in 50% of the samples tropane alkaloids of various concentrations were detected. TLC and HPLC methods for separation and identification of the tropane alkaloids were developed and their analytical data (RF values, retention times, ESI-MS) given. The structure elucidation of the two main alkaloids, catuabine D and its hydroxymethyl derivative, is presented. The 1H- and 13C-NMR assignments of these alkaloids are discussed with regard to literature data. Neither aqueous nor methanolic extracts of the Trichilia catigua reference material nor alkaloid-enriched fractions of commercial samples showed any effect on the rabbit corpus cavernosum in an in vitro test."
4368829	Three isoenzymes of superoxide dismutase were identified in germinating seeds of Pennisetum typhoideum. Isoenzyme-I was localized in chloroplasts and isoenzyme-II was found to be associated with mitochondria. By using inhibitors isoenzyme-I and III were tentatively identified as Cu-Zn superoxide dismutases and isoenzyme-II as a Mn-containing enzyme.
6131552	"Ammonium assimilation during the initial stages of Scots pine growth involves two cytosolic glutamine synthetase (GS, EC: 6.3.1.2) isoenzymes encoded by separate genes, GS1a and GS1b. GS1a was most exclusively expressed in photosynthetic tissues of the seedling whereas GS1b was expressed ubiquitously showing higher levels in non-photosynthetic tissues such as root and hypocotyl. Temporal expression analysis has shown that when germination starts GS1b is the predominant form in the embryo, however, its relative abundance in the tissue decreased in the postgerminative stages when green cotyledons are developed. In contrast GS1a was present at a low level in the embryo but its abundance increased markedly during germination and seedling growth. These data suggest that GS1a and GS1b genes display different and non-redundant roles in the nitrogen metabolism of conifers. The precise localization of individual transcripts by in situ hybridization strongly supports this possibility. GS1 gene products are mainly expressed in different cellular types: GS1a in chlorophylic parenchyma and GS1b in the vascular bundles of all tissues examined in the seedling. Our data support that glutamine biosynthesis in pine seedlings follows a different pattern related to angiosperms involving two cytosolic GS proteins: one of them a typical cytosolic GS which may be involved in the generation of glutamine for N transport and a second cytosolic GS generating amino donors for the biosynthesis of major N compounds in photosynthetic tissues, a closer role to angiosperm chloroplastic GS. The results are discussed with regard to recent studies on N mobilization and metabolism during the initial stages of conifer development."
3707639	"Suppression of apoptosis is one of the pathogenetic mechanisms for psoriasis vulgaris (PV). Survivin has the function of regulating cell division and inhibiting apoptosis. Patients with PV have an increased resistance to cutaneous infections. Human β-defensin-3 (hBD-3) is a kind of antimicrobial peptide with antimicrobial activities. To assess and compare the transcript levels of survivin and hBD-3 in pairwise skin from PV.                                                         &                                    A total of 20 patients, 10 with mild PV and 10 with severe PV, and 10 healthy control donors were recruited in the study. Real-time PCR was conducted to determine survivin and hBD-3 mRNA expression in skin lesions and normal-appearing skin of PV patients, and normal skin of healthy controls.                                                                              Compared with normal control skin, the survivin mRNA expression of normal-appearing skin in the mild PV group, lesions of the mild PV group and the severe PV group were significantly elevated (P<   0.05). hBD-3 mRNA expression was statistically increased in both normal-appearing skin and in lesions in mild and severe PV groups, in contrast to normal skin (P<   0.001). Significant differences of hBD-3 mRNA were also found between lesions and non-lesional skin in the mild PV group and severe PV group (P<   0.05). Survivin mRNA levels were mildly correlated with hBD-3 mRNA levels (rs = 0.398; P<   0.05) in skin lesions from 20 PV patients.

This study included 20 nonsegmental vitiligo cases. They were epithelial grafted, success was maintained with the use of UV sessions for a year, and further follow-up was allowed until new phases of activity developed.

The permanency of epithelial grafts in spite of disease reactivity is a good sign and magnifies the value of surgical approaches in management of vitiligo. New genetically different melanocytes should have been provided and were able to resist the new immune attacks in spite of the yielding of other skin melanocytes."

A prequestionnaire was drawn after selecting items from a verbatim transcript. It was then subjected to a cognitive debriefing. During the validation step, this questionnaire was sent to patients with the Dermatology Life Quality Index, Short Form-12 health-related questionnaire, and severity scores (global severity: mild/moderate/severe/very severe; clinical severity evaluated by 6 visual analog scales). A shortened version of the questionnaire was designed. The validity of the tool was confirmed: for its structure and 1-dimensional nature (Cronbach α), convergent (Spearman correlation) and discriminating (Tukey test) validity; α risk was fixed at 5%.                                                                              The initial questionnaire included 60 items. During the validation phase, 59 subjects were tested. The shortened version included 32 items (IQoL-32) and 7 dimensions (Cronbach α: 0.94). The higher the score, the more impacted the QoL. IQoL-32 was positively correlated to Dermatology Life Quality Index (P <    .0001) and negatively to Short Form-12 health-related questionnaire (P <    .0001). IQoL-32 was highly correlated to clinical severity: overall analysis (Spearman ranking: 0.72; P <    .0001) or analysis per dimension (highest correlations: discomfort, pain, interpersonal relations). IQoL-32 demonstrated a higher correlation with visual analog scale compared with Dermatology Life Quality Index and Short Form-12 health-related questionnaire. It also showed a good discriminating power (P <    .0001) according to overall severity levels.

3053452	"The association between hospital capacity and survival after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) was examined using the dataset accumulated by the Japan Society of Hematopoietic Cell Transplantations (JSHCT). The subjects were 3134 patients who received first allo-BMTs between 1991 and 1997 reported to the JSHCT. They were divided into three groups by cumulative hospital experience of allo-BMTs: low volume (capacity) (LV; <    or = 25 cases), moderate volume (capacity) (MV; 26-75 cases) and high volume (capacity) (HV; >    or = 76 cases). Using a proportional hazards model, the association of hospital experience with early survival at day 100 (D100S), and overall survival (OS) were examined. For leukemia patients, leukemia-free survival (LFS) was also analyzed. When HV was defined as the reference group, the hazard ratios (HRs) of OS for all subjects were 1.10 (95% confidence interval; 0.97-1.25) for MV and 1.25 for LV (1.08-1.44). The HRs with D100S were 1.20 (0.96-1.51) for MV and 1.40 (1.08-1.80) for LV. Larger values were observed for OS and D100S in cases of leukemia. Survival after BMT from sibling donors was clearly influenced by hospital experience, but this was not the case from unrelated donors. These findings suggest that size of the transplant team should be considered in order to improve the outcome of sibling BMT in general."
8567820	Administration of donor bone marrow (BM) cells can improve the outcome of transplantation. The ability of donor vascularized bone marrow transplantation (VBM) to provide an ongoing source of donor cells and improve survival in a rigorous rat model of hind limb transplantation (HLTX) was investigated. HLTX were performed between Brown Norway (BN) donors and Lewis recipients in three groups: HLTX; HLTX plus intravenous donor BM cells and HLTX plus simultaneous VBM transplantation. Animals received 12 weeks triple immunosuppression. Survival was compared at 4 months and donor chimerism was evaluated. Simultaneous VBM transplantation led to slight but nonsignificant prolongation of survival (P=0.056). Donor cells in the VBM were eventually replaced by recipient and there was no long-term increase in chimerism. Few donor cells were observed in thymus. Simultaneous VBM transplantation showed a trend for improved survival of HLTX however the VBM failed to provide a sustained increase in chimerism.

While the number of HBsAg carrier patients with dermatological disorders was 62 (70.75%), it was only 24 (28.57%) in control patients. This seems statistically important: Yates' corrected chi-square test = 28.5; P = 0.0000001; odds ratio = 6.0 (2.94 <    odds ratio <    12.2). The prevalence of oral lichen planus and pitted keratolysis in HBsAg carrier group was significantly higher than that of controls. We found the duration of positivity was not important statistically in the development of the dermatological disorders.

High-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is increasingly used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases and it has been reported that it may also be effective in PV.                                                                                   To evaluate prospectively the efficacy of IVIg for PV using an 'n-of-1' placebo-controlled trial.                                                                              A randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of IVIg was conducted in a single patient with severe PV, comprising two phases of six consecutive months of either IVIg or placebo infusion. Before the commencement of the trial, the patient had received 18 months of IVIg but concerns about the continuing therapeutic efficacy of IVIg led to the double-blind placebo-controlled 'n-of-1' trial of IVIg.                                                                              Pemphigus autoantibody titres were significantly higher when on placebo compared with IVIg treatment (median 1 : 80 vs. 1 : 20, P = 0.007), desmoglein 3 (126 vs. 79, P = 0.004) and desmoglein 1 antibody levels (126 vs. 94, P = 0.004). There was a significant improvement in subjective disease activity scores while on IVIg compared with placebo (mean overall score 11.6 vs. 20.6, P <    0.0001).                                                                                      The results of this study confirm a beneficial effect of IVIg in the management of refractory PV."
8730462	"We report the long-term results of a prospective randomized study on the use of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) for prevention of hepatic complications after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Two hundred forty-two patients, 232 with malignant disease, were randomized to receive (n = 123) or not to receive (n = 119) UDCA from the beginning of the conditioning until 90 days post-transplantation. The results were reported after 1-year follow-up. UDCA administration reduced significantly the proportion of patients developing high serum bilirubin levels as well as the incidence of severe acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), liver GVHD, and intestinal GVHD. In the UDCA prophylaxis group, nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was lower and overall survival better than in the control group. After a 10-year follow-up, the difference in the survival and NRM in favor of the UDCA-treated group, seen at 1 year, was maintained (survival 48% versus 38%, P = .037; NRM 28% versus 41%, P = .01). A landmark analysis in patients surviving at 1 year post-transplantation showed no significant differences between the study groups in the long-term follow-up in chronic GVHD, relapse rate, NRM, disease-free survival, or overall survival. These long-term results continue to support the useful role of UDCA in the prevention of transplant-related complications in allogeneic transplantation."
2436596	"To assess the impact of homeostatic expansion on the occurrence of acute GVHD after reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) transplantation, systemic levels of IL-7 and IL-15 and expression of their specific receptor chains were prospectively investigated in 45 fully HLA-matched allograft recipients. IL-7 and IL-15 levels peaked at four- to fivefold over pre-conditioning values. IL-7 levels were inversely correlated to absolute T-cell counts. Peak IL-15 levels positively correlated to concurrent CRP levels, but normalized earlier than IL-7. These results indicate that the kinetic course of IL-7 depends mainly on initiation of T-cell recovery, while IL-15 depends more on peri-transplant inflammation after RIC. Longer duration of the rise in IL-7 levels was associated with preservation of a normal CD4/CD8 ratio. In all, 16 (35%) patients developed grade 2-4 acute GVHD at a median of 42 days post graft, preceded by higher IL-7 levels and more downregulation of IL-7 receptor α chain on CD4(+) T cells than in patients without acute GVHD, suggesting enhanced homeostatic expansion. In multivariate analysis, IL-7 level measured on day +30 was the foremost predictive factor for grade 2-4 acute GVHD (P=0.002). Measurement of IL-7 level after RIC transplantation might help predict risk of subsequent acute GvHD."
3491171	"Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is generally used to treat systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in Western countries. However, chloroquine retinopathy became a problem in Japan, and chloroquine has never been used since then. Even now HCQ remains non-approved. Therefore, the Japanese Hydroxychloroquine Study Group has been organized, and activities have started to have HCQ approved within Japan. In the present study, we investigated the effectiveness of HCQ against the skin manifestations of lupus erythematosus. There were seven patients, all female, and they consisted of four patients with SLE (skin lesion type: discoid lupus erythematosus [DLE] in three, subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus in one and lupus erythematosus profundus in one), two patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus (both DLE), and one patient with a combination of SLE and dermatomyositis. HCQ was effective in three patients and ineffective in the two patients. We could not judge the efficacy of HCQ in the other two patients. There were no adverse effects in any of the patients. Efficacy was exhibited against telangiectasia and erythema. HCQ is also an effective and safe treatment for Japanese patients, and it is hoped that it will be approved for use in Japan very soon."
9653870	"Hair loss is common in patients with HIV-1 infection, and in black patients this loss may be associated with straightening. Possible causes are frequently present in patients with HIV-1. These causes include chronic HIV-1 infection itself and recurrent secondary infections, nutritional deficiencies, immunologic and endocrine dysregulation, and exposure to multiple drugs. However, histopathologic features have rarely been reported in these patients.                                                                                  The objective was to evaluate the changes in the hairs of a group of these patients and to identify the light microscopic and ultrastructural changes in the hairs and the histologic changes in the scalp.                                                                              Hair plucks and pulls with scanning electron microscopy of the hairs were done on 10 patients with late-stage HIV-1 infection. In addition, scalp biopsy specimens were examined in both vertical and transverse sections.                                                                              All patients had telogen effluvium. Numerous apoptotic or necrotic keratinocytes were seen in the upper external root sheath follicular epithelium in addition to a mild to moderate perifollicular mononuclear cell infiltrate often containing eosinophils. Variable dystrophy of the hair shafts was also a consistent feature.                                                                                     Although telogen effluvium is a common response to a wide spectrum of biologic stresses, the presence of apoptotic or necrotic keratinocytes within the upper end of the external root sheath epithelium and dystrophy of hairs may be markers of hair loss in patients with HIV-1 infection."
4197007	"Several GSTs have been characterised in maize. GST I is a homodimer of 29 kDa subunits, GST II a hetrodimer of 27 kDa and 29 kDa subunits and GST IV a homodimer of 27 kDa subunits. We report the isolation and characterization of a herbicide-safener inducible cDNA clone, GST-27. Based on partial amino acid sequence, GST-27 encodes the 27 kDa subunit present in both glutathione S-transferase isoforms GST II and IV. Northern blotting was used to compare the expression patterns of GST-27 with that of GST-29. Transcripts corresponding to GST-27 were found to be constitutively expressed in RNA isolated from the root, but no expression was detected in RNA isolated from aerial parts of the plant. The application of herbicide safener caused a dramatic increase in the expression of GST-27 in all aerial plant parts tested. GST-29 was found to be constitutively expressed in RNA isolated from a number of maize tissues. The basal level of GST-29 expression showed a minimal increase upon herbicide safener treatment. Although a range of hormonal, environmental and physiological stimuli failed to elevate GST-27 levels, some increase in GST-27 mRNA was observed in the late stages of leaf senescence and after treatments resulting in phytotoxic effects."
6982535	"A 19-year-old girl presented with hemorrhagic acneiform lesions on the face for several months that was unresponsive to conventional acne treatment. A biopsy revealed a noninfectious suppurative granulomatous dermatitis with hemorrhage, possibly representing a ruptured folliculitis. A second biopsy revealed chronic granulomatous dermal inflammation and hemorrhage with foreign body giant cells non-infectious by stains. No vasculitis was noted in either biopsy. Later in her course she developed a severe sinusitis and eventually presented with severe fevers, rapid weight loss, sinusitis, and cough. Further workup produced the diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's granulomatosis). She rapidly improved with intravenous steroids and rituximab. To date, acneiform lesions have only been reported in young adult patients and may represent a clinical manifestation of granulomatosis with polyangiitis unique to this age group, as illustrated in our patient."
7596527	"The optimal balance between maximizing the number versus the outcome of transplantation utilizing kidneys from small (≤20 kg) pediatric donors remains unclear, complicated by the choice of single versus en bloc transplantation with their attendant technical risks. Using the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) database, we examined kidney recovery and utilization patterns, and 1-year transplant outcomes by single kilogram weight strata. Between January 1, 2005 and June 30, 2010, 2352 kidneys from ≤20 kg donors were transplanted into 1531 recipients, 710 single kidney transplants (SKTs) and 821 en bloc kidney transplants (EBKTs). Increased donor weight was associated with higher rates of recovery, transplantation and SKT. Low donor weight (linear p <    0.001; quadratic p = 0.003), SKT versus EBKT (p = 0.008), increased cold ischemia time (p = 0.003), local versus nonlocal donor (p = 0.0044), low versus high volume center (p = 0.003) and the interaction term between center volume and donor weight (p = 0.0024) were associated with graft failure. Notably, lower donor weight exacerbated the negative impact of low center volume but did not worsen the negative impact of SKT on outcomes. Our data show that EBKT offers superior 1-year survival at the expense of accomplishing one rather than two transplants. However, SKTs yield excellent outcomes when performed at experienced centers."
5480693	"TIM-3 is expressed on primary T effector cells, including th1, ctl, and Th17, which play essential roles in acute allograft rejection (AR). In this study we monitored sequential changes of TIM-3 gene expression among peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) from renal transplant recipients.                                                                              The study consisted of an AR group (n=24), a no AR group (n=20), and a stable group (n=18). Prospective serial blood samples were collected after allotransplantation and during AR episodes. The mRNA encoding for TIM-3 was quantified using real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Statistical analyses were performed to correlate gene transcript measurements with clinical events.                                                                              TIM-3 mRNA in PBL showed significantly higher expression in the AR compared with the no AR and stable groups: 286.72±86.28 vs 126.10±28.31 vs 96.91±17.88, respectively (P=.00). The receiver operating characteristic curve showed a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 87.5% for the utility of TIM-3 for rejection diagnosis. Antirejection therapy decreased TIM-3 mRNA expression in all AR patients. There was a positive correlation between TIM-3 mRNA expression and serum creatinine (r2=0.716; P=.00).                                                                                      TIM-3 mRNA quantification by RT-PCR in PBL may be a promising tool for a noninvasive diagnosis of AR. But the utility for predicting the prognosis of AR after antirejection treatment was limited, owing to the great variations of TIM-3 mRNA expression during AR episodes."
8279450	"There is no definite cure for vitiligo; however, treatment responses with photobiological modalities are quite acceptable. Of all these, narrow-band UVB phototherapy was proposed rather recently. Calcipotriol has been shown to have stimulating activity on melanogenesis besides immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. This study was performed to determine whether adding topical calcipotriol to narrow-band UVB phototherapy enhances the efficacy of treatment.                                                                              In this prospective, single-blinded (investigator), right-left comparison clinical study, 20 patients with generalized vitiligo were enrolled. Symmetrical lesions with similar sizes, bilaterally distributed on arms, legs, hands, feet or trunk were selected as reference lesions. In addition to narrow-band UVB, totally 96 treatment sessions, received two or three times weekly, the patients were asked to apply 0.005% topical calcipotriol on the selected side of the reference lesions twice daily. Then, they were monitored at the end of every 24-session interval.                                                                              Cosmetically acceptable repigmentation was observed in 55% (11/20) of the patients without taking calcipotriol into account. There was statistically significant better response on the side that calcipotriol was not applied at the 24th session (P <    0.05). No statistically significant difference was found between the calcipotriol-treated and non-treated sides at 48th, 72th, and 96th sessions (P >    0.05).                                                                                     Our data confirm that, narrow-band UVB phototherapy is effective by itself in vitiligo, and show that adding topical calcipotriol does not improve treatment outcome."

All the workers were subjected to clinical examination after collection of information regarding demographic characteristics, occupational characteristics and clinical history on a predesigned proforma. Of them, 47.8% had morbid skin conditions. Frictional callosities in palm were observed in 18 (19.6%) subjects while 4 (4.3%) subjects had contact dermatitis. Other conditions included dry, fissured and scaly skin, infectious skin lesion, tinea cruris, lesion and ulcers on hands and/or soles.                                                                                     The skin conditions were common in the age group of 20-25 years, males, those having ≥1 year exposure and those working for longer hours. Half of the workers not using personal protective equipment had reported skin-related symptoms."
2035489	"Earlier investigations were continued on cell specific effects of eight different extra chromosomes in single trisomic sugar beets (Beta vulgaris L.). The degree of endopolyploidy, which was determined approximately by means of chloroplast numbers per cell, was changed by the presence of certain extra chromosomes: it either increased (I, II, VIII) or decreased (III through VII), but in epidermis and in spongy parenchyma the change was in the same direction. Sometimes, however, the degree was found to increase in spongy parenchyma alone or to decrease in epidermis alone; this evidence is consistent with the generally low liability of the epidermis to endopolyploidization. Independently of endopolyploidy the basic number of plastids (i.e., the amount reached in a cell type under given conditions, but without endopolyploidy) was altered in certain trisomes: it was higher (with extra chromosomes III through VI) or lower (II, perhaps also I) than in eudiploid control plants, the change taking the same direction in epidermal and in spongy parenchyma cells as in guard cells."
7316179	"Progressive osseous heteroplasia (OMIM 166350) is a rare autosomal dominant condition that presents in childhood as dermal ossification and may progress deeper to involve subcutaneous fat and connective tissue. Recently, paternally inherited inactivating mutations in the GNAS1 gene on chromosome 20q13 have been implicated in the pathogenesis, although sporadic cases have also been reported. We report a 9-year-old British Chinese girl with progressive osseous heteroplasia resulting from a de novo missense mutation (W281R) in the GNAS1 gene. She is of small stature (0.4th centile) and started to develop skin lesions at the age of 9 months. These have been confirmed histologically as osteoma cutis. She is of normal intelligence and development and has no dysmorphic features. The GNAS1 gene exhibits imprinting and maternally inherited mutations have previously been shown to result in Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy (OMIM 103580) with pseudohypothyroidism type 1a, whereas paternally inherited mutations result in progressive osseous heteroplasia or the Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy phenotype with pseudopseudohypothyroidism (OMIM 300800). With only nine mutations of the GNAS1 gene reported so far in progressive osseous heteroplasia, this new mutation helps to extend further the genotype-phenotype correlation."

6851625	"The skin is a target organ and source for proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-derived peptides, such as alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), which acts by binding to melanocortin receptors (MC-Rs). Recent progress in our understanding of the cutaneous POMC system has demonstrated that human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) are a novel target for alpha-MSH. MC-1R is expressed by HDFs in vitro and in situ. MC-1R expression is also detectable in human connective tissue sheath fibroblasts (CTSFs) and in dermal papilla cells (DPCs) of the hair follicle, the latter concomitantly expressing MC-1R and MC-4R in vitro and in situ. Both HDFs and DPCs are capable of generating POMC-derived peptides, although cell-specific differences exist in the expression of prohormone convertases and the amounts of POMC-derived peptides generated. Functional studies have shown that alpha-MSH exerts anti-inflammatory actions in human fibroblastic skin cells by suppressing interleukin-1 (IL-1)-induced IL-8 production, activation of the transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1) and induction of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 by interferon-alpha. In addition, alpha-MSH antagonizes the effect of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) on collagen synthesis in HDFs in vitro and exerts antifibrogenic activity in a mouse model of cutaneous fibrosis. These findings indicate that fibroblastic cells participate in the cutaneous POMC system in which alpha-MSH appears to act as a modulator of inflammatory and fibrogenic responses. The biological activities of alpha-MSH in fibroblastic cells of the skin point towards novel clues in our understanding of the pathophysiology of fibrotic skin disorders and inflammatory diseases of the hair follicle and, finally, suggest innovative therapeutic options for the treatment of these conditions."
9210402	"Using a fruit-specific cDNA as a probe we isolated and sequenced the two corresponding homologous genes (Sn-1 and Sn-2) of the bell pepper (Capsicum annuum) genome. Both genes have a single intron and numerous unusual long inverted repeat sequences. The introns share 87% homology and Sn-2 contains one 450 bp additional sequence with structural features of a transposable element, which is highly repetitive in the bell pepper genome. Surprisingly, analysis in data banks showed that genes encoding the potato starch phosphorylase (EC 2.4.1.1) and patatin contain a similar element, named Alien, in their 5'-upstream region. Alien elements are characterized by a conserved 28 bp terminal inverted repeat (TIR), small size, high AT content, potential to form stable DNA secondary structures and they have probably been inserted in TA target sites. Interestingly, the TIR of the Alien elements shares high homology with sequences existing in the TIR of extrachromosomal linear pSKL DNA plasmid of Saccharomyces kluyveri. Northern blot analyses detected Sn-1 transcripts principally in the red fruit whereas no Sn-2 transcripts were detected in neither of the samples monitored. Western blot analyses detected a 16.8 kDa Sn protein principally in the ripe red fruit and wounded areas of green unripe fruit. A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of Sn-1 with protein sequences in data banks revealed a significant homology with proteins likely involved in the plant's disease resistance response. Analyses at the subcellular level showed that Sn-1 is localized in the membrane of vacuoles."
4235469	"Analysis of data of 6298 patients with cutaneous melanoma seen at the Department of Dermatology and Allergology at the Ludwig-Maximilians University of Munich between 1977 and 1998 identified 31 patients who first experienced metastatic disease 10 or more years after surgical treatment of the primary melanoma. The mean tumor thickness in patients with late progression of disease was 1.4 mm. There was no sex predominance. Of 31 patients, 15 (48. 3%) were female and included both premenopausal and postmenopausal women at the time of initial diagnosis without any predominance. Sixteen of the 31 patients (51.6%) with late onset of progression had primary tumors located on the trunk. The prognosis after relapse was related to the site of recurrence; survival after local or regional node recurrence was often prolonged, whereas survival after distant metastases usually was limited. Survival after late recurrence did not correlate with disease-free survival. A high-risk group for late recurrence could not be identified. The data emphasize the value of continued clinical follow-up and self-examination for early detection of regional recurrences. We advocate a lifelong follow-up, also to identify other melanocytic lesions at risk (eg, dysplastic nevi, secondary or multiple melanomas)."
5669815	"Plant steroid hormones, brassinosteroids (BRs), play essential roles in modulating cell elongation, vascular differentiation, senescence and stress responses. BRs signal through plasma membrane-localized receptor and other components to modulate the BES1/BZR1 (BRI1-EMS SUPPRESSOR 1/BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT 1) family of transcription factors that modulate thousands of target genes. Arabodopsis thaliana homeodomain-leucine zipper protein 1 (HAT1), which encodes a homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip) class II transcription factor, was identified through chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments as a direct target gene of BES1. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutants of HAT1 display altered BR responses. HAT1 and its close homolog HAT3 act redundantly, as the double mutant hat1 hat3 displayed a reduced BR response that is stronger than the single mutants alone. Moreover, hat1 hat3 enhanced the phenotype of a weak allele of the BR receptor mutant bri1 and suppressed the phenotype of constitutive BR response mutant bes1-D. These results suggest that HAT1 and HAT3 function to activate BR-mediated growth. Expression levels of several BR-repressed genes are increased in hat1 hat3 and reduced in HAT1OX, suggesting that HAT1 functions to repress the expression of a subset of BR target genes. HAT1 and BES1 bind to a conserved homeodomain binding (HB) site and BR response element (BRRE) respectively, in the promoters of some BR-repressed genes. BES1 and HAT1 interact with each other and cooperate to inhibit BR-repressed gene expression. Furthermore, HAT1 can be phosphorylated and stabilized by GSK3 (GLYCOGEN SYNTHASE KINASE 3)-like kinase BIN2 (BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE 2), a well established negative regulator of the BR pathway. Our results thus revealed a previously unknown mechanism by which BR signaling modulates BR-repressed gene expression and coordinates plant growth."

This procedure was performed in 3 patients without biliary complications. No complications associated with the external drainage tube occurred. Here we report the techniques and results for this new procedure."
2439303	"The prokaryotic signalling molecules (p)ppGpp, also called ""magic spots"", regulate a wide variety of physiological activities in bacteria, including transcription, translation, and replication as well as some enzymatic activities such as those of some GTP-binding proteins, which are necessary for bacterial cells to adapt their physiology to different environmental stimuli. This response is called the stringent response. Recently, (p)ppGpp molecules and (p)ppGpp synthetase homologues, designated RSHs, have been identified in plants. At least some of the RSHs are targeted to chloroplasts. A knockdown mutation in one of the RSHs results in unusual flower development in Arabidopsis, suggesting that the plastid stringent response has important roles in the physiology of higher plants. Possible (p)ppGpp target proteins are investigated."

We have reviewed the literature and found 50 cases, of which only 40 had common features reminiscent of the original description of Kaposi. These 'authentic' cases of keratosis lichenoides chronica (KLC) showed strong clinical and histological similarity, a uniformity indicating that KLC is an entity and is distinct from lichen planus. KLC may be associated with internal diseases such as glomerulonephritis and lymphoproliferative disorders."
5127102	"Renal involvement determines the prognosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The aims of this study were to assess the clinical, laboratory and therapeutic aspects of lupus nephritis (LN) in Senegal in order to improve its management. We included all patients presenting with SLE followed-up in the Internal Medicine and Dermatology Clinics of the Aristide Le Dantec University Teaching Hospital of Dakar, from January 1993 to December 2002. Patients with SLE without evidence of LN (defined by proteinuria more than 0.5 g/24 hours and/or hematuria) were excluded. A total of 74 patients with a diagnosis of SLE were studied, 42 of whom (56.75%) had features of LN. Their mean age was 29.6 years and male-female ratio was 0.13. The nephrotic syndrome was seen in 45.23% of the cases and renal insufficiency in 37.71%. Renal biopsy was performed in 52.38% of the cases, which showed predominantly WHO classes IV and V lesions. The main treatment modality employed was corticosteroids, while immunosuppressive drugs in addition were used in 35.71% of the patients. The short-term prognosis was favorable but in the middle-term, many patients were lost to follow-up. We conclude that early diagnosis by systematic urine screening, good patient information, percutaneous renal biopsy and use of appropriate immunosuppressive therapy will help improving the prognosis of LN in Senegal."
3147447	"Cyclosporine (CsA) is a widely used immunosuppressive agent in kidney transplant patients. In Brazil, around 30% of patients awaiting kidney transplantation carry anti-HCV antibodies. Previous observations suggest altered CsA pharmacokinetics in these patients.                                                                              We conducted two pharmacokinetic studies. In the pre-transplant (pre-Tx) study, we examined 22 dialysis patients on chronic hemodialysis awaiting transplantation, 11 anti-HCV+ [seven polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive] matched against 11 controls. In the post-transplant (post-Tx) study, we enrolled 24 kidney allograft recipients - 10 anti-HCV+ (six PCR-positive), and 14 controls. In the first study, all patients received an 8-mg/kg dose of CsA microemulsion (ME). Secondly, the dosage was indicated by the patient's medical team. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from 13 blood samples (0-12 h postdose) by fluorescence polarization immunoassay with specific monoclonal antibodies.                                                                              In both studies, maximum concentration (C(max)), minimum concentration (C(min)) and area under the CsA time-concentration curve from 0 to 12 h (AUC(0-12)) were higher for anti-HCV+ patients than for controls, but significantly so only for AUC(0-12) in the pre-Tx study (42%; p <    0.05). When PCR-positive patients were compared with controls, differences were amplified. In the pre-Tx study, differences were 58%, 69%, and 91% higher in PCR-positive patients for C(max) (p = 0.05), AUC(0-12) (p <    0.01), and C(min) (p <    0.01), respectively. In the post-Tx study, results were 50% (p <    0.01) and 32% (p <    0.01) higher in PCR-positive patients for C(max) and AUC(0-12), respectively. In the pre-Tx study, the impact of viremia was significantly higher in female patients. CsA trough levels remained higher along the first year post-transplantation in viremic patients.                                                                                      Anti-HCV+ patients, especially those with viremia, present altered CsA pharmacokinetics, with higher peak levels and drug exposure than controls."
5368771	"A characteristic pattern of hemodynamic changes that may occur in reperfusion phase of liver transplantation (LT) is known as post-reperfusion syndrome (PRS). In this study, we determined the frequency of PRS and evaluated possible predictors of PRS. The medical records of 152 patients who underwent living donor LT were reviewed. PRS was defined as a decrease in mean arterial pressure of more than 30% from the baseline value for more than one min during the first five min after reperfusion. The frequency of PRS was determined, and patients were divided into two groups: PRS group and non-PRS group. Donor factors, preoperative and intraoperative recipient factors, and postoperative outcomes were compared between the two groups. PRS occurred in 58 recipients (34.2%). Preoperative model for end-stage liver disease scores of recipients and percentage of graft steatotic changes were higher in PRS group. PRS group showed higher heart rates and lower hemoglobin values preoperatively. Before reperfusion, PRS group received more transfusion and their urine output was less than that of non-PRS group. Postoperatively, peak bilirubin during the first five d after LT was higher in PRS group. In conclusion, both severity of liver disease and graft steatosis may increase risk for PRS in LT. Further prospective studies of PRS in its relationship to outcome are indicated."
1782462	"Botulinum toxins are currently used to reduce facial muscle activity, and hyaluronic acid is used to correct volume loss. This study evaluates the combination of abobotulinumtoxinA (Dysport) and hyaluronic acid 20 mg/mL (Perlane) for rejuvenating specific areas of the upper face. Subjects (n = 20) with mild to moderate temporal volume loss as well as glabellar and/or periorbital rhytids were enrolled in this single-center, open-label, nonrandomized pilot study. Subjects were randomly assigned a number and treated with hyaluronic acid, divided between temporal and glabellar region, and abobotulinumtoxinA in the periorbital and glabellar region. A 1-month touch-up was given if needed. Subjects were evaluated by the investigator, and each subject completed a questionnaire at baseline and at 3, 6, and 9 months after treatment. For glabellar lines and crow's feet, median grades decreased from baseline at 1 month and at 3 months, but returned to baseline values at 6 months. For temporal assessments, the median grade decreased from baseline at 1, 3, and 6 months and returned to baseline at 9 months. Similar trends were observed in subjects' perceived age, perceived social and professional limitations, and desire to alter their facial appearance. Among subjects previously treated with botulinum toxin alone, 64% rated the combination treatment said ""superior."" Adverse effects were mild and transient. The combination of abobotulinumtoxinA and hyaluronic acid appears to rejuvenate the periorbital, temporal, glabellar, and crow's feet areas with minimal adverse effects."
3311268	Patients with large congenital melanocytic nevus (LCMN) have a high risk of developing malignant melanoma (MM) and other malignancies. We report a case of a mesenchymal malignancy that best fit the diagnosis of a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor and subsequent development of a MM developing from a LCMN. There are no previous reports of a second primary malignant neoplasm arising from a LCMN.
5972425	"Mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) responses of spleen cells from mice bearing tumors induced by murine sarcoma virus of the Moloney type (MSV) against allogeneic spleen cells were found to be markedly depressed, as estimated by three parameters: lymphoblast counts, 3H-thymidine incorporation (TI), and cell-mediated lysis (CML). While all three parameters were definitely depressed in comparison to the normal controls, TI was depressed to a greater degree than lymphoblast counts and CML. MSV spleen cells also had a suppressive effect on the MLC responses of normal spleen cells in third party type of experiments. The cells mediating this effect were radioresistant non-T cells, which were removed by adherence columns and were inactivated by carrageenan. These data suggested that the supressor cells were macrophages. Serum from MSV tumor-bearing mice had a greater suppressive effect than did normal mouse serum. Both the suppressor cells and the suppressive serum factors may play an important role in the immunosuppression observed in tumor-bearing hosts."
4145132	"The C-terminus of mouse talin (amino acids 2345-2541) is responsible for all of the protein's f-actin binding capacity. Unlike full-length talin, the C-terminal f-actin binding domain is unable to nucleate actin polymerization. We have found that transient and stable expression of the talin actin-binding domain fused to the C-terminus of the green fluorescent protein (GFP-mTn) can visualize the actin cytoskeleton in different types of living plant cells without affecting cell morphology or function. Transiently expressed GFP-mTn co-localized with rhodamine-phalloidin in permeabilized tobacco BY-2 suspension cells, showing that the fusion protein can specifically label the plant actin cytoskeleton. Constitutive expression of GFP-mTn in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants visualized actin filaments in all examined tissues with no apparent effects on plant morphology or development at any stage during the life cycle. This demonstrates that in a number of different cell types GFP-mTn can serve as a non-invasive marker for the actin cytoskeleton. Confocal imaging of GFP-mTn labeled actin filaments was employed to reveal novel information on the in vivo organization of the actin cytoskeleton in transiently transformed, normally elongating tobacco pollen tubes."
8668863	"The induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) by ultraviolet A (UVA) (320-400 nm) radiation provides a protective cellular defence against oxidative stress, and has been well demonstrated in cultured human skin fibroblasts, although keratinocytes were unreactive. The UVA responsiveness of HO-1 however, has not been confirmed in intact skin. Previously, we reported that UVA-inducible HO enzyme activity in mouse skin is protective against UVB-induced immunosuppression. This study identifies the induced HO isoform and its localization in mouse skin irradiated in vivo with such an immunoprotective UVA dose. We found that HO-1 mRNA was expressed in UVA-irradiated skin, but not in normal or UVB-irradiated skin, whereas constitutive HO-2 was always present. UVA-irradiated skin had increased HO enzyme activity and bilirubin content, and decreased heme content, consistent with HO-1 induction. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical staining localized HO-1 mRNA and protein to both epidermis and dermis, with strongest expression in basal keratinocytes and weaker expression in dermal fibroblast-like and other cells, in contrast with UVA-induced HO-1 in cultured human skin fibroblasts. This suggests that cultured skin cells may not fully represent skin functions in vivo, or that there may be inherent differences between human and hairless mouse skin HO-1 responses."
5767018	"Malignant blue nevus is rare, and a common blue nevus rarely needs a differential diagnosis from malignant melanoma. Although a melanocytic nevus with a satellite lesion is usually suggestive of a peripherally disseminating malignant melanoma, very few cases of blue nevus with satellite lesions have been reported thus far. To our knowledge, this is the seventh case of a blue nevus with satellitosis. Periappendageal and perivascular concentrations of the nevus cells were observed in the main papule as well as in the satellite lesions. These findings suggest that blue nevus cells could infiltrate along the perivascular area in the dermis and form multiple satellite lesions. Blue nevus should be considered as a differential diagnosis when a locally disseminating malignant melanoma is suspected."
8394366	"Hepatitis B and D virus coinfection or superinfection lead to chronic liver disease and have poor treatment results and poor prognosis. After transplant, these patients have difficult problems. We aimed to report long-term data of liver transplant recipients who had hepatitis B and D virus-related chronic liver disease.                                                                                            This retrospective, longitudinal study included 25 consecutive hepatitis B surface antigen-positive patients with antihepatitis D virus antibodies. Patient data (age, sex, antiviral treatment, posttransplant use of hepatitis B hyperimmunoglobulin and/or nucleoside/nucleotide analogues, the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma, age at transplant, follow-up) were extracted from patient records.                                                                              Females comprised 32% patients. The median age was 44 years (range, 23-63 y). The serum Hepatitis B envelope antigen level was negative in all patients. At the time of transplant, 4 patients were positive for hepatitis B virus DNA and 11 patients also had hepatocellular carcinoma. Posttransplant follow-up was 59 months (range, 3-120 mo). During follow-up, 4 patients died, 4 patients were lost to follow-up, and 17 patients were alive. Posttransplant survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma was 50.45 months (range, 3-84 mo) and without hepatocellular carcinoma was 65.8 months (range, 4-120 mo). There were 3 patients who had acute rejection and were treated successfully with pulse doses of prednisolone. Hyperimmunoglobulin therapy was used in conjunction with oral nucleotide/nucleoside analogues for 12 months (range, 3-24 mo) and then stopped. After transplant, 4 patients had antiviral medicine changed to adefovir or entecavir because of drug resistance, and otherwise all patients remained negative for hepatitis B virus DNA during follow-up.                                                                                      Patients transplanted for hepatitis B and D virus cirrhosis, even with hepatocellular carcinoma, had favorable prognosis and good longterm results. Close follow-up of patients and effective viral suppression with suitable drugs were key factors for efficient patient care."
8885358	"Seedling tissues of Cyamopsis tetragonoloba (Guar) were cultured on various media to produce calli. These calli sometimes produced organs spontaneously; organogenesis was not controllable on any medium tried. Several calli were transferred to liquid shake cultures to form suspensions. One of these, along with one of the callus cultures, spontaneously turned embryogenic, producing large numbers of somatic embryoids. The embryoids could be removed and germinated on any of several media to plantlet stage, but degeneration of the root primordium precluded further development."
9947514	"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder resulting in a chloride channel (CFTR) defect characterized by multi-organ damage. The primary cause of morbidity and mortality is end-stage obstructive lung disease. Lung transplantation is a treatment option, but is complicated by the risks of acute rejection, Bronchiolitis Obliterans syndrome (BOS) (graft dysfunction), and serious infection. This study sought to assess survival free from three major complications, namely BOS, acute rejection, and serious infection and also to compare overall survival among school-age CF transplantation recipients to non-CF recipients. We limited consideration to school-age children because they comprise a unique cohort in terms of linear and graft growth, immunity, pharmacokinetics and infection exposure as compared with infants, adolescents and adults. The OPTN national database was searched for period between January 1997 and August 2006 for children between 6 and 10 years of age undergoing lung transplantation. Children with CF were compared with non-CF recipients with regard to occurrence of BOS, infection-related hospitalizations, and acute rejections. Kaplan-Meier analyses were used for statistical comparisons of the two cohorts. There were 50 CF patients and 37 non-CF patients available for analysis from the OPTN database. Up to 5 years post-transplant, there were no statistically significant differences between CF and non-CF patients in overall survival, and survival free from BOS, acute rejections, or serious infections defined as those requiring hospitalization. Despite having an underlying systemic disease based on defective CFTR, CF school-age children receiving a lung transplant do not demonstrate more major complications or lower survival than non-CF children."
1297120	"Transformation growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) inhibits transepithelial sodium transport and suppresses the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in many different types of epithelial cells; however, the molecular mechanism of this effect in the kidney is still not clear. The aim of this study was to examine the regulation of transepithelial sodium transport by TGF-beta1 in renal cells.                                                                              We derived stable mouse cortical collecting duct cell lines that overexpressed Smad4 or N-termianl truncated Smad4, and studied the effects of TGF-beta1 on them. The equivalent electrical current (I(eq)) was taken as representing transepithelial current and the amiloride sensitive short circuit current (AmsIsc) as representing the ENaC activity. We used real-time PCR to quantify the expression of ENaC and measurement of the luciferase activity of cells transiently transfected with a mouse alpha-ENaC promoter to assess the alpha-ENaC promoter activity. Result. The administration of TGF-beta1 decreased I(eq), mainly as a result of the decrease of AmsIsc, and it correlated with inhibition of the alpha-ENaC mRNA expression. The overexpression of Smad4 led to a decrease in AmsIsc, alpha-ENaC mRNA and alpha-ENaC promoter activity, but the overexpression of the N-terminal truncated Smad4 did not induce these changes. The TGF-beta1-induced reduction of AmsIsc was alleviated in the N-terminal truncated Smad4-overexpressed cells.                                                                                     It appears that the N-terminus region of Smad4 is indispensable in Smad4-mediated inhibition of the transepithelial sodium transport. TGF-beta1 may decrease the ENaC functionality via a Smad4-dependent pathway."
2588752	Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with topical 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) has been shown to be safe and effective for a variety of skin concerns. The case report described is the first successfully documented use of ALA/PDT in the therapy of recalcitrant molluscum contagiosum in HIV-positive individuals.
2417862	"The relationship between hemorrhage and low platelet count was first established in patients with acute leukemia, and has been widely applied to thrombocytopenic patients, including BMT patients. Yet, the role of thrombocytopenia in bleeding post BMT has not been systematically studied. We evaluated the risk of bleeding and outcome associated with thrombocytopenia in BMT patients who had prophylactic platelet transfusions at a trigger of 20 x 10(9)/l. Thrombocytopenia was investigated in 321 patients with moderate or severe bleeding (BLD), and in a matched comparison group of 287 patients who did not bleed (NBLD). Profound thrombocytopenia (<    or = 10 x 10(9)/l) was found in 8.6% of the BLD patients during the week before the bleeding onset, significantly more frequent than in NBLD patients (2.1% to 4%, P <    0.02), during weeks 2 to 6 post BMT (the period when 75% of the bleeding initiated). On the first day of bleeding, platelet counts <    or = 10 x 10(9)/l were found in 13.5%, 11-20 x 10(9)/l in 20.4%, and >    20 x 10(9)/l in 66.1% of all episodes. Overall survival in BLD patients was not associated with the severity of thrombocytopenia before bleeding onset. Severity of thrombocytopenia was significantly associated with reduced survival in NBLD patients. We concluded that bleeding post BMT was significantly associated with thrombocytopenia, but the attributable risk of bleeding from profound thrombocytopenia was not large. Thrombocytopenia may be an important clinical sign in NBLD patients, and should be further explored in relation to acute toxicities other than bleeding."

The granular deposits of IgM and IgG in the dermoepidermal junction had a pattern similar to that found in lupus erythematosus. These findings support a humoral immune response secondary to scabetic infestation."
5019932	"The reported mean age of onset of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is between 20 and 24 years. Prepubertal onset is thought to be rare.                                                                                  We sought to determine the prevalence of early-onset HS and to compare clinical characteristics between early-onset and normal-onset HS in a retrospective study.                                                                              Data were collected from 855 patients with HS. Early-onset HS was defined as onset before the thirteenth birthday. Clinical characteristics were analyzed in relation to the age of onset.                                                                              In all, 66 patients (7.7%) reported early-onset HS. A family history for HS was significantly higher in early-onset patients (55.6% vs 34.2%; odds ratio 2.1, 95% confidence interval 1.2-3.6, P = .006). They developed inflammatory lesions at more body sites than patients with normal-onset HS (odds ratio 3.0, 95% confidence interval 1.8-4.9, P <    .001). Distribution of the Hurley stages of severity showed no differences between the 2 groups (odds ratio 1.1, 95% confidence interval 0.7-1.8, P = .72).                                                                                      Some data were based on patient-reported information.                                                                                     Early-onset HS occurs more frequently than previously believed. Patients with early-onset HS often report a family history for HS and develop lesions at more body sites."
8903520	"We studied 13 desmoplastic trichoepitheliomas associated with intradermal nevi. Ten intradermal nevi were found among 76 new cases of desmoplastic trichoepithelioma (13%); three additional examples of the combined malformation were seen in consultation. Clinically, desmoplastic trichoepithelioma associated with an intradermal nevus was typically a small, firm or hard, sometimes annular, nodule on the face, particularly the cheek, of a relatively young woman. Microscopically, the combined malformation contained narrow strands of basaloid cells and keratinous cysts in a desmoplastic stroma, intimately mixed with intradermal nests of nevocytes. Melanocytic nevi have been associated with epidermal hyperplasia resembling seborrheic keratoses, follicular cysts, trichostasis spinulosa, syringomas, basal cell carcinomas, and hair follicle formation on the soles. The frequency of the occurrence of intradermal nevus with desmoplastic trichoepithelioma and the close anatomic association of the two elements may indicate that this combined malformation is another example of epithelial induction by melanocytic nevi."
1114371	"Adolescents and young adults (AYAs, ages 15 to 40 years) with cancer have not experienced survival improvements to the same extent as younger and older patients. We compared changes in survival after myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) among children (n = 981), AYAs (n = 1218), and older adults (n = 469) who underwent transplantation over 3 time periods: 1990 to 1995, 1996 to 2001, and 2002 to 2007. Five-year survival varied inversely with age group. Survival improved over time in AYAs and paralleled that seen in children; however, overall survival did not change over time for older adults. Survival improvements were primarily related to lower rates of early treatment-related mortality in the most recent era. For all cohorts, relapse rates did not change over time. A subset of 222 AYAs between the ages of 15 and 25 at 46 pediatric or 49 adult centers were also analyzed to describe differences by center type. In this subgroup, there were differences in transplantation practices among pediatric and adult centers, although HCT outcomes did not differ by center type. Survival for AYAs undergoing myeloablative allogeneic HCT for ALL improved at a similar rate as survival for children."
7925481	"Prominent eyelashes are generally recognized as enhancing beauty and are often desired by women. Until recently, the options available to augment the prominence of eyelashes were limited to makeup, over-the-counter products, artificial eyelashes, and eyelash transplantation. Originally approved for the treatment of ocular hypertension, the prostamide, bimatoprost, is now approved for the treatment of hypotrichosis of the eyelashes. Bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03%, applied once daily to the skin of the upper eyelid margin using sterile single-use-per-eye applicators, increases eyelash growth, including length, thickness, and darkness. The effectiveness of bimatoprost for eyelash growth has been demonstrated by clinician ratings, digital image analysis, and patient-reported measures of satisfaction. The effects of bimatoprost treatment on eyelash length, thickness, and darkness are believed to result from longer anagen duration, increased hair bulb thickness, and increased melanogenesis, respectively. Dermally applied bimatoprost appears to be associated with a lower incidence of adverse events than administration of the medication as an eyedrop. This more favorable safety and tolerability profile is likely mediated by decreased exposure of ocular tissues to bimatoprost when applied dermally. Taken together, available data suggest that cutaneous application of bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% safely and effectively enhances upper eyelash growth."
4509043	"Isoprene synthase (ISPS) catalyzes the elimination of pyrophosphate from dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMADP) forming isoprene, a volatile hydrocarbon emitted from many plant species to the atmosphere. In the present work, immunological techniques were applied to study and localize ISPS in poplar leaves (Populus x canescens). Immunogold labeling using polyclonal antibodies generated against His-tagged recombinant ISPS protein detected ca. 44% of ISPS in the stroma of the chloroplasts and ca. 56% of gold particles attached to the stromal-facing side of the thylakoid membranes. ISPS isolated from leaves exhibited the same biochemical properties as the recombinant ISPS without the plastid-targeting peptide heterologous expressed in E. coli, whereas an additional C- or N-terminal His-tag changed the biochemical features of the recombinant enzyme with regard to temperature, pH, and substrate dependence. In comparison to the closely related class of monoterpene synthases from angiosperms and ISPS of oaks, the most striking feature of the poplar ISPS is a cooperative substrate dependence which is characteristic to enzymes with positive substrate activation. The detection of four immunoreactive bands in poplar leaf extracts with isoelectric points from 5.0 to 5.5 and a native molecular weight of ca. 51 kDa give reason for future studies on post-translational modifications of ISPS."
2217553	"Dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria (DSH) is an autosomal dominant skin disorder. It is also called ""reticulate acropigmentation of Dohi"" or ""symmetric dyschromatosis of the extremities"". The DSH locus has recently been mapped to chromosome 1q21 and pathogenic mutations were identified in the DSRAD gene encoding double-stranded RNA-specific adenosine deaminase in Japanese patients with DSH. We report here two novel point mutations, Q513X(1537C>   T) and R916W(2746C>   T) in the DSRAD gene identified in two Chinese families, respectively. These data suggest that mutations in DSRAD were also associated with DSH in Chinese. This is the first report on DSRAD as the causative gene of DSH in the Chinese population."
8632693	"We report a 6-year-old boy suffering from acquired epidermolysis bullosa, who presented with extensive lesions of the mucous membranes and disseminated, herpetiform and 'cluster of jewels'-like vesicles and bullae arising on erythematous plaques. Direct immunofluorescence showed linear deposits of IgG and C3 at the epidermal basement membrane zone. Indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated circulating autoantibodies (titre 1:128-1:256) directed at the blister floor of human NaCl-split skin, and reacting specifically with collagen VII of the anchoring fibrils, as demonstrated by immunoblotting. The disease was controlled with a combination of dapsone and prednisone. This case demonstrates the importance of modern immunological techniques in classifying childhood autoimmune bullous diseases, as precise diagnosis is important in determining an appropriate therapeutic regimen."
8387148	"Based on abscisic acid (ABA) inhibition of seed germination and seedling growth assays, we isolated an ABA overly sensitive mutant (abo4-1) caused by a mutation in the Arabidopsis thaliana POL2a/TILTED1(TIL1) gene encoding a catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase epsilon. The dominant, ABA-insensitive abi1-1 or abi2-1 mutations suppressed the ABA hypersensitivity of the abo4-1 mutant. The abo4/til1 mutation reactivated the expression of the silenced Athila retrotransposon transcriptional silent information (TSI) and the silenced 35S-NPTII in the ros1 mutant and increased the frequency of somatic homologous recombination (HR) approximately 60-fold. ABA upregulated the expression of TSI and increased HR in both the wild type and abo4-1. MEIOTIC RECOMBINATION11 and GAMMA RESPONSE1, both of which are required for HR and double-strand DNA break repair, are expressed at higher levels in abo4-1 and are enhanced by ABA, while KU70 was suppressed by ABA. abo4-1 mutant plants are sensitive to UV-B and methyl methanesulfonate and show constitutive expression of the G2/M-specific cyclin CycB1;1 in meristems. The abo4-1 plants were early flowering with lower expression of FLOWER LOCUS C and higher expression of FLOWER LOCUS T and changed histone modifications in the two loci. Our results suggest that ABO4/POL2a/TIL1 is involved in maintaining epigenetic states, HR, and ABA signaling in Arabidopsis."
3167873	"Vasculitis can be defined as vascular inflammation which is usually immune mediated, leading to structural and functional damage to the vessel wall. Our concept of vasculitis has been built around the events surrounding immune-complex-triggered leukocytoclastic vasculitis, while the role of lymphocyte mediated vasculitis remains largely undefined. This may be due to maintaining a stereotypic image of lymphocytic vasculitis as one associated with vascular necrosis, fibrin deposition and haemorrhage and merely substituting lymphocytes for neutrophils. Our understanding of lymphocytic vasculitis may be advanced by identifying the clinical settings in which such reactions may occur, such as autoimmune skin diseases sharing features with graft vs host disease, as well as recognizing that lymphocyte mediated inflammation may lead to a morphologically distinct group of vasculitides, apart from those associated with angiodestruction. Lymphocytic endovasculitis, lymphocytic lichenoid vasculitis and granulomatous vasculitis are potential examples of lymphocytic vasculitis that differ from the histological pattern seen in association with immune complex leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Ultimately, the proof that these vasculitides are examples of lymphocytic vasculitis will rest on new techniques emerging in molecular pathology that have the capacity of analysing the immunological events beyond the current limitations posed by routine histopathology."
2226278	"Root elongation occurs as individual cells along the growing zone increase in volume. This increase is caused by water entering the cell either by moving across the cell membrane from the apoplast via aquaporins, or entering through plasmodesmata that symplastically connect cells to each other or with the sieve element. In this investigation we used mercury, a known inhibitor of aquaporin water channels, to manipulate the water permeability of growing maize root cells. 20 micro M HgCl(2) was found to reduce root elongation by around 75% and this reduction in growth was greatest in the older growing cells, with little effect on the younger cells near the root tip. Cell hydraulic conductivity (Lp) of cells close to the root tip (at 3 mm) remained unaffected by mercury treatment in contrast to older growing and non-growing cells where Lp was greatly reduced. Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis, younger root regions were shown to express higher levels of two plasmalemma intrinsic protein genes than older root regions further away from the root tip. However, a gene encoding a tonoplast aquaporin was expressed at similar levels in both regions of the growing zone. The fluorescent tracer, carboxyfluorescein, demonstrated symplastic connection between the phloem and root cortical cells at 3 mm but not at 5 or 20 mm. The data are consistent with a decrease in symplastic continuity along the growing zone and highlight a change in the principal pathway of water uptake during the development of the growing root cell."

Leprosy, which dates back to approximately 60 bc in India, was supposed to be eliminated as a public health problem by the year 2000. With a new case detection rate between 600,000 and 700,000 yearly however, leprosy, with its sometimes devastating consequences, will be with us for many years to come. Buruli ulcer, named after the area in Uganda where prevalence was high, has spread to new areas, especially in Africa."
3846563	"Rhinosporidiosis is a chronic granulomatous lesion caused by Rhinosporidium seeberi. It frequently involves nasopharynx and ocular region. Presenting as cutaneous and subcutaneous mass is extremely rare. This report describes the FNA cytology of rhinosporidiosis occurring as a soft tissue mass in the right mid thigh region. We present a rare case of a 71-year-old male, who presented with multiple subcutaneous soft tissue mass lesions in the posteromedial aspect of mid right thigh region since 2 weeks. Local examination revealed multiple firm to hard mass with skin over the swelling was unremarkable. CT of the right thigh showed a heterogeneous lesion with infiltrative margins in the thigh. Clinically soft tissue sarcoma was considered. Diagnostic FNAC was performed showing numerous mature and immature sporangias with giant cell reaction. Hence, an excision biopsy confirmed the rhinosporidiosis. To conclude, the FNAC diagnosis of rhinosporidiosis is specific. Preoperative diagnosis is possible even in cases with unusual clinical presentations."
7548817	"To describe the evolution, risk factors and impact of nonimmune histological injury after pediatric kidney transplantation, we analyzed 245 renal allograft protocol biopsies taken regularly from the time of transplantation to 2 years thereafter in 81 consecutive rejection-free pediatric recipients of an adult-sized kidney. Isometric tubular vacuolization was present early after transplantation was not progressive, and was associated with higher tacrolimus pre-dose trough levels. Chronic tubulo-interstitial damage and tubular microcalcifications were already noted at 3 months, were progressive and had a greater association with small recipient size, male donor gender, higher donor age and female recipient gender, but not with tacrolimus exposure. Renal function assessment showed that older recipients had a significant increase in absolute glomerular filtration rate with time after transplantation, which differed from small recipients who showed no increase. It is concluded that progressive, functionally relevant, nonimmune injury is detected early after adult-sized kidney transplantation in pediatric recipients. Renal graft ischemia associated with the donor-recipient size discrepancy appears to be a greater risk factor for this chronic histological injury, suggesting that the exploration of additional therapeutic approaches to increase allograft perfusion could further extend the graft survival benefit of adult-sized kidneys transplanted into small children."
1155538	"Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common human cancer. It is thought that skewed expression of desmogleins (Dsgs) in BCC may promote tumourigenesis.

In total, 84 frozen sections from patients with various clinical or histological subtypes of BCC were analyzed. Expressions of Dsg2/Dsg3 protein and Dsg2/Dsg3 mRNA were evaluated using IHC and FISH, respectively, in BCC nests and BCC-free epidermis, and then quantitatively measured.                                                                              There was loss of correlation between Dsg2 and Dsg3 (IHC) in nodular and superficial BCC (nBCC, sBCC), and significant correlation between Dsg2 and Dsg3 (FISH) in BCC, but not nBCC and sBCC.                                                                                      Because more prominent aberrations of Dsg2/Dsg3 expression were seen at the protein than at the mRNA level in BCC, these comparative observations indicate greater importance of events at the proteome level than those at the genome level in tumour functional compartments. Different Dsg2/Dsg3 expression in sBCC and nBCC might corroborate the possibility that sBCC and nBCC are separate conditions. These results may contribute to better understanding of the biological behaviour of BCC."

9499635	"Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia (ALHE) is an uncommon, idiopathic disease that manifests as dermal or subcutaneous red or brown papules or nodules, most commonly on the head and neck. Histologically, ALHE is characterized by vascular proliferation with epithelioid endothelial cells with surrounding lymphocytic and eosinophilic infiltrate. There may be an accompanying serum eosinophilia and local lymphadenopathy. We report a case of a 32-year-old woman who presented with multiple erythematous nodules in the periauricular area and the vertex of her scalp. The nodules had been present for several months. Surgical removal of one of the lesions confirmed the histological diagnosis of ALHE. The patient was started on oral propranolol (40 mg once daily) in an effort to reduce the vascular component of the lesions. Within 6 weeks, the patient noted that several of the lesions had decreased in size, and all were less erythematous. Propranolol was subsequently stopped within a few months of initiating treatment. One lesion recurred over a year later, and propranolol was then restarted. No new lesions occurred after 2 years of follow-up."
5494752	"The thioredoxin system is of great importance for maintenance of cellular redox homeostasis. Here, we show that it has a severe influence on virulence of Botrytis cinerea, demonstrating that redox processes are important for host-pathogen interactions in this necrotrophic plant pathogen. The thioredoxin system is composed of two enzymes, the thioredoxin and the thioredoxin reductase. We identified two genes encoding for thioredoxins (bctrx1, bctrx2) and one gene encoding for a thioredoxin reductase (bctrr1) in the genome of B. cinerea. Knockout mutants of bctrx1 and bctrr1 were severely impaired in virulence and more sensitive to oxidative stress. Additionally, Δbctrr1 showed enhanced H2O2 production and retarded growth. To investigate the impact of the second major cellular redox system, glutathione, we generated deletion mutants for two glutathione reductase genes. The effects were only marginal; deletion of bcglr1 resulted in reduced germination and, correspondingly, to retarded infection as well as reduced growth on minimal medium, whereas bcglr2 deletion had no distinctive phenotype. In summary, we showed that the balanced redox status maintained by the thioredoxin system is essential for development and pathogenesis of B. cinerea, whereas the second major cellular redox system, the glutathione system, seems to have only minor impact on these processes."
8186563	"In Korea, the Organ Transplantation Act came into effect in 2000, establishing the Korean Network for Organ Sharing (KONOS) with centralized authority for organ procurement as well as for approval of donors and recipients to ensure fair organ allocation. However, the number of brain-dead donors decreased sharply, and the organ allocation system proved inefficient. The government revised the Organ Transplantation Act in August 2002, introducing an incentive system. If a transplantation hospital formed a Committee for Brain Death Evaluation and a Hospital Organ Procurement Organization, it could receive a kidney from a brain dead-donor as an incentive to foster organ procurement regardless of the KONOS wait list. The government also launched a pilot brain-dead donor registry program to strengthen Hospital Organ Procurement Organization activity. If local hospitals collaborated with specialized hospitals in organ procurement, local hospitals obtained financial incentives. But because the organ shortage problem has not been resolved, the government has proposed four initiatives: first, broadening the incentive system, which makes it possible to give each specialized hospital a choice of one of eight organs from each donor as an incentive; second, development of an Independent Organ Procurement Organization; third introduction of an opt-out system; and last, improvement of the Committee for Brain Death Evaluation system. It is uncertain which initiatives will be adopted, but changes in organ procurement systems are nonetheless considered a key to solve the organ shortage problem in Korea."

1994007	"Infectious diseases are a major source of morbidity and mortality for immunosuppressed transplant recipients and the antimicrobial chemotherapy can be often less effective in these individuals, because the contribution of underlying host defenses is absent.                                                                              The influence of co-amoxiclav on the functions of polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMNs) from renal transplant recipients were investigated.                                                                              PMNs from renal transplant recipients showed a diminished phagocytic activity with reduced phagocytosis and bactericidal activity against intracellular Klebsiella pneumoniae, compared to that seen with PMNs from healthy subjects. Co-amoxiclav significantly elicited the functions of PMNs from uremic patients, resulting in an increased percentage of ingested klebsiellae and in a higher bactericidal effect (98-99%), compared with the drug-free control system. When PMNs were collected from renal transplant recipients treated with co-amoxiclav a significant high increase in both phagocytosis and killing activity were detected, showing the co-amoxiclav capability of ""restoring"" even in vivo the depressed primary functions of PMNs.                                                                                      The interesting beneficial properties of co-amoxiclav, which result in restoring the phagocyte-dependent response in renal transplant patients both in vitro and in vivo, may make this drug more suitable for the treatment of infections in patients with defects of phagocyte functions."
1011917	"The possible advantages of stereolithographic (SLA) surgical template use have not been adequately demonstrated, and studies of the accuracy of computer-aided implant placement are few. The purpose of this in vivo study was to evaluate the accuracy of a computer-designed (SLA) surgical guide by comparing the three-dimensional positions of planned and placed implants.                                                                                            One hundred sixteen implants were inserted in partially and completely edentulous patients using multiple SLA templates. Preoperative and postoperative computed tomographic images were compared. Four deviation parameters--global, angular, depth, and lateral--were defined and calculated between the planned and actual implant positions and analyzed statistically.                                                                              The mean global deviations between planned and actual implant positions at the coronal and apical ends were 1.47 mm and 1.83 mm, respectively; the mean angular deviation was 5.09 degrees. There were significant linear correlations at the implant level between coronal and angular deviations and between coronal and apical deviations.                                                                                      The study highlighted deviations between the postoperative position and the preoperative plan at the coronal and apical portions of the implant, as well as in the angulation of the implant. Although the reported deviation values were extremely high, they do not appear to have resulted in important clinical complications. This suggests the necessity of always keeping a safety zone of at least 2 mm to avoid critical anatomical structures."

The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic and Bax apoptotic proteins in congenital naevi in correlation with p-27 protein and Ki-67 proliferative index.                                                                              Our material comprised 30 congenital naevi (eight giant) excised from children aged from 15 days to 14 years old. The immunohistochemical streptavidin-biotin method was performed on paraffin sections for the detection of Bcl-2 (cl100/D5), Bax (cl2D2) , Ki-67 (MIB-1) and p-27 (1B4) proteins with monoclonal antibodies.                                                                              Bcl-2 protein was detected in all cases showing a strong diffuse cytoplasmic expression in >   70% of the naevocytes and was preserved in the deeper parts of the naevi. On the other hand, Bax was detected in 13 of the cases, showing a fainter cytoplasmic expression in 40-50% of the naevocytes without any particular topographic distribution. Ki-67 was detected in all cases showing a limited expression in 1-2% of the nuclei mainly in the junctional and upper dermal components. p-27 protein showed a broad diffuse nuclear expression (>   70% of the nuclei) in all cases with a particular increase in the deeper parts of the naevi. Bcl-2 expression showed a parallel correlation with p-27 protein.                                                                                      Broad Bcl-2 expression in congenital naevi suggests that suppression of apoptosis may play an important role in the maintenance of naevocytes despite the low proliferative activity."
9419598	"The molecular basis of senescence and immortalization is not still understood, but one hypothesis for which there has recently been much evidence involves the shortening of telomeres. It can be hypothesized that abnormalities of telomerase contribute to the emergence of abnormal fibroblast clones in systemic sclerosis (SSc).

The frequency of the A allele in SSc (41.5%) showed no significant difference from that in the normal controls (32.1%). The frequency of the A/A alleles in SSc (18.9%) was significantly higher than in normal controls (5.1%), compared with G/G (35.8% and 40.8%, respectively; P <    0.02), G/A (45.3% and 54.1%, respectively; P <    0.01) and G/G plus G/A (81.1% and 94.9%, respectively; P <    0.01).

8054610	"In chronic uremia, cardiomyopathy manifests itself as systolic dysfunction, concentric left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, or LV dilatation. To determine the impact of renal transplantation on uremic cardiomyopathy, all dialysis patients participating in a long-term cohort study who received a successful renal transplant were followed with echocardiography. The transplanted group comprised 102 of 433 (24%) endstage renal disease (ESRD) patients. They were significantly younger and, on starting ESRD therapy, had significantly less ischemic heart disease and cardiac failure than the overall ESRD cohort. During followup, ischemic heart disease developed in only 1 patient and none experienced cardiac failure. In the 12% (n = 12) of patients with systolic dysfunction before renal transplant, fractional shortening normalized in all patients, increasing from 21.5 +/- 4.6% to 33.5 +/- 5.6% after transplantation. In the 41% (n = 41) with concentric LV hypertrophy before transplantation, the LV mass index improved from 158 +/- 39 g/m2 to 132 +/- 39 g/m2. LV dilatation was present in 32% (n = 32) of patients before transplantation. After transplantation, LV volume fell from 116 +/- 3.1 ml/m2 to 89 +/- 21 ml/m2, and LV mass index in this group fell from 166 +/- 55 g/m2 to 135 +/- 37 g/m2. It was not possible to associate risk factors characteristic of the uremic state with the improvement in cardiac structure and function, although the fall in LV mass was significantly associated with fall in blood pressure. We conclude that correction of the uremic state by renal transplantation leads to normalization of LV contractility in systolic dysfunction, regression of hypertrophy in concentric LV hypertrophy, and improvement of cavity volume in LV dilatation. The degree of improvement suggests that dialysis patients with uremic cardiomyopathy would benefit from renal transplantation."

7041938	"Histone acetylation is modulated through the action of histone acetyltransferase and deacetylase, which play key roles in the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression. We have screened the expressed sequence tag database with the yeast histone deacetylase RPD3 sequence and identified two Arabidopsis homologues, AtRPD3A and AtRPD3B. The deduced amino acid sequences of AtRPD3A and AtRPD3B show high overall homology (55% identity) to each other. AtRPD3A encodes a putative protein of 502 amino acids with 49% identity to the yeast RPD3. AtRPD3B encodes a putative protein of 471 amino acids and shares 55% amino acid identity with the yeast RPD3. Northern analysis indicated that AtRPD3A was highly expressed in the leaves, stems, flowers and young siliques of Arabidopsis plants, whereas the AtRPD3B transcript was not detected in these organs. An AtRPD3A fusion protein repressed transcription when directed to a promoter driving a reporter gene, indicating a role for AtRPD3A protein in gene repression. Arabidopsis plants were transformed with a gene construct comprising a truncated AtRPD3A cDNA in the antisense orientation driven by a strong constitutive promoter, -394tCUP. Antisense expression of AtRPD3A resulted in decreased endogenous AtRPD3A transcript and delayed flowering in transgenic Arabidopsis plants, suggesting that the transition from the vegetative to reproductive phase of development could be affected by histone acetylation. Our study demonstrates the important role of histone deacetylases in plant growth and development."

While a psychiatric explanation of causality is frequently offered, there is little evidence to support or reject the view that the condition is primarily an anxiety-based disorder.

The group scored well within established norms on both psychometric measures. On scales measuring anxiety, depression and conversion phenomena, 88% of the MMPI-2 profiles lacked elevations, and 86% of the patients lacked elevations on the STAI State and Trait Anxiety scales. Personality variables were not associated with postsurgical outcome.                                                                                      Most individuals suffering from essential hyperhidrosis lack overt psychopathology. While some patients subjectively describe symptoms of anxiety, mild depression and social isolation, these complaints appear often to be in reaction to or superimposed upon an organic disease process and not the primary cause of their condition."
5343483	"Successful cardiac transplantation requires suppression of rejection, and endomyocardial biopsy is generally used to quantify this and guide immunotherapy. Biopsy, however, is an invasive, costly, cardiac catheterization with repetition limited. Since rejection requires lymphocyte activation, an alternative method of assessing rejection dynamics might be ELISA determination of soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) levels since induction of the interleukin-2 ligand and its receptor is required. Reports suggest that sIL-2R levels rise during kidney, liver, and heart-lung allograft rejection and heart recipients have an adverse prognosis if sIL-2R is elevated postoperatively. It is unclear, however, if serial measurements or single determinations are sufficient or if change from a baseline assessment is important. The purpose of this study was to determine if an isolated sIL-2R level after heart transplant predicted endomyocardial biopsy score at that moment. To do this, we prospectively followed 60 consecutive patients after orthotopic heart transplant and correlated 479 endomyocardial biopsy scores (McAllister scale 0-10) with matched sIL-2R levels. Regression analysis demonstrated minimal relationship between sIL-2R level and biopsy score (r =.11, r2 =.01, P=.009). When the maximum sIL-2R level for each individual patient was compared with the matched biopsy score, regression analysis revealed r=.04, r2=.001, P=.8. Likewise, when all biopsy scores and sIL-2R levels for each patient were meaned, analysis showed r=.14, r2=.02, P=.26. Thus in heart transplant patients, there is poor correlation between an isolated biopsy score and matched sIL-2R level. However, when mean +/- SEM sIL-2R was determined for severe rejection (score 7-10) and compared with sIL-2R for all other grades, it was significantly higher (1600 +/- 257 vs. 423 +/- 57 U/ml; P=.012). Still, the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of an sIL-2R level above 1000 U/ml predicting severe rejection was only 52%, 63%, and 8%. It would be difficult, therefore, to use a single sIL-2R determination after heart transplant to foretell the endomyocadial biopsy score. Serial measurements or quantification of a change in sIL-2R level from baseline might be more predictive of rejection severity."

The skin brightness of the face was measured using the Janus     ®       which is a facial analysis system. Cutometer     ®       the elasticity was measured by on the cheeks, and PRIMOS lite     ®       was used to evaluate wrinkles on crow's feet.                                                                              Latitude and skin brightness showed a positive correlation (0.346). Also, the correlations of Ra and R2 with skin brightness were significantly negative (-0.181) and positive (0.105), respectively. Results of comparison of Ra and R2 with age among the countries showed no significant difference among the 20s, but there was a significant difference among the 50s between countries with high latitude and low latitude.                                                                                     The long-term exposure of UV radiation, the natural environmental factor, seems to have more decisive effect on the skin aging process than the photoprotective effect of melanin of epidermal skin. This study helps to understand differences of the skin properties among countries in Asia."
8230201	The purpose of the present study was to examine possible epithelial cell membrane changes in lichen planus affected oral mucosa by the use of the lectins concanavalin-A and ricinus communis agglutinin fraction I. It was shown that these lectins in contrast to what was found in normal epithelium do not bind to the cell membranes of basal cells of lichen planus affected epithelium. The lack of binding of lectins suggests changes in exposed carbohydrates at the surfaces of the cells. The findings may support the hypothesis of antigenic changes in the lichen planus affected epithelium.
9567922	"Severe pustular psoriasis von Zumbusch type is a therapeutic challenge not only in adults, but even more in children. We report a 3(1/2)-year-old boy who developed a generalized flare of diffusely scattered pustules on erythematous skin which rapidly progressed to large exuding areas. The clinical presentation and investigations including histopathological examination of a biopsy and negative bacterial cultures were consistent with the diagnosis of pustular psoriasis von Zumbusch type. Upon initial treatment with methylprednisolone, acitretin and antibiotics the extent of the disease declined. However, several attempts to reduce the dose of the oral corticosteroid were followed by immediate severe flares. Additional treatment with narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB, 311-313 nm UVB) resulted in a rapid arrest of disease activity and allowed the corticosteroid to be tapered off. After 10 irradiations the patient was both off steroid and disease free. NB-UVB therapy was subsequently reduced to twice-weekly exposures and acitretin gradually diminished to a maintenance dose of 0.3 mg kg(-1) daily. We conclude that NB-UVB in conjunction with acitretin is a potent therapeutic regimen for the treatment of severe pustular psoriasis von Zumbusch type in childhood."
4725527	"Acquired hypertrichosis lanuginosa (AHL) is a rare cutaneous disorder that involves spontaneous growth of lanugo-type hair in association with overt or occult malignant neoplasms. Bronchopulmonary and gastrointestinal malignancies are most commonly associated.                                                                                        We report the occurrence of AHL associated with metastatic prostate cancer and its abrupt resolution after bilateral orchiectomy. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of an association with prostate cancer.                                                                                      The case presented represents a single patient; therefore, the findings and results reported may not be applicable to all patient populations.                                                                                     A variety of cutaneous findings are considered warning indicators of underlying neoplastic disease. Physician awareness of such signs can prompt timely and potentially life-saving investigations and interventions. AHL is regarded as such a sign. Physician awareness of the addition of prostate cancer to the growing list of AHL-associated malignancies provides rationale for appropriate testing and referral."
9752456	"A prospective study was undertaken in 12 haemodialysed patients successively treated on five new as well as re-used dialyser membranes, that is cuprophane, cellulose acetate, polysulphone, polycarbonate, and polyacrylonitrile. A significant reduction of neutrophils occurred with every membrane during their first use, which improved only with cuprophane upon re-use. Thrombocytopenia was noted only when neutropenia reached very low values. Monocyte reduction occurred on cuprophane, cellulose acetate and polycarbonate, but did not improve during second use. C3d accumulation paralleled the time course of neutropenia only with cuprophane and cellulose acetate. Plasma collected at the extreme of neutropenia induced aggregation of control and predialysis cells, but did not aggregate autologous dialysed neutrophils collected at 5 min. Our data indicate that the mechanism linking complement activation to neutropenia is probably triggered by more than one factor."
9162928	A report of the ninth and tenth cases of myotonic dystrophy associated with pilomatricomas and a review of the previously reported eight cases showed that seven of the ten patients had multiple pilomatricomas. Six of ten patients had another relative with both myotonic dystrophy and pilomatricomas. Patients with both myotonic dystrophy and pilomatricomas are more likely to have multiple tumors and to have a familial occurrence. The prevalence of pilomatricomas in patients with myotonic dystrophy is higher than in the general population. Pilomatricomas may be a cutaneous manifestation of the myotonic syndrome.
8277841	"The mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor everolimus (RAD001) is a successfully used immunosuppressant in solid-organ transplantation. Several studies have already used RAD001 in combination with calcineurin inhibitors after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We investigated calcineurin inhibitor-free pre- and post-transplantation immunosuppression of RAD001 combined with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in a nonmyeloablative HSCT setting. After nonmyeloablative conditioning with 2 Gy total body irradiation, 8 dogs received HSCT from dog leukocyte antigen-identical siblings. Immunosuppressives were given at doses of 1.5 mg RAD001 twice daily from day -1 to +49, then tapered until day +56, and 20 mg/kg MMF from day 0 to +28, then tapered until day +42. An historical cyclosporin A (CsA)/MMF regimen was used in the control group. All dogs engrafted. Median platelet nadir amounted in all dogs to 0 × 10(9)/L (median, day +10; duration <   50 × 10(9)/L, 22 days) and median leukocyte nadir was 1.0 × 10(9)/L (range, .1 to 2.5 × 10(9)/L; median, day +13). Eventually, 5 of 8 (63%) animals rejected their grafts. Two dogs died of infections on day +19 and +25. Pharmacokinetics of RAD001 and MMF showed median trough levels of 19.1 (range, 10.5 to 43.2) μg/L and .3 (.1 to 1.3) mg/L, respectively. The median area under the curve was 325 (range, 178 to 593) μg/L × hour for RAD001 and 29.6 (range, 7.9 to 40.5) ng/L × hour for MMF. All dogs developed clinically mucosal viral infections during the clinical course. Compared with the control group, the level of toxicities for RAD001/MMF increased in all qualities. Combined immunosuppression of RAD001 and MMF after nonmyeloablative HSCT is associated with significant toxicities, including a prolonged platelet recovery time as well as increased infections compared to the CsA/MMF regimen."
9414588	"We have examined cells from amniotic fluid obtained at 17 and 21 weeks' gestation and fetal skin biopsy samples from a fetus at risk of harlequin ichthyosis by light and electron microscopy. Clumps of abnormally keratinized cells that had a large number of lipid droplets in the cytoplasm were seen within both the 17- and 21-week amniotic fluid cell pellets. The cells in these clumps were similar to the thick layers of keratinized cells observed in the skin biopsy and autopsy samples. Morphologic examination of the fetal skin biopsy samples obtained at 21 weeks gestation revealed the characteristic changes of harlequin ichthyosis. The intraepidermal portions of hair canals had an excessive number of layers of keratinized cells. Normal lamellar granules were absent but abundant membrane-bound vesicles of a similar size and a number of dense bodies were observed in the cells of the upper intermediate layers of the epidermis. Autopsy skin samples of the terminated fetus at the twenty-third week of gestation showed structural changes that corresponded to those of the amniotic fluid cells and the fetal skin biopsy samples, although the periderm was gone in all the regions. Our findings of amniotic fluid indicate that the characteristic epidermal abnormality of harlequin ichthyosis has been expressed at 17 weeks gestation in some parts of the body or structures of fetal skin (e.g., hair canals) that keratinize before interfollicular epidermis. Moreover, the results suggest that harlequin ichthyosis can be detected in utero by morphologic analysis of amniotic fluid cells obtained by amniocentesis."
9998552	"We describe a patient transfused with 200 ml of donor fresh whole blood three times at 2-week intervals. Three weeks after the last transfusion, transplantation and splenectomy were done at the same time. Splenic cells from this DST pretreated patient were fused with murine myeloma cells (X63-Ag8, 653). With DST pretreatment, various clones were developed in vivo, and finally 69 human immunoglobulin-secreting clones were obtained. Modulation of the alloantigen-specific MLR by supernatants from 69 clones showed various degrees of suppression or augmentation. The hybridoma clone 7 and clone 2, which had been secreting IgG antibody for more than 6 months, showed some degree of suppression in the alloantigen-specific MLR (mean suppression = 63%, 46% respectively). According to the result of MLR, clone 7 antibody was directed against recipient lymphocytes and clone 2 antibody was against donor lymphocytes. Immunoprecipitation was carried out by clone 7-IgG and clone 2-IgG. Clone 7-IgG specifically precipitated 1 molecule from the recipient lymphocyte with a molecular weight of 120 KD, similar to the molecular weight range reported for T cell receptors. Clone 2-IgG precipitated a 20 KD molecule from the donor lymphocyte. The data suggest that DST induces antibodies directed against the blood donor alloantigen-specific receptors on the recipient's T lymphocytes--and, at the same time, induces antibodies against donor lymphocyte antigens. These antibodies may be essential to prolongation of kidney allograft survival following DST."
6357607	"Few studies comprehensively assessed psychological and behavioral functioning in adolescent kidney transplant patients. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate depression, QOL, treatment adherence and presence of side effects from the perspective of the patient and his parents, and to compare scores with norm data. All patients (age 10-18 yr) and their parents completed the following instruments: KIDSCREEN-27 (QOL), a treatment adherence interview, the MTSOSD-59R (side effects) and the Beck Depression Inventory (depression). Twenty-three of 26 patients and 22 parents agreed to participate (70% male; median age 15 yr). Adolescents rated their QOL as satisfactory, but parents reported significant problems on several QOL dimensions. Depressive symptoms occurred in 17.4%, and 75% were non-adherent with their immunosuppressive drugs (confirmed by their parents) and show other problematic health behavior, including smoking, illicit drug use, dietary non-adherence, and suboptimal exercise levels. The most frequently occurring side effects were increased appetite, fatigue and headache; the most distressing ones were hair loss or thinning of hair, warts on hands or feet, and sores in the mouth or on the lips. Our results underscore the need for regular screening and adequate treatment of the above-mentioned aspects."
8949387	"With a growing understanding of the pathogenesis and immunological basis of psoriasis, the medical community has seen the development of more focused biological treatment options for patients suffering from the disease, which are beginning to revolutionize the treatment of psoriasis. It is already well known that certain biologics are associated with an increased risk of reactivating tuberculosis in patients with latent disease, however, with increasing use of biologic agents across indications, there has also been a rise in reports of associated deep fungal infections. The mechanism of action of these biologic anti-psoriatic therapies allows physicians to address the underlying cause of patients' symptoms. The question though, is whether this same therapeutic mechanism may predispose patients to serious infections, including deep fungal infections."
9380154	"As part of a study of the mechanism of metronidazole's efficacy in the treatment of acne and rosacea, its effects on the endocrine milieu and sebum excretion rate were assessed. Thirteen healthy males received oral metronidazole treatment (500 mg/day) for 4 weeks. Serum sex hormone levels were determined in all 13 subjects and the sebum excretion rate was determined in seven of them, before and after treatment. We measured serum levels of estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), total testosterone (T), free testosterone (FT), dihydrotestosterone (DHT), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). There were no significant changes in E1, T, FT, DHT, or SHBG levels, but E2 and DHEA-S levels decreased significantly after treatment. In all seven subjects in whom the sebum excretion rates were determined, the amount of facial skin surface lipids decreased significantly after treatment. These results suggest that metronidazole exerts its clinical effects through suppressing the sebum excretion by a mechanism other than anti-androgenic action."
1783158	"Currents that leak out of wounds generate electric fields lateral to the wound. These fields induce directional locomotion of human keratinocytes in vitro and may promote wound healing in vivo. We have examined the effects of growth factors and calcium, normally present in culture medium and the wound fluid, on the directional migration of human keratinocytes in culture. In electric fields of physiologic strength (100 mV per mm), keratinocytes migrated directionally towards the cathode at a rate of about 1 microm per min. This directional migration requires several growth factors. In the absence of these growth factors, the cell migration rate decreased but directionality was maintained. Epidermal growth factor alone restored cell migration rates at concentrations as low as 0.2 ng per ml. Insulin at 5-100 microg per ml or bovine pituitary extract at 0.2%-2% vol/vol also stimulated keratinocyte motility but was not sufficient to fully restore the migration rate. Keratinocyte migration in electric fields requires extracellular calcium. Changes in calcium concentrations from 3 microM to 3.3 mM did not significantly change keratinocyte migration rate nor directionality in electric fields; however, addition of the chelator ethyleneglycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid to migration medium reduced, and eventually abolished, keratinocyte motility. Our results show that (i) growth factors and extracellular calcium are required for electric field-induced directional migration of human keratinocytes, and (ii) keratinocytes migrate equally well in low and high calcium media."
1146558	"Although skin is the largest organ of the body, there are no standardized reproducible methods for assessing severity of many skin diseases. Due to lack of consensus, methods of assessment and inexistence of precise scoring system, there is no application for vitiligo estimation in real practice. In this paper the author describes VETI score as a new treatment evaluation criteria and severity assessment method for vitiligo. This new tool, as does the PASI score in psoriasis, may be able to produce a constant and reproducible number and to help clinical research on vitiligo patients. Additionally it has a potential to be a source of any computed application for researchers working on vitiligo patients."
2224772	"The cost effectiveness of treatments for psoriasis has been evaluated previously by several different investigators. Such evaluations should be updated as new products or data become available. To this end, a comparison of expected treatment-related clinical and economic outcomes is undertaken from the payer perspective using a disease-intervention model, decision analyses, and newly emergent information. The model is based on academy guidelines and recommended clinical practice. Model inputs (clinical and cost data) are culled from the medical literature and advisory clinical assessment surveys. Comparable therapies are various topical pharmacotherapies and phototherapies, including the 308-nm excimer laser (XTRAC, PhotoMedex, Montgomeryville, PA). Analytic results indicate that clinical and economic outcomes are influenced by treatment selections but are muted by the rotational nature of treatment regimens. Multiple analyses are required to reveal individual product performance. On the basis of these analyses, the addition of the 308-nm excimer laser to the rotational mix of treatments commonly utilized as second-line therapies for mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis is expected to add incremental clinical benefit for patients without incremental cost for payers, because the laser can replace both more costly and less costly alternatives for appropriately selected patients who require a different therapeutic modality to maintain or improve their responsiveness."
6910895	"Psoriasiform lesions are characterized by hyperproliferation and aberrant differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes, accompanied by inflammation, leading to a disrupted skin barrier with an abnormal stratum corneum. The expression and proteolytic processing of caspase 14, a member of the caspase family which is associated with epithelial cell differentiation, planned cell death, and barrier formation, is altered in psoriatic epidermis. We recently reported that human psoriatic tissues lack normal expression of caspase 14 [J Dermatol Sci37 (2005) 61], and caspase 14 is induced by EGCG, a green tea polyphenol (GTP), in exponentially growing normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) [J Pharmacol Exp Ther315 (2005) 805]. This suggests that GTPs may have beneficial effects on psoriasiform lesions. The current study aimed to determine whether MAPK pathways are required for GTP-induced caspase 14 expression in NHEK and if GTPs can modulate the expression of pathological markers in the psoriasiform lesions that develop in the flaky skin mouse. The results indicate that the p38 and JNK MAPK pathways are required for EGCG-induced expression of caspase 14 in NHEK. Importantly, topical application of 0.5% GTPs significantly reduced the symptoms of epidermal pathology in the flaky skin mice, associated with efficient caspase 14 processing and reduction in proliferating cell nuclear antigen levels. This suggests that GTP-activated pathways may be potential targets for novel therapeutic approaches to the treatment of some psoriasiform skin disorders."
4782660	"Topical antimicrobial therapy is increasingly important in the treatment of canine pyoderma as the incidence of multidrug resistance has risen. However, little information is reported on the persistence of activity of topical antimicrobial products.                                                                                  To determine the residual antibacterial activity of canine hairs treated with antimicrobial sprays.                                                                              Twelve privately owned dogs with no history of dermatological disease.                                                                              Dogs were treated once with four different spray products [(A) 1% chlorhexidine digluconate, (B) 2% miconazole nitrate, 2% chlorhexidine gluconate, tromethamine USP/disodium EDTA (TrizEDTA), (C) 3% chlorhexidine gluconate, phytosphingosine salicyloyl and (D) 4% chlorhexidine gluconate, TrizEDTA] in separate 5 × 5 cm sections on the trunk. Hairs were collected via shaving before, one hour after and 2, 4, 7 and 10 days after treatment. Hairs were incubated on agar plates streaked with Staphylococcus pseudintermedius for 24 h and the bacterial growth inhibition zone around the hairs was measured.                                                                              There were significant overall treatment and day (P <    0.0001) differences in inhibition zones. The largest zones of inhibition were from hairs treated with spray B, followed by sprays D, C and A, respectively. All sprays demonstrated residual antimicrobial activity for the ten days evaluated.                                                                                                                Results suggest that the efficacy of an antimicrobial spray is dependent on both the concentration and combination of active ingredients. Several ingredient profiles appear to effectively inhibit S. pseudintermedius growth for at least 10 days, which may be beneficial in the treatment of canine pyoderma."
2882791	"Etanercept is approved for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis at a dose of 50 mg twice weekly for 3 months followed by a maintenance dosage of 50 mg weekly thereafter. Clinical studies have shown excellent efficacy, favorable benefit to side-effects ratio, and safe long-term usage. Extensive information on safety is available as etanercept has been used for many years for other indications such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis and is the first of the tumor necrosis factor antagonists to gain approval in psoriasis."
3868050	"Jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway in plants is activated against various developmental processes as well as biotic and abiotic stresses. The Jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) protein family, the key regulator of plant JA signaling pathway, also participates in phytohormone crosstalk. This is the first study revealing the in vivo interactions of finger millet (Eleusine coracana (L.) Gaertn.) JAZ protein (EcJAZ) under methyl jasmonate (MJ) treatment. The aim of the study was to explore not only the JA signaling pathway but also the phytohormone signaling crosstalk of finger millet, a highly important future crop. From the MJ-treated finger millet seedlings, the EcJAZ interacting proteins were purified by affinity chromatography with the EcJAZ-matrix. Twenty-one proteins of varying functionalities were successfully identified by MALDI-TOF-TOF Mass spectrometry. Apart from the previously identified JAZ binding proteins, most prominently, EcJAZ was found to interact with transcription factors like NAC, GATA and also with Cold responsive protein (COR), etc. that might have extended the range of functionalities of JAZ proteins. Moreover, to evaluate the interactions of EcJAZ in the JA-co-receptor complex, we generated ten in-silico models containing the EcJAZ degron and the COI1-SKP1 of five monocot cereals viz., rice, wheat, maize, Sorghum and Setaria with JA-Ile or coronatine. Our results indicated that the EcJAZ protein of finger millet could act as the signaling hub for the JA and other phytohormone signaling pathways, in response to a diverse set of stressors and developmental cues to provide survival fitness to the plant."
6703142	"We report a consecutive single center series of 261 patients who received first orthotopic heart transplants from 1986 to 1997. The 1- and 5-year graft survivals were 78 and 68%. The influence of histocompatibility was investigated by comparing graft survival and numbers of treated rejection episodes with HLA-A, -B, and -DR mismatches over different time periods.                                                                               Recipients with six mismatches for HLA-A+-B+-DR combined (13.4%) had reduced survival at 7 years (47%) when compared with other recipients (64%). In the first year of transplant, recipients with four HLA-A+-B mismatches had significantly reduced actuarial graft survival (P=0.03) with the greatest influence apparent at 6 months [0-3 mismatches (n=193) 85% versus 4 mismatches (n=68) 69%; P=0.005, OR=2.1]. For 182 recipients with functioning hearts at 1 year, the number of rejection episodes treated within this time was strongly influenced by HLA-DR mismatch [0 DR mismatch (n=15) mean 1.2 rejection episodes versus 1 DR mismatch (n=76) mean 2.7 rejection episodes versus 2 DR mismatches (n=91) mean 3.8 rejection episodes: P=0.0002]. Of these 182 transplants, recipients who had more than four treated rejection episodes during the first year had a significantly reduced 7- year survival [<   5 rejection episodes (n=133) 85% versus more than four rejection episodes (n=49) 66%; P=0.02, OR=3.4], as did those with two HLA-DR mismatches [0+1 mismatch (n=91) 87% versus 2 mismatches (n=91) 70%; P<   0.05, OR=2.4].                                                                                         We show that graft loss in the first 6 months of transplant is significantly influenced by four HLA-A+-B mismatches. HLA-DR mismatch significantly increases the number of rejection episodes within the first year, without influencing graft survival. After 12 months both >   4 rejection episodes in the first year and two HLA-DR mismatches are markers for late graft loss. We postulate that immunological graft loss in the first 6 months is dominated by the direct allorecognition pathway driven by HLA-DR mismatch. This mechanism is later lost or suppressed. Our data highlight HLA-DR mismatch as a marker for late graft loss and we show an advantage to avoiding transplanting hearts with six HLA-A+-B+-DR mismatches and to minimizing HLA-DR mismatches whenever possible."
4088182	"Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) is a rare cause of the nephrotic syndrome in adults and children. Though small focal crescents may be seen in up to 10% of cases of MPGN, the presence of more than 50% crescents (crescentic MPGN) is rare. Very few cases of crescentic transformation of MPGN, documented by subsequent renal biopsies, have been described in the literature. A young female patient underwent kidney biopsy for the nephrotic-nephritic syndrome and was diagnosed as idiopathic MPGN. She was administered immunosuppressive therapy (steroids and cyclophosphamide), with which her renal functions stabilized. Six months later, she presented with features suggestive of rapidly progressive renal failure and underwent a second renal biopsy. The second biopsy showed crescentic glomerulonephritis with immune complex deposition, suggestive of MPGN. A final diagnosis of crescentic transformation of MPGN was made. Crescentic transformation of MPGN is a rare occurrence, but needs to be considered in a patient diagnosed as MPGN and presenting with rapidly progressive renal failure. The cause of such transformation remains to be elucidated."
5483658	"A 40-year-old man developed a generalized erythematous rash, fever, and systemic lymphadenopathy after treatment for two months with anticonvulsants including phenytoin. Laboratory examinations revealed increased white blood cell counts with eosinophilia, abnormal liver function, and increased gammaglobulin levels. A lymphocyte stimulation test showed a significant stimulation index for phenytoin. Skin biopsy findings were nonspecific cellular infiltrates in the upper dermis whereas in lymph nodes the normal architecture was replaced by massive cellular infiltrates consisting largely of lymphocytes, immunoblasts, and eosinophils suggesting a pattern of phenytoin lymphadenopathy. No malignant changes were noted. Phenytoin was discontinued and after a two-month treatment with oral corticosteroids, all manifestations had nearly subsided. However, the patient should be carefully followed up since phenytoin occasionally induces lymphoproliferative states including malignant lymphoma even after cessation of the medication."
2678497	"Legumes, with their unique ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, play a vital role in ensuring future food security and mitigating the effects of climate change because they use less fossil energy and produce less greenhouse gases compared with N-fertilized systems. Grain legumes are second only to cereal crops as a source of human and animal food, and they contribute approximately one third of the protein consumed by the human population. The productivity of seed crops, such as grain legumes, is dependent on flowering. Despite the genetic variation and importance of flowering in legume production, studies of the molecular pathways that control flowering in legumes are limited. Recent advances in genomics have revealed that legume flowering pathways are divergent from those of such model species as Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we discuss the current understanding of flowering time regulation in legumes and highlight the unique and conserved features of floral evocation in legumes."
4437696	"We examined the cytokine profiles associated with tolerance and rejection using the mouse model of neonatal tolerance. BALB/c mice primed with CAF1 splenocytes during the neonatal stage showed increased A/J skin graft survival of >    60 days and failed to develop anti-A/J cytotoxic responses, but rejected third-party C57BL/6 grafts. Lymph node cells that drained A/J grafts on neonatal-primed mice produced allospecific immune cytokine responses characterized by high IL-4 and low IFN-gamma levels. In contrast, lymph node cells that drained either rejected third-party grafts or rejected A/J grafts placed on adult controls produced less IL-4 and more IFN-gamma. Tolerogen-specific immune responses from neonatal-primed mice made up to 100 times higher IL-4 to IFN-gamma ratios than did controls. Alloantigen priming during the immediate neonatal stage induced constitutive expression of IL-4 mRNA in the spleen without IFN-gamma mRNA, whereas alloantigen stimulation during adulthood induced the opposite pattern. IL-4 production from neonatal primed mice was confined to the CD4 population. The altered cytokine profile of enhanced IL-4/IFN-gamma in neonatal primed mice persisted for up to 12 weeks after priming in in vitro secondary MLR assays, which suggests that the initial timing of antigen stimulation critically influenced CD4 maturation. The results support a model of immunoredirection as a mechanism of tolerance and provide rationale for examining the therapeutic use of cytokines in transplantation."
4382785	"Despite the fact that several hundred glycosyltransferases have been identified from sequencing of plant genomes, the biological functions of only a handful have been established to date. A Poplar glycosyltransferase 64 (GT64) family member that is differentially expressed during the cell division and elongation phases of cambial growth was identified from previously generated transcript profiling of cambium tissues. The predicted Poplar GT64 protein has a closely related Arabidopsis homolog ECTOPICALLY PARTING CELLS (EPC1). Mutation of the EPC1 gene, one of three Arabidopsis GT64 family members, results in plants with a dramatically reduced growth habit, defects in vascular formation and reduced cell-cell adhesion properties in hypocotyl and cotyledon tissues. Secondary growth is enhanced in epc1 hypocotyl tissues and it is proposed that this results from the abnormal cell-cell adhesion within the cortical parenchyma cell layers. Loss of cell-cell contacts within cotyledon and leaf tissues is also proposed to account for vascular patterning defects and the fragile nature of epc1 tissues. The EPC1 protein thus plays a critical role during plant development in maintaining the integrity of organs via cell-cell adhesion, thereby providing mechanical strength and facilitating the movement of metabolites throughout the plant."
6197600	"Conifer stem pest resistance includes constitutive defenses that discourage invasion and inducible defenses, including phenolic and terpenoid resin synthesis. Recently, methyl jasmonate (MJ) was shown to induce conifer resin and phenolic defenses; however, it is not known if MJ is the direct effector or if there is a downstream signal. Exogenous applications of MJ, methyl salicylate, and ethylene were used to assess inducible defense signaling mechanisms in conifer stems. MJ and ethylene but not methyl salicylate caused enhanced phenolic synthesis in polyphenolic parenchyma cells, early sclereid lignification, and reprogramming of the cambial zone to form traumatic resin ducts in Pseudotsuga menziesii and Sequoiadendron giganteum. Similar responses in internodes above and below treated internodes indicate transport of a signal giving a systemic response. Studies focusing on P. menziesii showed MJ induced ethylene production earlier and 77-fold higher than wounding. Ethylene production was also induced in internodes above the MJ-treated internode. Pretreatment of P. menziesii stems with the ethylene response inhibitor 1-methylcyclopropene inhibited MJ and wound responses. Wounding increased 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) oxidase protein, but MJ treatment produced a higher and more rapid ACC oxidase increase. ACC oxidase was most abundant in ray parenchyma cells, followed by cambial zone cells and resin duct epithelia. The data show these MJ-induced defense responses are mediated by ethylene. The cambial zone xylem mother cells are reprogrammed to differentiate into resin-secreting epithelial cells by an MJ-induced ethylene burst, whereas polyphenolic parenchyma cells are activated to increase polyphenol production. The results also indicate a central role of ray parenchyma in ethylene-induced defense."
5759098	"This prospective study was performed to examine the safety and efficacy of a continuous infusion of ceftazidime in patients who developed febrile neutropenia after high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) and autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) and to determine if the underlying disease represents a risk factor for infectious complications. From September 1995 to May 2000, 55 patients with breast cancer (BC, group I, 54 females, one male) and 32 patients with multiple myeloma (MM, group II, 10 female, 22 male) were included in this study. The febrile patients received a 2 g intravenous bolus of ceftazidime, followed by a 4 g continuous infusion over 24 h using a portable infusion pump. If the fever persisted for 72 h a glycopeptide antibiotic was added. The median age was 42 years (range 22-59) in group I and 52 years (range 35-63) in group II. Thirty-five BC patients (64%) and 20 MM patients (63%) responded to the monotherapy with ceftazidime. After addition of a glycopeptide antibiotic, an additional 11 BC patients vs 10 MM patients became afebrile. The causes of fever in group I were fever of unknown origin (FUO) in 49 patients, microbiologically documented infection (MDI) in five patients, and clinically documented infection (CDI) in one patient. The causes of fever in group II were FUO in 22 patients, MDI in eight patients and CDI in two patients. Forty-one febrile episodes in BC patients (75%) and 22 episodes in the MM patients (69%) were successfully managed by out-patient treatment, resulting in a saving of an average of 20 days of inpatient care. Significantly more episodes of MDI and CDI occurred in patients with MM (P = 0.05). The results indicate that BC and MM patients with febrile neutropenia after HDCT and PBSCT can be treated as outpatients with close monitoring to ensure safety. This approach represents a better use of health care resources."
4231227	"Maintenance dialysis therapy is the only way to remove excess fluid in patients with anuric end-stage renal disease. The optimal ultrafiltration (UF) volume in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) remains controversial.                                                                              We retrospectively analysed a cohort of 86 prevalent anuric PD patients followed up for a median of 25.3 months (range, 6 to 54 months). Clinical and PD parameters were recorded yearly. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify risk factors of mortality and technique failure in patients with a UF >   /=1 L/24 h or <   1 L/24 h.                                                                              When compared to those with a UF <   1 L/24 h, patients with a UF >   /=1 L/24 h had significantly higher haemoglobin levels (101.9 +/- 20.5 vs 89.3 +/- 20.2 g/L, P <    0.05) and tended to be younger (55.0 +/- 12.5 vs 60.6 +/- 16.1 years, P = 0.10). Also, while Kt/V and CCr were stable over time, UF decreased significantly over the study period (baseline, 1205.5 +/- 327.3 ml/24 h vs after 3 years, 870.6 +/- 439.8 ml/24 h; P <    0.001). Using Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients with baseline UF <   1 L/24 h had significantly worse outcome (survival, 27.2 +/- 3.9 vs 42.4 +/- 1.9 months; P <    0.001). In multivariate Cox regression analysis, age, time-dependent UF volume and serum albumin were independent predictors of mortality, while UF independently predicted technique failure.                                                                                      The present study demonstrates a strong predictive value of daily peritoneal UF for both technique and patient survival in prevalent anuric PD patients. Identifying markers of satisfactory fluid status, as well as optimizing therapy to meet UF goals, remains an important clinical target."
9341999	"Based on clinical features, infantile seborrheic dermatitis (ISD) can be classified as follows: true seborrheic dermatitis (SD), psoriasiform seborrheic dermatitis (Psor SD), and erythrodermic seborrheic dermatitis. We reviewed the records of 72 children who had been affected by ISD several years earlier to investigate the evolution of disease, to evaluate the patients for the presence of new skin lesions, and to study family histories with respect to these conditions. In addition, we attempted to determine if there is any connection among the initial features of ISD and the types of skin lesions, and atopy or psoriasis. On reexamination, our patients previously diagnosed as having SD showed a larger variety of new skin lesions than those who had Psor SD, and 15% had developed atopic dermatitis. Atopic dermatitis was not present at follow-up in the children with previously diagnosed Psor SD. Psoriatic lesions were present in similar percentages in both groups at the time of reevaluation. Investigation of family history was not useful in predicting later development of psoriasis or atopic dermatitis. We conclude that the initial clinical features of ISD may be of prognostic value, and that SD and Psor SD are probably two different clinical entities."
6812987	"Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare and potentially fatal disorder of unknown etiology arising from the accumulation of epidermal Langerhans-like cells in bone, skin, or other tissues. Tissue damage and morbidity results from lesional cytokine release, and we sought to investigate the LCH microenvironment using a combination of histological stains and immunohistochemistry.                                                                              CD1a immunoreactivity was used to identify lesional cells in archival paraffin-embedded samples of cutaneous LCH. A combined Orcein and Giemsa stain identified immune cells in general (particularly granulocytes and mast cells) and extracellular matrix (particularly elastic fibers), while CD3 and CD68 staining identified T cells and macrophages, respectively. Collagen synthesis was investigated with Herovici staining, which discriminates newly synthesized from mature collagen, while cross-polar microscopy of picrosirius-stained sections identified changes in matrix organization.                                                                              Immune cells were consistently identified at the periphery of cutaneous LCH lesions. We quantified an increased number of thickened and disorganized elastic fibers surrounding lesions and an absence of elastic fibers within lesions. Furthermore, lesions exhibited a decrease in mature collagen fibers and a loss of supporting collagen matrix within lesions and compromised collagen integrity in adjacent tissue.                                                                                      Cutaneous LCH lesions are associated with the peripheral recruitment of a variety of immune cells and are consistently characterized by localized elastosis, collagen damage, and remodeling."
9389598	"Improved viability and function of insulin-producing beta (B) cells of frozen-stored human fetal pancreatic tissue was obtained by a two-step method utilizing high concentrations of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Human fetal pancreata (14-23-week gestation) obtained from pathologic abortions were teased and cultured overnight. Prior to freezing the tissues were immersed in 0.9% saline containing 0.5 M DMSO for 30 min (room temperature) and then placed in 2.1 M DMSO on ice for 5 min. The tissues were frozen by the method previously developed in our laboratory and stored at -196 degrees C. The frozen-stored tissues were subsequently thawed at 24 degrees C and cultured overnight before viability testing. Viability and function of the B cells were assessed by several specific assay methods; glucose plus theophylline-induced insulin release during static incubation and perifusion, 3H-leucine incorporation into insulin, and insulin content of the tissue grown in athymic mice for 7 days. The response to glucose plus theophylline stimulation, measured on the frozen-thawed tissue one day after thawing, was 80% of the level measured in control tissue maintained in organ culture. Frozen-thawed tissues maintained in organ culture for 1 week responded comparably in the in vitro assay systems. The insulin content of frozen-thawed pancreatic tissue removed from athymic mice 1 week after transplantation was approximately 60% of the amount measured in the control grafts. These results demonstrate the utility of our procedure in the maintenance of the viability and function of frozen-stored human B cells both in culture and after transplantation."
7805735	"Leaf age alters the balance between the use of end-product of plastidic isoprenoid synthesis pathway, dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMADP), in prenyltransferase reactions leading to synthesis of pigments of photosynthetic machinery and in isoprene synthesis, but the implications of such changes on environmental responses of isoprene emission have not been studied. Because under light-limited conditions, isoprene emission rate is controlled by DMADP pool size (SDMADP ), shifts in the share of different processes are expected to particularly strongly alter the light dependency of isoprene emission. We examined light responses of isoprene emission in young fully expanded, mature and old non-senescent leaves of hybrid aspen (Populus tremula x P. tremuloides) and estimated in vivo SDMADP and isoprene synthase activity from post-illumination isoprene release. Isoprene emission capacity was 1.5-fold larger in mature than in young and old leaves. The initial quantum yield of isoprene emission (αI ) increased by 2.5-fold with increasing leaf age primarily as the result of increasing SDMADP . The saturating light intensity (QI90 ) decreased by 2.3-fold with increasing leaf age, and this mainly reflected limited light-dependent increase of SDMADP possibly due to feedback inhibition by DMADP. These major age-dependent changes in the shape of the light response need consideration in modelling canopy isoprene emission."
6859427	"Organ transplants are not regarded as an exclusively medical process, because they involve financial, religious, philosophic, and bioethical parameters. It becomes clear that if they are to achieve their purpose, which we believe extends well beyond the medical dimension, the creation of a comprehensive framework of communication between the involved parties is of paramount importance. The aim of this paper is to present an outline and a number of considerations regarding the communicational, bioethical, and legal issues that arise from a rather dramatic state of affairs in Greece today: In 2012 the rate of organ transplants stood at only 7 per 1 million of the population. The outdated legal framework and the lack of trust on the part of patients and the public have led to a highly inefficient system that is lagging behind in many respects. The proposition made in this paper is that there is a need for a new system of communication between doctors, patients, relatives of patients, and hospitals: bioethical mediation. This is a system that has played a vital role and has produced astounding results in other countries. There is also every indication that the introduction of such a system is crucial for Greece, especially as the symptoms of the acute financial crisis are become fully visible and tangible. Mediation aims to identify solutions that are oriented toward the interests and wishes of patients, are acknowledged and accepted by all parties involved, and are in tune with the values and the principles of medical practice."
6929712	"Hepatitis B virus reinfection as well as recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma are frequent complications in liver allograft recipients. This is the report of a patient who had two liver transplantations with a 6-year interval, both for the same indication-postnecrotic cirrhosis and liver cancer. Following first and second transplantation, hepatitis B reinfection occurred at 12 and 6 months, and allograft cirrhosis developed after 20 and 10 months, respectively. Intrahepatic recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma was found after 69 months. Two years following retransplantation, the patient is tumor-free, and has normal graft function. In selected patients with hepatitis B-related liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma liver replacement is indicated when combined with effective immunoprophylaxis, and other adjuvant therapy. Late recurrence of both diseases is unusual, and retransplantation may come into question."
9062156	"The mechanisms controlling progression of glomerulonephritis are poorly understood, but there is increasing evidence that tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) plays a central role in many aspects of glomerular inflammation and scarring. We investigated the role of TNF-alpha in an experimental model of crescentic glomerulonephritis in Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats by continuously blocking endogenous TNF-alpha, using its soluble receptor sTNFr p55, both before and after establishment of nephritis.                                                                              Glomerulonephritis was induced by a single intravenous injection of 0.1 ml nephrotoxic serum. In the first experiment, rats were pre-treated with sTNFr p55 2 mg/kg intraperitoneally 1 hour before induction of nephritis and on a daily basis thereafter until day 4. In the second experiment, a similar protocol was followed, but treatment with sTNFr p55 was continued until day 10. In the third experiment, treatment with sTNFr p55 was delayed until 4 days after induction of nephritis and continued until day 10. The effects of treatment on renal function, renal histology, cellular infiltration, activation and proliferation, and IL-1beta expression were assessed by standard methods.                                                                              In the first experiment, short-term treatment with sTNFr p55 caused a marked reduction in albuminuria and fibrinoid necrosis. It also reduced glomerular cell infiltration, activation and proliferation. In the second experiment, prolonged treatment with sTNFr p55 caused a sustained reduction in albuminuria and all histological and cellular parameters of glomerular inflammation; in particular it completely prevented the development of crescents. In the third experiment, delayed therapy of established nephritis with sTNFr p55 significantly reduced albuminuria and glomerular inflammation, including the prevalence of crescent formation. In both long-term experiments, there was less glomerular expression of IL-1beta and lower serum concentrations of IL-beta in sTNFr p55-treated rats.                                                                                      This study shows that neutralization of endogenous TNF-alpha is effective in preventing acute glomerular inflammation and crescent formation, and in treating established disease, in a rat model of crescentic nephritis. These results may have therapeutic implications for human glomerulonephritis."
3734028	"Subsequent neoplasms (SN) after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) cause significant patient morbidity and mortality. Risks for specific SN types vary substantially, with particularly elevated risks for post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorders, myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia, and squamous cell malignancies. This document provides an overview of the current state of knowledge regarding SN after HCT and recommends priorities and approaches to overcome challenges and gaps in understanding. Numerous factors have been suggested to affect risk, including patient-related (eg, age), primary disease-related (eg, disease type, pre-HCT therapies), and HCT-related characteristics (eg, type and intensity of conditioning regimen, stem cell source, development of graft-versus-host disease). However, gaps in understanding remain for each of these risk factors, particularly for patients receiving HCT in the current era because of substantial advances in clinical transplantation practices. Additionally, the influence of nontransplantation-related risk factors (eg, germline genetic susceptibility, oncogenic viruses, lifestyle factors) is poorly understood. Clarification of the magnitude of SN risks and identification of etiologic factors will require large-scale, long-term, systematic follow-up of HCT survivors with detailed clinical data. Most investigations of the mechanisms of SN pathogenesis after HCT have focused on immune drivers. Expansion of our understanding in this area will require interdisciplinary laboratory collaborations utilizing measures of immune function and availability of archival tissue from SN diagnoses. Consensus-based recommendations for optimal preventive, screening, and therapeutic approaches have been developed for certain SN after HCT, whereas for other SN, general population guidelines are recommended. Further evidence is needed to specifically tailor preventive, screening, and therapeutic guidelines for SN after HCT, particularly for unique patient populations. Accomplishment of this broad research agenda will require increased investment in systematic data collection with engagement from patients, clinicians, and interdisciplinary scientists to reduce the burden of SN in the rapidly growing population of HCT survivors."
1324785	"Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) is a rare and severe type of drug eruption. Dihydrocodeine phosphate is a semisynthetic opioid analgesic. Recently, recessive mutations in IL36RN have been identified in generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP). To date, 4 cases of AGEP and IL36RN mutation without previous history of psoriasis vulgaris (PV) have been reported.                                                                                   A woman in her 60s with PV presented with diffuse erythema, nonfollicular pustules, and fever. She had been treated with dextromethorphan hydrobromide hydrate, amoxicillin hydrate, clarithromycin, dihydrocodeine phosphate, tipepidine hibenzate, and tulobuterol tape for a cough and common cold. Based on histopathologic results and a positive result in a drug provocation test with dihydrocodeine phosphate, she was diagnosed with AGEP. A heterozygous IL36RN mutation c.28C>   T (p.Arg10X) was also confirmed by mutation analysis.                                                                                                    This is the first report of dihydrocodeine phosphate-induced AGEP. In this case, helper T cells, type 17, might have been activated because of morphine and underlying PV, followed by increased production of interleukin (IL) 36. However, because of the IL36RN mutation, IL-36 signaling was uncontrolled, which might have resulted in the occurrence of AGEP. An IL36RN mutation might underlie several different pustular skin eruptions, including AGEP and GPP, and further accumulation of patient data is required."
8475464	"The treatment of steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) remains a clinical challenge, for which no standard therapy exists. Alemtuzumab is a humanized anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that has been successfully used as part of conditioning regimens for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) to prevent GVHD. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of alemtuzumab in treating steroid-refractory aGVHD (>   or=grade II) following HSCT. Eighteen patients received subcutaneous alemtuzumab 10 mg daily on 5 consecutive days. Response was assessed at day 28 following initiation of alemtuzumab. Eight patients had grade II aGVHD, 8 had grade III, and 2 had grade IV. The main organ involved was the liver in 4 patients, gastrointestinal (GI) tract in 5, skin in 3, skin and liver in 3, and skin and GI tract in 3. Fifteen patients (83%) responded to alemtuzumab, including 6 (33%) with complete response. All 3 unresponsive patients died of GVHD. Ten of 15 responders are alive at median follow-up of 11 months (range: 3-24). Infections occurred in 14 patients, including cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation in 11. Grade 3 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 6 and 4 patients, respectively. Alemtuzumab was well tolerated, and induces promising response rates in steroid-refractory aGVHD."
1283828	"The relative contribution of the high-affinity K(+) transporter AtHAK5 and the inward rectifier K(+) channel AtAKT1 to K(+) uptake in the high-affinity range of concentrations was studied in Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia (Col-0). The results obtained with wild-type lines, with T-DNA insertion in both genes and specific uptake inhibitors, show that AtHAK5 and AtAKT1 mediate the NH4+-sensitive and the Ba(2+)-sensitive components of uptake, respectively, and that they are the two major contributors to uptake in the high-affinity range of Rb(+) concentrations. Using Rb(+) as a K(+) analogue, it was shown that AtHAK5 mediates absorption at lower Rb(+) concentrations than AtAKT1 and depletes external Rb(+) to values around 1 muM. Factors such as the presence of K(+) or NH4+ during plant growth determine the relative contribution of each system. The presence of NH4+ in the growth solution inhibits the induction of AtHAK5 by K(+) starvation. In K(+)-starved plants grown without NH4+, both systems are operative, but when NH4+ is present in the growth solution, AtAKT1 is probably the only system mediating Rb(+) absorption, and the capacity of the roots to deplete Rb(+) is reduced."
6857439	"Forty-six rat liver transplants were performed to investigate the effectiveness of a simplified lactobionate solution containing histidine as a buffer (histidine-lactobionate solution) and to compare it with University of Wisconsin solution. This new solution is isoosmotic (320 mOsm/L) and has a higher sodium content and a lower potassium content (Na: 90 mEq/L, K: 45 mEq/L) than standard UW solution. Buffering capacity is increased by adding histidine (90 mM/L) together with KH2PO4 (20 mM/L) and is greater than that of Eurocollins solution or UW solution. Adenosine, insulin, hydroxyethyl starch, and dexamethasone that are included in UW solution are not included in the new solution. The 1-week survival rate of rats transplanted with livers preserved in this solutions at 4 degrees C was 85% (11/13) following 24-hr preservation and 33% (2/6) after 30-hr preservation. By contrast, UW solution gave only a 29% (5/17) survival rate after 24-hr preservation and 0% (0/6) survival after 30-hr preservation, demonstrating that this simplified UW solution with histidine is superior to UW solution in rat liver preservation. No rats (0/4) receiving livers preserved for 24 hr in Eurocollins solution survived. These findings show that the inclusion of histidine as a buffer dramatically improves the effectiveness of lactobionate-based preservation solutions and justify application in a large-animal model and subsequently in clinical liver transplantation."
4642745	"A systematic phytochemical investigation of the aerial parts of Abies georgei yielded nine new and 72 known compounds, including four monoterpenes, four sesquiterpenes, 25 flavonones, 14 lignans, and 34 other chemical constituents. The new compounds included two monoterpenes (1 and 2), two sesquiterpenes (3 and 4), three flavonones (5, 6, and 7), and two other components (8 and 9). Their chemical structures were established on the basis of various spectroscopic data. All the isolates were tested for antitumor and anti-inflammatory activities. The new compound 9,4'-dihydroxy-5,7-dimethoxy-8-methylchalcone (7) demonstrated a moderate antiproliferative effect on QGY-7703 tumor cells (IC (50)  = 17.6 µg/mL). The known compound isoferulaldehyde (67) exhibited the strongest inhibitory activity against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NO production in RAW 264.7 macrophages (IC (50) = 19.0 µg/mL). Abies georgei may be a significant source of beneficial pharmaceutical compounds."
3930203	"The small subunit (S) increases the catalytic efficiency of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (EC 4.1.1.39) by stabilizing the active sites generated by four large subunit (L) dimers. This stabilization appears to be due to an influence of S on the reaction intermediate 2,3-enediol, which is formed after the abstraction of a proton from the substrate ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate. We tested the functional significance of residues that are conserved among most species in the carboxy-terminal part of S and analyzed their influence on the kinetic parameters of Synechococcus holoenzymes. The replacements in S (F92S, Q99G, and P108L) resulted in catalytic activities ranging from 95 to 43% of wild type. The specificity factors for the three mutant enzymes were little affected (90-96% of wild type), but Km(CO2) values increased 0.5- to 2-fold. Mutant enzymes with replacements Q99G and P108L showed increased mis-protonation, relative to carboxylation, of the 2,3-enediol intermediate, forming 2 to 3 times more xylulose-1,5-bisphosphate per ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate utilized than wild-type or F92S enzymes. The results suggest that specific alterations of the L/S interfaces and of the hydrophobic core of S are transmitted to the active site by long-range interactions. S interactions with L may restrict the flexibility of active-site residues in L."

8460680	"The triple isotope composition (delta17O and delta18O) of dissolved O2 in the ocean and in ice cores was recently used to assess the primary productivity over broad spatial and temporal scales. However, assessment of the productivity with the aid of this method must rely on accurate measurements of the 17O/16O versus 18O/16O relationship in each of the main oxygen-producing and -consuming reactions. Data obtained here showed that cleavage of water in photosystem II did not fractionate oxygen isotopes; the delta18O and delta17O of the O2 evolved were essentially identical to those of the substrate water. The fractionation slopes for the oxygenase reaction of Rubisco and respiration were identical (0.518 +/- 0.001) and that of glycolate oxidation was 0.503 +/- 0.002. There was a considerable difference in the slopes of O2 photoreduction (the Mehler reaction) in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 (0.497 +/- 0.004) and that of pea (Pisum sativum) thylakoids (0.526 +/- 0.001). These values provided clear and independent evidence that the mechanism of O2 photoreduction differs between higher plants and cyanobacteria. We used our method to assess the magnitude of O2 photoreduction in cyanobacterial cells maintained under conditions where photorespiration was negligible. It was found that electron flow to O2 can be as high as 40% that leaving photosystem II, whereas respiratory activity in the light is only 6%. The implications of our findings to the evaluation of specific O2-producing or -consuming reactions, in vivo, are discussed."
5621232	"Propylene Glycol-Free melphalan HCL for Injection (PGF-Mel) is a new formulation that incorporates Captisol, a specially modified cyclodextrin, to improve melphalan stability. In this phase IIa, open-label, randomized, cross-over design bioequivalence study, the pharmacokinetics of PGF-Mel were compared with the marketed formulation of melphalan, or Alkeran. Patients received half of the total dose of melphalan in the form of Alkeran and the other half in the form of PGF-Mel in an alternating manner. The pharmacokinetic measures were determined using WinNonlin 6.2 and bioequivalence was assessed using log-transformed systemic exposure parameters. Twenty-four patients, 11 females and 13 males, were enrolled between 4 February 2010 and 16 May 2011 at The University of Kansas Medical Center and The University of Kansas Cancer Center. The median age of enrolled subjects was 58 years (range: 48-65). All patients achieved myeloablation 3 days post autologous graft followed by successful neutrophil engraftment with a median of 11 days after transplant. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that PGF-Mel was bioequivalent with Alkeran and also revealed that maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) were higher (~10%) after PGF-Mel administration. In conclusion, PGF-Mel is considered bioequivalent to Alkeran while also demonstrating a marginally higher systemic drug exposure."
5145170	"Skin-infiltrating T cells play a predominant role in allergic and inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis. These T cells are attracted by chemotactic factors, e.g. RANTES (regulation on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted; CCL5), TARC (thymus and activation regulated chemokine; CCL17) and CTACK (cutaneous T-cell attracting chemokine; CCL27).                                                                                   To investigate which T-cell-attracting chemokines are involved in allergic contact dermatitis in mice.                                                                              Allergic contact dermatitis was induced by application of dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) or toluene-2,4-diisocyanate (TDI), and chemokine concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The effects on chemokine concentrations of the highly selective phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor cilomilast and the glucocorticoid diflorasone diacetate were studied in mouse ears.                                                                              RANTES and TARC were elevated in both models of allergic contact dermatitis 24 h after challenge, whereas CTACK remained unchanged. The increase in RANTES was diminished in mouse ears pretreated with cilomilast or diflorasone diacetate. TARC was reduced by diflorasone diacetate in the DNCB model but was highly induced in the TDI model; in contrast, TARC was not influenced by cilomilast.                                                                                      TARC and RANTES, but not CTACK, are involved in these two models of allergic contact dermatitis."
4762648	"An experimental transplantation model using human fetal skin was applied to approach the question of the embryologic origin of human Merkel cells. Palmar and plantar skin from five fetuses, between 8 and 11 weeks of estimated gestational age (EGA), was xenografted to subcutaneous beds of nude mice. After 4 or 8 weeks of growth, biopsies were taken from these xenografts and examined for the presence of Merkel cells, using immunocytochemistry with antibodies specific for simple epithelial-type cytokeratins and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) as well as using electron microscopy. Skin from the same fetuses at the time of transplantation was screened in the same way. In all fetuses, no (or very scarce) epidermal Merkel cells were detected at the transplantation time, but in all cases abundant epidermal Merkel cells of apparent human origin were found after 4 or 8 weeks in xenograft culture. Dermal nerve fibers, as recognized by neurofilament antibodies, were scarce or essentially absent in the xenografts. These results indicate that Merkel cells regularly develop in epidermis dissected and xenografted in an early fetal stage, although the dissection implies the interruption of the dermal nerves. The results strongly support the notion of the origin of Merkel cells from epidermal precursor cells. The apparent absence of dermal Merkel cells and dermal nerve fibers in the xenografts suggests that the presence of dermal sensory nerve fibers may be required for the dropping off of epidermal Merkel cells into the upper dermis, which occurs in normal fetal development."
9055356	"The root stem cell niche, which in the Arabidopsis thaliana root meristem is an area of four mitotically inactive quiescent cells (QCs) and the surrounding mitotically active stem cells, is critical for root development and growth. We report here that during jasmonate-induced inhibition of primary root growth, jasmonate reduces root meristem activity and leads to irregular QC division and columella stem cell differentiation. Consistently, jasmonate reduces the expression levels of the AP2-domain transcription factors PLETHORA1 (PLT1) and PLT2, which form a developmentally instructive protein gradient and mediate auxin-induced regulation of stem cell niche maintenance. Not surprisingly, the effects of jasmonate on root stem cell niche maintenance and PLT expression require the functioning of MYC2/JASMONATE INSENSITIVE1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that involves versatile aspects of jasmonate-regulated gene expression. Gel shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments reveal that MYC2 directly binds the promoters of PLT1 and PLT2 and represses their expression. We propose that MYC2-mediated repression of PLT expression integrates jasmonate action into the auxin pathway in regulating root meristem activity and stem cell niche maintenance. This study illustrates a molecular framework for jasmonate-induced inhibition of root growth through interaction with the growth regulator auxin."
1263977	"Heterosis describes the superior performance of heterozygous hybrid plants over their homozygous parental inbred lines. Despite the rediscovery of this phenomenon a century ago and its paramount agronomic importance, the genetic and molecular basis of heterosis remains enigmatic. Recently, various pioneer studies described differences in genome organization and gene expression of hybrids and their parental inbred lines. At the genomic level, a significant loss of colinearity at many loci between different inbred lines of maize was observed. At the level of gene expression, complex transcriptional networks specific for different developmental stages and tissues were monitored in maize (Zea mays), rice (Oryza sativa) and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Integration of this complex expression data might contribute to improve our understanding of the molecular basis of heterosis."
8381410	"Scientific inquiries in fields ranging from ecology to plant breeding assess phenotypic variation within a plant species either to explain its presence or utilize its consequences. Frequently this natural genetic variation is studied via mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs); however, elucidation of the underlying molecular mechanisms is a continuing bottleneck. The genomic analysis of transcripts as individual phenotypes has led to the emerging field of expression QTL analysis. This field has begun both to delve into the ecological/evolutionary significance of this transcript variation as well as to use specific eQTLs to speed up our analysis of the molecular basis of quantitative traits. This review introduces eQTL analysis and begins to illustrate how these data can be applied to multiple research fields."
7202469	"Erosive pustular dermatosis of the leg is a distinct form of spongiform amicrobial pustulosis. The disorder typically affects the lower limbs of elderly patients presenting with chronic venous insufficiency and stasis dermatitis, and has a chronic course. Three elderly patients with chronic venous ulcers are described, who developed pustules and moist eroded lesions on the leg. The clinical and histological features were typical for erosive pustular dermatosis. The lesions rapidly responded to topical treatment with either tacrolimus or corticosteroids. Of note, this condition was associated with a diverticular disease in two patients, while in another patient an epidermoid carcinoma of the tongue was present. Erosive pustular dermatosis of the leg is an uncommon but distinct skin disorder typically associated with trophic changes of the lower limbs. Our observations raise the question of the relation of erosive pustular dermatosis of the leg with the group of neutrophilic dermatoses. Topical immunotherapy with tacrolimus may constitute a novel therapeutic option for this frequently recalcitrant condition."
3041556	"Hemin, a heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) inducer, was shown to exert numerous beneficial physiological functions in animals. Our previous study suggests that HO-1/carbon monoxide (CO) acts as a novel downstream signal system in the auxin-induced adventitious rooting. The objective of this study was to test whether nitric oxide (NO) is involved in hemin-induced cucumber adventitious rooting. Applications of hemin or CO aqueous solution to auxin-depleted cucumber explant induced up-regulation of cucumber HO-1 transcripts (CsHO1), NO production, and thereafter adventitious root formation, and some above responses were blocked by the combination treatment with two nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-like enzyme inhibitors N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methylester hydrochloride and N(G)-nitro-L-arginine, a HO-1 specific inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin IX, and a specific NO scavenger 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide potassium salt. However, these blocking responses were not observed using tungstate, an inhibitor of nitrate reductase, another NO producing enzyme in plants. Furthermore, the guanylate cyclase inhibitors 1H-(1,2,4)-oxadiazole[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one and 6-anilino-5,8-quinolinedione reduced root development induced by hemin, whereas the cell-permeable cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) derivative 8-Br-cGMP reversed this effect. Together, our results indicated that at least in our experimental conditions, NO might operate downstream of hemin promoting adventitious root formation probably in a cGMP-dependent manner."
3035255	"Three hundred thirty-two marrow graft recipients and 241 healthy marrow donors were studied by skin testing with recall and neoantigens. Two hundred thirty patients with leukemia and seventy-eight patients with aplastic anemia received allogeneic HLA-identical sibling marrow. Twenty-four patients with leukemia received syngeneic marrow. The conditioning regimen prior to marrow infusion consisted of 120 mg/kg cyclophosphamide and 9.2-15.75 Gy total-body irradiation (leukemia) or 200 mg/kg cyclophosphamide (aplastic anemia). The patients were skin-tested with the neoantigens dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB), keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and a battery of five recall antigens around 100, 150, 365, 730, 1095, 1460, and 1825 days after grafting. A binary logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the factors thought to influence immunocompetence. At 3 months postgrafting, the proportion of patients positive to DNCB was equal to that of normal marrow donors, but thereafter it was lower until 2 years. The proportion of patients positive to keyhole limpet hemocyanin was lower than normal regardless of the time after grafting. The proportion of patients positive to recall antigens was lower than that of normal marrow donors until 4 years after grafting. Patients with a history of acute graft-versus-host disease had the lowest probability of a positive reaction to recall antigens. None of the other factors was significantly associated with an increased or reduced level of response."

4581782	"Recent studies have demonstrated that a tanning lamp emitting predominantly ultraviolet (UV) A induces significant yields of the type of potentially mutagenic DNA damage that are associated with the onset of skin cancer (i.e. cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers). UV-induced immunosuppression is also an important event leading to skin cancer.                                                                                   To the modulation of key immunological molecules following exposure to a broad-spectrum UVB lamp and a predominantly UVA-emitting tanning lamp using model in vitro systems.                                                                              We compared secretion and mRNA expression of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in normal human epidermal keratinocytes, and interferon (IFN)-gamma-induced intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 in normal human fibroblasts irradiated in vitro with a broad-spectrum UVB lamp or with a Philips 'Performance' tanning lamp.                                                                              With broad-spectrum UVB irradiation, upregulation of IL-6 and TNF-alpha mRNA was detected 6 h after irradiation, and a dose-dependent increase of cytokines in the supernatants of irradiated cells was found 24 h after irradiation. In contrast, there was no cytokine secretion and little evidence for mRNA upregulation following exposure to a tanning lamp. When cells were exposed first to broad-spectrum UVB, then the tanning lamp, UVB-induced cytokine secretion was inhibited, although mRNA levels were upregulated to a level close to that observed with UVB alone. By using a Schott WG 320 nm filter to attenuate the level of UVB relative to UVA emitted by the tanning lamp, the inhibition of cytokine secretion was shown to be associated with UVA exposure. Both UV sources inhibited IFN-gamma-induced ICAM-1 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent fashion. By using a Schott WG 335 nm filter, inhibition of ICAM-1 mRNA expression by the tanning lamp was shown to be associated with UVB exposure.                                                                                      These results suggest that UV sources emitting different levels of UVA and UVB have differential effects on the modulation of different immunoregulatory molecules, and indicate that there are potential interactions between these wavelengths."
4244577	"Signaling pathways, specifically calcium and calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK), have been implicated in the regulation of stress and developmental signals in plants. Here, we reported the isolation and characterization of an orchid, Phalaenopsis amabilis, CDPK gene, PaCDPK1, by using the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)-PCR technique. The full length cDNA of 2,310 bp contained an open reading frame for PaCDPK1 consisting of 593 amino acid residues. Sequence alignment indicated that PaCDPK1 shared similarities with other plant CDPKs. PaCDPK1 transcripts were expressed strongly in labellum but not in leaves and roots. In addition, the PaCDPK1 gene was transcriptionally activated in response to low temperature, wounding, and pathogen infection. To identify the regulatory role of the PaCDPK1 promoter, a construct containing the PaCDPK1 promoter fused to a beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene was transferred into Arabidopsis by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. GUS staining revealed that PaCDPK1/GUS expression was induced by cold, wounding, and pathogen challenge in leaves and stems of transgenic Arabidopsis. These results suggested that this PaCDPK1 gene promoter could be used as an endogenous promoter for biotechnological purposes in orchids."
3556617	"Oxidative stress may play an important role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) make up a group of antioxidant enzymes. Cytochrome p450 (CYP) enzymes can influence oxidation and reduction reactions. We investigated the potential effects of GST and CYP enzymes in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. The study included 32 psoriasis patients and 22 healthy subjects. Psoriasis patients were administered 20 sessions of narrowband ultraviolet B phototherapy. Expressions of GST and CYP enzymes were assessed by immunohistochemical staining. Expression levels of GSTK1, GSTM1, and GSTT1 were significantly higher in psoriasis than in control tissues (P = 0.022, P = 0.001, and P = 0.006, respectively). Pre- and post-treatment expression was similar. Expression of CYP1A1 and CYP2E1 was significantly higher in pre- (P = 0.003 and P = 0.001, respectively) and post-treatment (P = 0.003 and P = 0.001, respectively) psoriatic tissues than in control tissues. No significant differences in CYP1B1 levels between the study and control groups were detected before treatment (P >    0.05). However, CYP1B1 levels were higher in post-treatment psoriatic tissue than in control tissue (P = 0.045). The significant increases in expression of GSTK1, GSTM1, and GSTT1 in psoriasis may reflect the increased activation of GST in response to excessive free radical formation from activated neutrophils or ultraviolet exposure to maintain antioxidant capacity in psoriasis. Furthermore, expressions of CYP1A1 and CYP2E1 represent important enzymatic systems in psoriasis. These findings suggest that psoriasis is an oxidative stress condition, although phototherapy does not affect these enzymatic systems. Further investigation is required."
5613887	"The peripheral nervous system, in addition to its sensory and motor functions, can induce a local inflammatory response known as neurogenic inflammation. This phenomenon plays a critical role in several inflammatory diseases, e.g., asthma, atopy, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and ulcerative colitis. Neurogenic inflammation and the role of nerve growth factor (NGF) have been extensively studied in psoriasis. There are increased levels of NGF in the keratinocytes and upregulation of NGF receptor (NGF-R) in the cutaneous nerves of psoriatic plaques. NGF can influence all the salient pathologic events noticed in psoriasis such as proliferation of keratinocytes, angiogenesis, T cell activation, expression of adhesion molecules, proliferation of cutaneous nerves, and upregulation of neuropeptides. In this double-blinded, placebo-controlled study, we addressed the role of NGF/NGF-R in psoriasis in an in vivo system using the severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mouse-human skin model of psoriasis. The transplanted psoriatic plaques on the SCID mice (n=12) were treated with K252a, a high-affinity NGF receptor blocker. Psoriasis significantly improved following 2 wk of therapy. The length of the rete pegs changed from 308.57+/-98.72 to 164.64+/-46.78 microm (p<   0.01, Student's t test). A similar improvement of psoriasis was observed by directly inhibiting NGF with NGF-neutralizing antibody. NGF-neutralizing antibody in normal saline at 10 ng (n=4) and 20 ng (n=4) per kilogram of body weight doses were used. Both doses of NGF-neutralizing antibody reduced rete peg lengths significantly, e.g., from 298.5+/-42.69 to 150.52+/-32.93 microm (p<   0.05, Student's t test). This study provides evidence for the role of NGF and its high-affinity receptor in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and insights to develop novel therapeutic modalities."
8961024	"Microfocused ultrasound (MFU) has been recently developed to meet the ever-growing public demand for achieving significant, noninvasive skin lifting and tightening. MFU can be focused on subcutaneous tissue where the temperature briefly reaches greater than 60°C, producing small (<   1 mm(3)) thermal coagulation points to a depth of up to 5 mm within the mid-to-deep reticular layer of the dermis and subdermis. The intervening papillary dermal and epidermal layers of skin remain unaffected. The application of heat at these discrete thermal coagulation points causes collagen fibers in the facial planes such as the superficial musculoaponeurotic system and platysma, as well as the deep reticular dermis, to become denatured, contracting and stimulating de novo collagen. A commercially available device combines MFU with high-resolution ultrasound imaging (MFU-V), which enables visualization of tissue planes to a depth of 8 mm and allows the user to see where the MFU energy will be applied (Ultherapy(®); Ulthera Inc., Mesa, AZ, USA). Using different transducers, MFU-V treatment can be customized to meet the unique physical characteristics of each patient by adjusting energy and focal depth of the emitted ultrasound. By targeting the facial superficial musculoaponeurotic system, noninvasive tightening and lifting of sagging facial and neck skin and improvements in the appearance of wrinkles can be achieved. MFU-V can also improve lines and wrinkles of the décolleté. Treatment protocols for the use of MFU-V continue to be refined, and its use in combination with other rejuvenation techniques has been demonstrated. Brief discomfort that often occurs during treatment can be minimized with oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Other treatment-related adverse events include transient erythema, edema, and occasional bruising. MFU-V is best suited for patients with mild-to-moderate skin and soft tissue laxity. For older patients with severe skin laxity and marked platysmal banding, surgical treatment should be considered."
9886341	"In past studies, it was hypothesized that reductions in chloroplast isoprene emissions at high atmospheric CO(2) concentrations were caused by competition between cytosolic and mitochondrial processes for the same substrate, possibly phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). We conducted field and laboratory experiments using leaves of white poplar (Populus alba L.) to identify whether an inverse relationship occurs between the dark respiration rate (a mitochondrial process) and the isoprene emission rate. Field experiments that were carried out in a free-air CO(2)-enriched (FACE) facility showed no clear effect of elevated CO(2) on either isoprene emission rate or respiration rate by leaves. In young, not yet fully expanded leaves, low isoprene emission and high dark respiration rates were measured in both ambient and elevated CO(2). In these leaves, isoprene emission was inversely correlated with dark respiration. It is possible to interpret from these results that, in young leaves, high rates of growth respiration compete with isoprene biosynthesis for the same substrate. However, it is also possible that the negative correlation reflects the contrasting reductions in growth respiration and increases in expression of the enzyme isoprene synthase at this final stage of leaf maturation. In contrast to our observations on young leaves, respiration rate and isoprene emission rate were positively correlated in older, fully expanded leaves (8 and 11 from apex). A positive correlation was also found between respiration rate and isoprene emission rate when these parameters were modulated using different ozone exposure, growth light intensity, growth temperature and exposure to different leaf temperatures in laboratory experiments. These data show that competition for substrate between isoprene biosynthesis and leaf respiration does not determine the rate of isoprene emission in most circumstances that affect both processes. A negative correlation was observed across all experiments between isoprene emission rate and the activity of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPc), a cytosolic enzyme that competes with isoprene biosynthesis for substrate. The cytosolic metabolite, PEP, occurs at a metabolic branch point from which substrate flows into three processes: (1) the production of pyruvate for mitochondrial respiration, (2) the production of oxaloacetate (OAA) by PEPc for anabolic support of mitochondrial respiration and (3) transport into the chloroplast to support chloroplastic demands for pyruvate, including isoprenoid biosynthesis. The results of our observations suggest that only the second process competes for substrate with isoprenoid synthesis, while the partitioning of PEP between mitochondrial respiration and chloroplast isoprenoid biosynthesis is controlled in a way that retains balance in substrate demand."
7118155	"Grafting, an old plant propagation practice, is still widely used with fruit trees and in recent decades also with vegetables. Taxonomic proximity is a general prerequisite for successful graft-take and long-term survival of the grafted, composite plant. However, the mechanisms underlying interspecific graft incompatibility are as yet insufficiently understood. Hormonal signals, auxin in particular, are believed to play an important role in the wound healing and vascular regeneration within the graft union zone. Incomplete and convoluted vascular connections impede the vital upward and downward whole plant transfer routes. Long-distance protein, mRNA and small RNA graft-transmissible signals currently emerge as novel mechanisms which regulate nutritional and developmental root/top relations and may play a pivotal role in grafting physiology. Grafting also has significant pathogenic projections. On one hand, stock to scion mechanical contact enables the spread of diseases, even without a complete graft union. But, on the other hand, grafting onto resistant rootstocks serves as a principal tool in the management of fruit tree plagues and vegetable soil-borne diseases. The 'graft hybrid' historic controversy has not yet been resolved. Recent evidence suggests that epigenetic modification of DNA-methylation patterns may account for certain graft-transformation phenomena. Root grafting is a wide spread natural phenomenon; both intraspecific and interspecific root grafts have been recorded. Root grafts have an evolutionary role in the survival of storm-hit forest stands as well as in the spread of devastating diseases. A more fundamental evolutionary role is hinted by recent findings that demonstrate plastid and nuclear genome transfer between distinct Nicotiana species in the graft union zone, within a tissue culture system. This has led to the formation of alloploid cells that, under laboratory conditions, gave rise to a novel, alloploid Nicotiana species, indicating that natural grafts may play a role in plant speciation, under certain circumstances."
6172532	"In summary, a wide variety of skin care products contain preservatives. Patients who are allergic to one of these preservatives may have either localized or widespread dermatitis. Affected patients may find it difficult to avoid thimerosal without the help of the health care provider because the use of these allergens is so widespread. Patch testing is an invaluable tool for patients who struggle with dermatitis. Antigen-avoidance lists that facilitate patient education about what products to avoid are available from the manufacturers of patch test allergens (for example, TRUE Test or Chemotechnique). These lists are helpful starting points for patients in that they provide general categories (for example, shampoos, soaps, or creams) of products that the patient should avoid. With these printed guidelines alone, patients must read skin care product labels carefully, looking for the names of their allergens as identified by patch tests as well as for any synonyms and cross-reactors of these allergens. Thus, patients may feel overwhelmed by hearing the names of allergens that are long and complex. After an allergen has been identified, the nurse can play a key role in helping patients understand their dermatitis and its management. Nurses are in a unique position to spend time educating patients about how to uncover the sources of specific allergens and, subsequently, how to avoid them. The Contact Allergen Replacement Database can help in this educational process by giving patients a shopping list of specific items that are free of the specific allergens causing their allergic contact dermatitis."
8027911	"An easy and non-invasive method for measuring plant cold tolerance is highly valuable to instigate research targeting breeding of cold tolerant crops. Traditional methods are labor intensive, time-consuming and thereby of limited value for large scale screening. Here, we have tested the capacity of chlorophyll a fluorescence (ChlF) imaging based methods for the first time on intact whole plants and employed advanced statistical classifiers and feature selection rules for finding combinations of images able to discriminate cold tolerant and cold sensitive plants.                                                                              ChlF emission from intact whole plant rosettes of nine Arabidopsis thaliana accessions was measured for (1) non-acclimated (NAC, six week old plants grown at room temperature), (2) cold acclimated (AC, NAC plants acclimated at 4°C for two weeks), and (3) sub-zero temperature (ST) treated (STT, AC plants treated at -4°C for 8 h in dark) states. Cold acclimation broadened the slow phase of ChlF transients in cold sensitive (Co, C24, Can and Cvi) A. thaliana accessions. Similar broadening in the slow phase of ChlF transients was observed in cold tolerant (Col, Rsch, and Te) plants following ST treatments. ChlF parameters: maximum quantum yield of PSII photochemistry (FV/FM) and fluorescence decrease ratio (RFD) well categorized the cold sensitive and tolerant plants when measured in STT state. We trained a range of statistical classifiers with the sequence of captured ChlF images and selected a high performing quadratic discriminant classifier (QDC) in combination with sequential forward floating selection (SFFS) feature selection methods and found that linear combination of three images showed a reasonable contrast between cold sensitive and tolerant A. thaliana accessions for AC as well as for STT states.                                                                                      ChlF transients measured for an intact whole plant is important for understanding the impact of cold acclimation on photosynthetic processes. Combinatorial imaging combined with statistical classifiers and feature selection methods worked well for the screening of cold tolerance without exposing plants to sub-zero temperatures. This opens up new possibilities for high-throughput monitoring of whole plants cold tolerance via easy and fully non-invasive means."
7869577	"Apple (Malus x domestica Borkh.) is a model species for studying the metabolic changes that occur at the onset of ripening in fruit crops, and the physiological mechanisms that are governed by the hormone ethylene. In this study, to dissect the climacteric interplay in apple, a multidisciplinary approach was employed. To this end, a comprehensive analysis of gene expression together with the investigation of several physiological entities (texture, volatilome and content of polyphenolic compounds) was performed throughout fruit development and ripening. The transcriptomic profiling was conducted with two microarray platforms: a dedicated custom array (iRIPE) and a whole genome array specifically enriched with ripening-related genes for apple (WGAA). The transcriptomic and phenotypic changes following the application of 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), an ethylene inhibitor leading to important modifications in overall fruit physiology, were also highlighted. The integrative comparative network analysis showed both negative and positive correlations between ripening-related transcripts and the accumulation of specific metabolites or texture components. The ripening distortion caused by the inhibition of ethylene perception, in addition to affecting the ethylene pathway, stimulated the de-repression of auxin-related genes, transcription factors and photosynthetic genes. Overall, the comprehensive repertoire of results obtained here advances the elucidation of the multi-layered climacteric mechanism of fruit ripening, thus suggesting a possible transcriptional circuit governed by hormones and transcription factors."

Early detection and treatment of PsA could contribute to the prevention of clinical and radiological progression.                                                                                   To analyse the predictive value of clinical and patient-reported outcomes for concomitant PsA in a population-based cohort of patients with psoriasis.                                                                              We performed a retrospective analysis of data from three independent national cross-sectional studies on health care in psoriasis and PsA, conducted in Germany in the years 2005, 2007 and 2008. Patients with psoriasis were included in the study by dermatologists (n = 3520) and via the German patient advocacy group for psoriasis (n = 2449). In all studies, psoriasis history, clinical findings, PsA, nail involvement, health care and patient-reported outcomes were collected with standardized questionnaires.                                                                              In the regression model on 4146 patients the strongest predictors for concomitant PsA were nail involvement [odds ratio (OR) 2·93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2·51-3·42, P <    0·001] and inpatient hospital treatment (OR 1·63, 95% CI 1·38-1·93, P <    0·001). By contrast, scalp involvement was not a significant predictor.                                                                                      Patients with psoriasis seen by dermatologists and those in patient advocacy groups show clinical indicators of PsA, the most predictive being nail disease. In practice, a comprehensive assessment of clinical findings associated with PsA is needed."
6452984	"Haemophagocytic syndrome is a systemic clinicopathological entity characterized by systemic proliferation of benign haemophagocytic histiocytes, fever, cytopenia, abnormal liver function and, frequently, coagulopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. Its occurrence has been documented in association with viral, bacterial, fungal and parasitic infections, a wide spectrum of malignant neoplasms, autoimmune diseases and drugs. We report a case of rubella virus-associated haemophagocytic syndrome in a previously healthy 29-year-old woman. Blood tests showed cytopenia, especially severe thrombocytopenia, liver dysfunction, hyperferritinaemia and hypercytokinaemia. Bone marrow examination showed many mature histiocytes with active haemophagocytosis. A skin biopsy from the rash revealed perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltrates with haemophagocytic histiocytes in the upper and mid-dermis. The patient was treated with antibiotics and immunoglobulin, and by supportive measures including platelet transfusion, and recovered completely."
9800323	"This study was designed to determine the cause of posttransplantation hepatitis in patients undergoing transplantation for liver disease of nonviral cause; the role of acquired hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatitis G virus (HGV) in posttransplantation hepatitis; and the course of posttransplantation hepatitis of unknown cause. Two hundred forty-three patients underwent transplantation for nonviral liver diseases (mean age, 48 years; 103 men, 140 women). Serological and virological assays for HBV and HCV were performed pretransplantation to exclude preexisting infection and posttransplantation to investigate the cause of posttransplantation hepatitis. Histology was graded on all available biopsy specimens; posttransplantation hepatitis was assessable in 150 patients. Posttransplantation hepatitis was present in 29% (44 of 150) of the patients after a median follow-up of 47 months (range, 1 to 101 months). Actuarial survival was significantly lower in patients with posttransplantation hepatitis compared with patients without (71% v 89% at 5-year follow-up; P = .03). HCV and HBV were identified posttransplantation in 14% and 9% of patients with hepatitis, respectively. After the exclusion of HCV and HBV infection, 22% (33 of 150) of the patients had posttransplantation hepatitis of unknown cause. HGV was present in 58% of these patients, but HGV was equally prevalent in patients without posttransplantation hepatitis. When patients with HBV and HCV were excluded, there was no difference in survival between patients with posttransplantation hepatitis compared with patients without (P = .08, log-rank test). Posttransplantation hepatitis was present in approximately 30% of the patients undergoing transplantation for nonviral diseases, with a median follow-up of 47 months. Known hepatitis viruses (HBV, HCV) were present in one fourth of the patients with posttransplantation hepatitis; 22% (33 of 150) of the patients had hepatitis of unknown cause, suggesting that other, as yet undiscovered, hepatitis viruses may exist."
5647976	"Topical tretinoin has been a standard treatment for acne vulgaris for more than 4 decades. While tretinoin has demonstrated proven efficacy in the treatment of acne lesions, it also is associated with the potential for skin irritation. Newer formulations have been designed to optimize both the drug concentration and the delivery vehicle with the aim to enable clinicians to provide increasingly effective acne treatment that minimizes irritation. These therapies include formulations with varying concentrations of tretinoin and vehicles that utilize a microsponge delivery system, hydrogels and micronized tretinoin, or propolymers. The purpose of this review is to evaluate different formulations and combinations of tretinoin in the treatment of acne vulgaris. While these advanced formulations were designed for controlled release of active ingredient, and have the potential to reduce cutaneous irritation relative to standard tretinoin cream and gel formulations, there is a need for comparative studies to evaluate the relative benefits of each of these advanced tretinoin formulations in optimizing acne treatment."

Eighty-six patients with primary pyoderma, visiting the dermatology outpatient, were studied clinically and microbiologically. Sensitivity testing was done for vancomycin, sisomycin, gentamicin, framycetin, erythromycin, methicillin, cefazolin, cefuroxime, penicillin G and ciprofloxacin. Phage typing was done for MRSA positive strains.                                                                              The culture positivity rate was 83.7%. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in all cases except two. Barring one, all strains of Staphylococcus were sensitive to methicillin.                                                                                      Methicillin resistance is uncommon in community-acquired primary pyodermas in Mumbai. Treatment with antibacterials active against MRSA is probably unwarranted for community-acquired primary pyodermas."
4308227	Perioral dermatitis is a relatively important and often enigmatic type of eczema.                                                                              We describe a child with this disorder and review our experience and the literature.                                                                              Clinical features of perioral dermatitis in our patient and in many others described elsewhere show a high prevalence of perinasal and periocular involvement alongside perioral findings.                                                                                      Perioral dermatitis is more suitably termed periorificial dermatitis.
7485837	"Chemical mutagenesis is routinely used to create large numbers of rare mutations in plant and animal populations, which can be subsequently subjected to selection for beneficial traits and phenotypes that enable the characterization of gene functions. Several next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based target enrichment methods have been developed for the detection of mutations in target DNA regions. However, most of these methods aim to sequence a large number of target regions from a small number of individuals. Here, we demonstrate an effective and affordable strategy for the discovery of rare mutations in a large sodium azide-induced mutant rice population (F2 ). The integration of multiplex, semi-nested PCR combined with NGS library construction allowed for the amplification of multiple target DNA fragments for sequencing. The 8 × 8 × 8 tridimensional DNA sample pooling strategy enabled us to obtain DNA sequences of 512 individuals while only sequencing 24 samples. A stepwise filtering procedure was then elaborated to eliminate most of the false positives expected to arise through sequencing error, and the application of a simple Student's t-test against position-prone error allowed for the discovery of 16 mutations from 36 enriched targeted DNA fragments of 1024 mutagenized rice plants, all without any false calls."
4385355	"During their 6 month development, pear (Pyrus communis) fruits undergo drastic changes in their morphology and their chemical composition. To gain a better understanding of the metabolic pathways and transport processes active during fruit development, we performed a time-course analysis using mass spectrometry (MS)-based protein identification and quantification of fruit flesh tissues. After pre-fractionation of the samples, 2,841 proteins were identified. A principal component analysis (PCA) separated the samples from seven developmental stages into three distinct clusters representing the early, mid and late developmental phase. Over-representation analysis of proteins characteristic of each developmental phase revealed both expected and novel biological processes relevant at each phase. A high abundance of aquaporins was detected in samples from fruits in the cell expansion stage. We were able quantitatively to reconstruct basic metabolic pathways such as the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, which indicates sufficient coverage to reconstruct other metabolic pathways. Most of the enzymes that presumably contribute to sugar accumulation in pear fruits could be identified. Our data indicate that invertases do not play a major role in the sugar conversions in developing pear fruits. Rather, sucrose might be broken down by sucrose synthases. Further focusing on sugar transporters, we identified several putative sugar transporters from diverse families which showed developmental regulation. In conclusion, our data set comprehensively describes the proteome of developing pear fruits and provides novel insights about sugar accumulation as well as candidate genes for key reactions and transport steps."

2883831	"Patients travel worldwide to purchase kidneys. Transplant professionals can play a role in identifying kidney purchase. However, due to the tension between their rights and obligations, a lack of understanding and knowledge exists on how to prevent and report purchase. We present the results of a national survey that describes transplant professionals' experiences, attitudes, behaviors, conflicts of duties, legal knowledge and needs for guidelines toward patients who purchase kidneys abroad. Second, we clarify professionals' rights and obligations regarding organ purchase and propose actions that they can take to report purchase. Of the 100/241 (42%) professionals who treated patients who traveled to a country outside the European Union for a kidney transplant, 31 (31%) were certain that patients purchased kidneys. Sixty-five (65%) had suspicions that patients had bought kidneys. The majority reported a conflict of duties. Eighty percent reported a need for guidelines. Professionals can help prevent organ purchase by disclosing information about organ trafficking networks to law enforcement. Such disclosure can support the investigation and prosecution of networks. We offer key components for guidelines on disclosure of these networks."
3430271	"Sucrose transporters are crucial to carbon partitioning in higher plants. With their role in loading of sucrose into the phloem they control sucrose distribution throughout the whole plant and drive the osmotic flow system in the phloem. Recently, first insight was obtained on the coordination of sucrose transporter action with plant growth and development. The analysis of transgenic plants with reduced or enhanced expression of sucrose transporters helped to elucidate their physiological function and regulation in detail and connections to light and hormone signalling pathways were discovered. Whereas members of the SUT1 subfamily of sucrose transporters seem to be tightly controlled at the transcriptional and post-translational level in solanaceous plants, other family members show primarily post-transcriptional control of their mRNA stability. Post-translational regulation of sucrose transporters might be affected by direct protein-protein interactions or by recycling of sucrose transporters at the plasma membrane. A model is proposed showing cell-to-cell movement of both the SUT1 mRNA as well as the SUT1 protein via the desmotubule connecting companion cells where transcription of sucrose transporters occurs, and the neighbouring sieve elements. We provide an overview over sucrose transporter regulation in Solanum species at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational level with emphasis on the many old and new questions surrounding the topic and how they could be answered."
3419344	"Evidence of the short-term effect of bortezomib on donor-specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibody (DSA) removal capacity has emerged. However, no published data characterize the durability of DSA response. Here, we report the long-term DSA response results on renal transplant patients treated with bortezomib.                                                                              In this single-center study, 26 living-donor renal transplant patients with a positive level of de novo DSA were preemptively treated with bortezomib (1.3 mg/m × 4 doses). A total of 15 patients received bortezomib as part of a combination regimen; 11 received bortezomib alone. Weekly serial measurements of HLA antibody were noted before, during, and after treatment using single-antigen beads.                                                                              At a median follow-up of 25.8 months posttreatment, allograft function remained good in each of the patients. Following treatment, 96% of the patients achieved at least a partial response. Eighteen patients (69%) experienced a complete response followed by a period of DSA remission. Ten patients had DSA relapse after remission, at a median of 3.8 months. The remaining eight patients are still in remission at 14 months posttreatment (median). Patients with remission enjoyed better allograft functional stability than those who relapsed (P=0.023). After bortezomib therapy, the addition of a calcineurin inhibitor or mycophenolate mofetil was predictive for maintaining a DSA remission (hazard ratio 0.09, 95% confidence interval 0.01-0.76).                                                                                      Bortezomib therapy consistently provides reduction in DSA and in many a DSA remission may occur. However, sustaining remission is likely necessary to improve allograft stability."

We investigated whether acne and its severity affected psychological functioning in those who suffered from this disorder among Iranians.                                                                                            One hundred and six patients with acne vulgaris who consecutively attended the dermatology outpatient clinics in Semnan city in 2008 were included. Among them, 103 patients met the study's inclusion criterion and agreed to participate. One hundred and six age and gender cross-matched healthy volunteers were included as controls that attended the clinic with their diseased relatives. All acne patients were evaluated using the Symptom Check List-90 (SCL-90).                                                                              According to the American Academy of Dermatology classification, 25.2% of the patients had mild acne, 50.5% moderate acne, and 24.3% severe acne. A higher percentage of participants than controls required further evaluation and psychological consultant when studying each psychological problem. The most common psychological symptoms requiring treatment due to disturbed daily activities in acne group were psychoticism (34.0%) and depression (31.1%), respectively. Significant positive correlations were observed between the duration of illness and SCL-90 total score. When evaluating the SCL-90 scores, patients with multiple sites of involvement were affected more severely than those with a single site of involvement.                                                                                     Acne vulgaris has significant effects on psychological status. Effective concomitant anti-acne therapy and psychological assessment make significant contributions for the mental health and should be strongly recommended."
1736504	"Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL)-positive Staphylococcus aureus have been associated with suppurative infections; however, their precise role in skin infections has not been elucidated. We studied the rate of PVL-positive S. aureus in the different types of skin infections and compared follicular to nonfollicular skin infections.                                                                              In our institution, patients with a skin infection caused by S. aureus were enrolled in a prospective, observational cohort study (from July 1, 2003 to June 30, 2010). We studied the rate of PVL-positive S. aureus in the different clinical types of skin infections and compared the rate of PVL-positive S. aureus in follicular infections to that in nonfollicular infections.                                                                              A total 229 skin infections were included: 97 (42.5%) were caused by PVL-positive strains. Thirty-nine of the 53 (74%) follicular infections [8 of the 17 (47%) with folliculitis, 30 of the 35 (85.5%) with furuncles and 1 with a carbuncle (100%)] were caused by PVL-positive S. aureus, compared to 16 of the 131 (12%) nonfollicular infections (p <    0.001).

4079908	"The treatment of choice for patients with end-stage renal disease is renal transplantation. Urinary tract reconstruction is usually done by anti-reflux ureteroneocystostomy, of which there are several techniques. In this study, a comparison of previous studies related to complications and outcome of various extra-vesical uereteroneocystostomy techniques that were used in our center was made. From the year 1988, when renal transplantation was first performed in our center, we utilized many ureteroneocystostomy techniques including Lich-Grigoir, Barry, Tagochi, and finally Barry-Tagochi. With each conversion, we compared the results of the earlier technique with the new one. In addition, we collected the results of four previous studies conducted by our surgeons and analyzed the complications seen with ureteroneocystostomy. A total of 717 renal transplant recipients were included in our study; 214 of these patients were reimplanted by the Barry-Tagochi technique, 155 cases by the Barry technique, 44 cases by the Tagochi technique, and finally, 304 cases by the Lich-Grigor technique. There was no significant difference in the overall complications, urinary leakage and ureteral stenosis, and obstruction between the four groups. However, complicated hematuria was significantly more frequently seen in the Tagochi group (P = 0.002). Also, the mean time taken for ureteroneocystostomy was longer in the Lich-Grigor group (P = 0.001). We found that the Barry-Tagochi technique had an overall incidence of urological complications similar to that of the other extravesical techniques and was less time consuming."
4384315	"The impact of allograft injury time of onset on the risk of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) remains unknown. We hypothesized that episodes of late-onset (≥6 months) allograft injury would produce an augmented CXCR3/ligand immune response, leading to increased CLAD. In a retrospective single-center study, 1894 transbronchial biopsy samples from 441 lung transplant recipients were reviewed for the presence of acute rejection (AR), lymphocytic bronchiolitis (LB), diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), and organizing pneumonia (OP). The association between the time of onset of each injury pattern and CLAD was assessed by using multivariable Cox models with time-dependent covariates. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) CXCR3 ligand concentrations were compared between early- and late-onset injury patterns using linear mixed-effects models. Late-onset DAD and OP were strongly associated with CLAD: adjusted hazard ratio 2.8 (95% confidence interval 1.5-5.3) and 2.0 (1.1-3.4), respectively. The early-onset form of these injury patterns did not increase CLAD risk. Late-onset LB and acute rejection (AR) predicted CLAD in univariable models but lost significance after multivariable adjustment for late DAD and OP. AR was the only early-onset injury pattern associated with CLAD development. Elevated BAL CXCR3 ligand concentrations during late-onset allograft injury parallel the increase in CLAD risk and support our hypothesis that late allograft injuries result in a more profound CXCR3/ligand immune response."
4686549	"Cockayne syndrome (CS) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by acute sun sensitivity, cachectic dwarfism, and neurologic and skeletal abnormalities. Cultured skin fibroblasts from patients with this disease are known to be hypersensitive to the lethal effects of 254-nm UV radiation. We have studied the sensitivity of 254-nm UV radiation of lymphoblastoid lines derived from 3 typical CS patients, 1 atypical CS patient who had a very late age of onset of clinical manifestations, 2 patients who had both xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) and typical CS, and 3 heterozygous parents of these patients. Post-UV survival was determined by the trypan-blue dye-exclusion method. The lymphoblastoid lines from the 3 typical CS patients, the atypical CS patient, and the 2 patients with both CS and XP had decreased post-UV viability in comparison with lines from normal donors. Lines from the heterozygous parents had normal post-UV viability. The post-UV viability of the typical CS lines was similar to that of a XP complementation group C line. The relative post-UV viability of lymphoblastoid lines from the typical CS patients was similar to the relative post-UV survival of their fibroblast lines. The lymphoblastoid line from the atypical CS patient had a post-UV viability similar to that of the typical CS patients. Thus, the relative hypersensitivity of CS patients' cells in vitro does not reflect the severity or age of onset of the patients' clinical manifestations. The lymphoblastoid lines from the 2 patients who had both CS and XP were significantly more sensitive to the UV radiation than those from patients with only CS. Our studies demonstrate that lymphoblastoid lines from patients with CS are appropriate and useful cell lines for the study of the inherited hypersensitivity to UV radiation."
4652866	"Laser therapy of port wine stains (PWS) resistant to pulsed dye laser is challenging and controversial. Based on the theory of selective photothermolysis, vessels in such lesions may be specifically targeted with the laser wavelength of 755 nm. There is much deeper penetration of the near-infrared light and it is difficult to visualize laser-induced changes within the deeper dermis. The recognition of an appropriate immediate endpoint response with this wavelength would be helpful. This is a clinical observations report. We present examples of an appropriate PWS tissue response endpoint based on our clinical observations in resistant PWS treated with a 755 nm laser at high fluences (40-100 J/cm(2)), 1.5-ms pulse duration, with dynamic cooling device (DCD) cooling. Mild-to-moderate PWS lightening was associated with the immediate endpoint of a transient gray color that gradually evolved into persistent deep purpura within several minutes. We also discuss the clinical endpoints that represent undertreatment and overtreatment of PWS. It is important to attain, and maintain, the correct endpoint when treating PWS with this deeply penetrating near-infrared laser at high fluences in order to (a) induce lesional lightening, and (b) avoid deep dermal burns that may produce scarring. Judicious use of the 755 nm laser can be beneficial for resistant PWS."

Between November 2002 and August 2006, a total of 44 procedures were performed (35 right, eight left, and one aborted after surgical incision). The Clavien classification was used to record surgical complications as follows: grade I, alterations from the ideal postoperative course not requiring specialized pharmacological or surgical treatment; grade II, complications requiring specialized pharmacological treatment, blood transfusion, or total parental nutrition; grade III-a, complications requiring invasive intervention without general anesthesia; Grade III-b, requires general anesthesia; Grade IV-a, single organ dysfunction; Grade IV-b, multiorgan dysfunction; grade V, death; The suffix ""d"" indicated disability. In this study, grades I and II complications were considered minor, while grades III and V and any lasting disability, serious complications.                                                                              Male/female ratio was 34/10; median age was 25 years (range, 18 to 42); median hospital stay was 6 days (range, 4 to 14); and only two donors required intraoperative blood transfusion. After a median follow-up of 529 days (range, 8 to 1354), a total of 28 morbidities were encountered in 17 donors (38.6%), including nine donors (20.4%) who had serious complications. Among the 28 donor morbidities, 18 were grade I complications; three were grade III-a complications; five were grade III-b complications; and two were grade IV-a complications. No death was encountered in our experience.

2772901	"Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory immune-mediated disorder affecting the skin and other organs including joints. Over 1,300 transcripts are altered in psoriatic involved skin compared with normal skin. However, to our knowledge, global epigenetic profiling of psoriatic skin is previously unreported. Here, we describe a genome-wide study of altered CpG methylation in psoriatic skin. We determined the methylation levels at 27,578 CpG sites in skin samples from individuals with psoriasis (12 involved, 8 uninvolved) and 10 unaffected individuals. CpG methylation of involved skin differed from normal skin at 1,108 sites. Twelve mapped to the epidermal differentiation complex, upstream or within genes that are highly upregulated in psoriasis. Hierarchical clustering of 50 of the top differentially methylated (DM) sites separated psoriatic from normal skin samples with uninvolved skin exhibiting intermediate methylation. CpG sites where methylation was correlated with gene expression are reported. Sites with inverse correlations between methylation and nearby gene expression include those of KYNU, OAS2, S100A12, and SERPINB3, whose strong transcriptional upregulation is an important discriminator of psoriasis. Pyrosequencing of bisulfite-treated DNA from skin biopsies at three DM loci confirmed earlier findings and revealed reversion of methylation levels toward the non-psoriatic state after 1 month of anti-TNF-α therapy."
6532353	"Partially empty sella with growth hormone (GH) deficiency is rarely reported in association with PHACE (posterior fossa anomalies, cervicofacial infantile hemangiomas [IHs], arterial anomalies, cardiac defects, eye anomalies, and midline/ventral defects). Consequently, little is known about the effect of GH replacement on the proliferation and involution of IHs in children with PHACE. We describe two children with PHACE and partially empty sella, both of whom received GH replacement for treatment of hypopituitarism. In our first patient we observed erythema and prominence of the vasculature in the hemangioma shortly after initiation of therapy at age 20 months, although after 4 weeks of treatment the appearance of the hemangioma stabilized and little change was seen during eight additional years of therapy. In our second patient we noted enlargement of the hemangioma after starting low-dose GH at age 5 years, prompting discontinuation of GH replacement after 3 months of therapy. The hemangiomas continued to grow after discontinuation of GH treatment. GH administration in our patients was associated with erythema and prominence of IHs. Our findings suggest that GH replacement therapy may promote transient or more prolonged proliferation of IHs and should be administered with close clinical monitoring."
8269090	"Brucellosis is considered the most widespread zoonosis in the world. It has been reported that the prevalence of seropositivity among the Turkish population varies from 3% to 14%. We present a case of brucellosis after pediatric liver transplantation. A 15-year-old boy with the diagnosis of neuro Wilson's disease underwent deceased-donor liver transplantation. The postoperative immunosuppressive protocol consisted of steroids and tacrolimus. Two months after the operation the patient experienced fever to 40°C. The patient complained of poor appetite, headache, and diarrhea. He had had pancytopenia. Despite administration of appropriate antibiotics, antiviral and antifungal agents, fever persisted for >    1 month. Multiple blood, urine, stool, and sputum cultures were negative. Bone marrow aspirate revealed hypocellularity. Liver biopsy was performed, but rejection was not observed on biopsy specimen. Brucella serology was positive and Brucella agglutination titer was 1:320. Bone marrow culture was positive for Brucella but blood culture was negative. The patient was then treated with oral doxycycline and rifampin for 8 weeks. No previous case report about Brucella infection after liver transplantation has appeared in the literature, to our knowledge; our case is presented as the first. Bone marrow hypoplasia is a rare feature of Brucella infection. Our patient with brucellosis and pancytopenia had had hypocellular bone marrow. The clinical and hematologic findings resolved with treatment of the infection. Brucella infection should be suspected in liver transplanted recipients with fever of unknown origin, especially in a recipient who has lived in an endemic area. Brucella also should be considered as a possible diagnosis in patients with pancytopenia."
2532723	"Behçet's disease (BD), is a chronic, systemic vasculitis, which may affect all types and sizes of blood vessels. BD is associated with endothelial dysfunction and chronic inflammation. Endothelial dysfunction is the critical early step in the process of atherogenesis, and it is commonly investigated by measuring arterial stiffness. Mean platelet volume (MPV) has been investigated in relation with both thrombosis and inflammation. We aimed to investigate the relationship between an increased arterial stiffness and MPV in patients with Behçet's disease without significant cardiovascular involvement.                                                                              We studied 36 patients (20 males, mean age: 37.6 ± 11.7 years) who were diagnosed by the international diagnostic criteria of BD and 35 healthy controls (15 males, mean age: 35.0 ± 10.6 years), and the two groups were matched by age and gender. MPV levels and arterial stiffness measurements were compared in these groups.                                                                              Arterial stiffness was higher in patients with BD compared to control group. (BD and controls; 7.28 m/s, 6.64 m/s; respectively) (p: 0.02). MPV levels were also significantly higher in patients with BD compared to control group. (BD and controls; 8.86 ± 0.81 fl, 8.39 ± 0.96 fl, respectively) (p: 0.02). Additionally, arterial stiffness correlated positively with age, the duration of disease and MPV levels in patients with BD (p: 0.002, 0.03, 0.02 respectively).                                                                                      In our study, increased MPV is associated with arterial stiffness in patients with BD without significant cardiovascular involvement. It shows that there is a relationship between thrombosis and chronic inflammation in BD. Furthermore, MPV is also a moderate predictor of cardiovascular disease and represents an increase in platelet activation. These findings provide further evidence of a link between inflammation and thrombosis in patients with BD."
1791328	"With the aim of facilitating the ex vivo manipulation of peripheral blood hematopoietic progenitors (CPCs = circulating progenitor cells) collected by leukapheresis, we removed polymorphonuclear cells and monocytes that naturally adhere to nylon wool fibers. Leukapheresed cells harvested at the time of hematopoietic recovery after cancer therapy with high-dose cyclophosphamide plus hematopoietic growth factors were incubated with nylon wool fibers for 1 h at 37 degrees C. Evaluation of the cells non-adherent to the nylon wool in all experiments (n = 14) showed that the median recovery of nucleated cells and CPCs detected as CD34+ cells, CFU-GM and BFU-E was 16.4% (range 4.8%-34.0%), 60.0% (range 30.8-80.8%), 60.9% (range 33.4-74.5%) and 65.5% (range 30.8-69.2%), respectively. Therefore exposure to the nylon wool determined a selective removal of mature cells and a complementary enrichment of CPCs. The wide range of results depended on the significantly different cell compositions of the unmanipulated leukaphereses. The latter from patients receiving rhG-CSF (n = 10) comprised a median of 88.5% (range 77.8-93.8%) and 11.5% (range 6.2-22.2%) polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cells, respectively. In contrast, leukaphereses from patients receiving rhGM-CSF or PIXY321 (n = 4) comprised a median of 71.1% (range 55.4-85.0%) and 28.9% (range 15.0-44.6%) polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cells, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
1238778	"OKTcdr4a (IMUCLONE) is a humanized anti-CD4 IgG4 monoclonal antibody that retains the binding and in vitro immunosuppressive properties of the parent murine antibody. Psoriasis is a chronic disease for which treatment with multiple doses of monoclonal antibodies is likely to be required for adequate control.                                                                                  This study was performed to test the efficacy and safety of OKTcdr4a, given in sequential courses over a period of several weeks, in the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis vulgaris.                                                                              Twenty-eight patients (45.6 +/- 10.1 years of age) were studied, with a mean pretreatment Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score of 18.3. In the first double-blind phase of the study, patients were randomized to receive OKTcdr4a as a 225 mg/course (low dose), 750 mg/course (high dose), or placebo divided into 3 identical infusions over a 5-day period. After 42 days, patients who met the criteria for re-treatment with OKTcdr4a were re-treated with the 750 mg/course in an open phase of the study.                                                                              After the double-blind course of treatment, the mean PASI decreased by 11% in the placebo group, by 4% in the low-dose group, and by 17% in the high-dose group at 15 days. Twenty patients met the criteria for re-treatment (ie, did not experience a decrease in PASI score of 50% at 42 days). They were re-treated with OKTcdr4a at 43 days with the 750 mg/course in the open phase of the study. By day 99, the mean PASI score decreased from 19.9 at baseline to 17 in those patients who had received either placebo or low-dose OKTcdr4a followed by high-dose OKTcdr4a. In contrast, the mean PASI score decreased from 17.4 at baseline to only 7.7 in those patients who had received high-dose OKTcdr4a for both courses. Sustained CD4 saturation was not necessary for sustained clinical response. No patients had significant changes in circulating CD4(+) T-cell counts. The infusions were well tolerated.                                                                                     Targeting CD4 using sequential treatments with a humanized monoclonal antibody (OKTcdr4a) may offer another therapeutic option for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis."

4165199	"The prevalence of low vitamin D levels and associated risks has led to an increase in supplementation. However, a ""U-shaped"" relationship has been suggested between vitamin D status and adverse effects, with risks observed both in low and high levels. While risks associated with low levels of vitamin D have been extensively studied, the risks of higher levels of vitamin D have not been as widely circulated. We sought to describe key observed adverse risks with vitamin D supplementation and higher serum 25(OH)-D levels in healthy adult populations."
4070508	"The role of T-cell exhaustion in the failure of clearance of viral infections and tumors is well established. There are several ongoing trials to reverse T-cell exhaustion for treatment of chronic viral infections and tumors. The mechanisms leading to T-cell exhaustion and its role in transplantation, however, are only beginning to be appreciated and are the focus of the present review.                                                                                      Exhausted T cells exhibit a distinct molecular profile reflecting combinatorial mechanisms involving the interaction of multiple transcription factors important in control of cell metabolism, acquisition of effector function and memory capacity. Change of microenvironmental cues and limiting leukocyte recruitment can modulate T-cell exhaustion. Impaired leukocyte recruitment induces T-cell exhaustion and prevents allograft rejection.                                                                                  Preventing or reversing T-cell exhaustion may lead to prevention of transplant tolerance or triggering of rejection; therefore, caution should be exercised in the use of agents blocking inhibitory receptors for the treatment of chronic viral infections or tumors in transplant recipients. Further definition of the role of T-cell exhaustion in clinical transplantation and an understanding of the mechanisms of induction of T-cell exhaustion are needed to develop strategies for preventing allograft rejection and induction of tolerance."
6137266	"Verrucous carcinoma (VC) is a clinicopathologic entity which is defined as a locally aggressive, clinically exophytic, slow-growing, well-differentiated, squamous cell carcinoma with negligible metastatic potential. The cutaneous form of VC is typically known to arise from the palmoplantar and the genitocrural areas. Involvement of the scalp is extremely rare. Multiple synchronous involvement of the scalp by VC along with associated generalized verruca vulgaris has possibly never been reported before. We present this unique report of VC in a 38-year-old male patient with emphasis on its atypical clinical presentation and the resultant challenges in management. Interestingly, the tumor cells of our patient were confirmed to be positive for human papillomavirus infection by polymerase chain reaction and by p16 immunohistochemistry."
2861119	"The outcome of children who had living-donor liver transplant was analyzed according to their status before transplant, and we analyzed the outcome of critically ill patients.                                                                                            This was a retrospective analysis of children who received primary living-donor liver transplant at Kyoto University Hospital. According to the criteria of the United Network for Organ Sharing, we divided patients into 3 groups: Group A patients had been admitted to the intensive care unit before living-donor liver transplant; Group B patients were hospitalized but did not require intensive care unit stay; and Group C patients were living at home and underwent elective transplant.                                                                              A total 685 patients met inclusion criteria. Children in Group A were younger than Group B and received liver grafts from younger donors than Group B and C. Group A patients had marked impairment in liver and renal function and coagulation profile and needed higher volumes of fresh frozen plasma transfusions. Group A patients had significantly worse outcomes and early patient death than the other group; Group A patient survival was 68.3%, 63.2%, 60.1%, and 56.1% at 1, 5, 10, and 15 years after living-donor liver transplant (P <    .0001). Group A had worse graft survival than other groups (P <    .0001), and Group A graft survival was 68.3%, 65.9%, 54.1%, and 49.9% at 1, 5, 10, and 15 years. Low gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase was an independent risk factor for patient death in Group A (hazard ratio, 1.004; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-1.007) (P <    .05). Group A patients had a higher rate of multidrug-resistant hospital-acquired infections.

1887016	"Among the causes of the nephrotic syndrome in renal allografts, minimal change disease is a rarity with only few cases described in the medical literature. Most cases described have occurred early in the post-transplant course. There is no established treatment for the condition but prognosis is favorable. We describe a case of minimal change disease that developed 8 years after a successful transplantation of a renal allograft in a middle-aged woman. The nephrotic syndrome was accompanied by deterioration of allograft function. Treatment with mycophenolate mofetil was successful in inducing remission and stabilizing allograft function."
6791237	"Radiation therapy of Darier's disease with both conventional x-rays and Grenz rays has been advocated in the past. A comparison of the effects of x-rays and Grenz rays in a typical case of Darier's disease showed some improvement with both qualities of ionizing radiation. The effects of x-rays were superior to those of Grenz rays with improvement of more rapid onset and longer duration. However, spontaneous improvement noted in both treated and untreated areas demonstrates the difficulty in evaluating the benefits of ionizing radiation on Darier's disease. The authors do not recommend the use of radiation therapy in Darier's disease except in cases where a temporary anti-inflammatory effect is desired."
2549316	"To investigate how the fatty acid composition of membrane lipids influences cell growth and mitochondrial respiration, in particular the expression and capacity of alternative oxidase (AOX), under cold stress, we used the Arabidopsis thaliana fad2 knockout and FAD3+ -overexpressing cultured cells lines affected in extrachloroplastic fatty acid desaturation activities. At 22 degrees C, fad2 mitochondria exhibited a low polyunsaturated fatty acid content and low protein to lipid ratio, while mitochondria from FAD3+ were enriched in linolenic acid and in total membrane protein. As a consequence, both mutants showed a higher membrane microviscosity than the wild type. After exposure to 9 degrees C, FAD3+ mitochondria exhibited lower microviscosity and lower rigidification upon a temperature downshift than fad2. Furthermore, the extent of reduction of cell growth and respiratiory rates in the phosphorylating state was positively related to the cold sensitivity of each cell line, being more pronounced in fad2 that in the wild type, whereas the stability of those parameters reflected the cold resistance of FAD3+. In contrast, an increase in AOX capacity was observed in the three cell lines at 9 degrees C. These inductions were correlated to AOX protein amounts and seem to result from an accumulation of AOX1c transcripts in the three cell lines and of AOX1a transcripts in wild-type and fad2 cells. The fact that there is no direct relationship between the degree of cold tolerance of each cell line and their ability to enhance their AOX capacity suggests that the participation of AOX in the response of Arabidopsis cells to cold stress does not necessarily favor cold tolerance."
9928313	"Experiments have been carried out to determine the basis for the dependence of chloroplast pigment synthesis on protein synthesis in dark-grown cells of Euglena gracilis greening in the light. The complete inhibition of chlorophyll synthesis brought about by actidione (10 μg/ml) when added half way through the greening process was not relieved, even to the slightest extent, when 0.01 M δ-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) was also present. The much smaller inhibition of chlorophyll synthesis brought about by chloramphenicol (2 mg/ml) was also relieved little, if at all, by the addition of ALA. It is concluded that the inhibition of chlorophyll synthesis by actidione can not be solely or primarily due to lack of ALA resulting from the decay of possibly labile enzymes of ALA synthesis, but could be due to inhibition of synthesis of the thylakoid structural protein. The results obtained with chloramphenicol are difficult to interpret because of the possibility that the drug, at high concentration, directly inhibits processes other than protein synthesis.Chlorophyll and carotenoid synthesis by E. gracilis were both markedly stimulated by the addition of ALA. It is suggested that the rate of chlorophyll synthesis in the greening cells is limited by the rate of formation of ALA. The stimulation of formation of carotenoids as well as chlorophyll may indicate that the cells have a mechanism for ensuring that the rate of carotenoid synthesis does not fall below a certain proportion of the rate of chlorophyll synthesis.A nomogram has been devised from which the concentrations of chlorophylls a and b, and total chlorophyll can be read off once the absorbances of an 80% acetone extract at 663 and 645 mμ have been determined."
8435657	"Mutant lines defective for each of the four starch debranching enzyme (DBE) genes (AtISA1, AtISA2, AtISA3, and AtPU1) detected in the nuclear genome of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) were produced and analyzed. Our results indicate that both AtISA1 and AtISA2 are required for the production of a functional isoamylase-type of DBE named Iso1, the major isoamylase activity found in leaves. The absence of Iso1 leads to an 80% decrease in the starch content in both lines and to the accumulation of water-soluble polysaccharides whose structure is similar to glycogen. In addition, the residual amylopectin structure in the corresponding mutant lines displays a strong modification when compared to the wild type, suggesting a direct, rather than an indirect, function of Iso1 during the synthesis of amylopectin. Mutant lines carrying a defect in AtISA3 display a strong starch-excess phenotype at the end of both the light and the dark phases accompanied by a small modification of the amylopectin structure. This result suggests that this isoamylase-type of DBE plays a major role during starch mobilization. The analysis of the Atpu1 single-mutant lines did not lead to a distinctive phenotype. However, Atisa2/Atpu1 double-mutant lines display a 92% decrease in starch content. This suggests that the function of pullulanase partly overlaps that of Iso1, although its implication remains negligible when Iso1 is present within the cell."
5420937	"Mixed allogeneic bone marrow chimerism induces tolerance to solid organ grafts. Although we previously reported that partially ablative conditioning with 700 cGy of total body irradiation (TBI) is sufficient to allow for bone marrow engraftment in mice, we determined that a minimum of 1000 cGy was required in the rat. Because T cells and NK cells are critical in bone marrow graft rejection, our purpose was to examine whether targeting of radioresistant NK cells and/or T cells in the recipient hematopoietic microenvironment would reduce the TBI dose required for engraftment of allogeneic rat bone marrow.                                                                              Wistar Furth rats received either anti-NK3.2.3 monoclonal antibodies on days -3 and -2, anti-lymphocyte serum on day -5, a combination of both or no pretreatment. TBI was performed on day 0 and rats were reconstituted with 100x10(6) T cell-depleted bone marrow cells from ACI donors.                                                                              Engraftment of T cell-depleted rat bone marrow was readily achieved in animals conditioned with 1000 cGy TBI alone (12/12) and the level of donor chimerism averaged 89%. At 900 cGy TBI alone only one of eight recipients engrafted. In striking contrast, 11 of 12 animals pretreated with anti-NK monoclonal antibodies and irradiated with 900 cGy showed donor chimerism at a mean level of 41%. No further enhancement of bone marrow engraftment could be achieved when recipients were pretreated with antilymphocyte serum alone or antilymphocyte serum plus anti-NK monoclonal antibodies. Mixed allogeneic chimeras exhibited stable multilineage chimerism and donor-specific tolerance to subsequent cardiac allografts.                                                                                     Specific targeting of radioresistant host NK cells allows for a significant reduction of the TBI dose required for allogeneic bone marrow engraftment."
8102161	"The topical calcineurin inhibitors pimecrolimus and tacrolimus have been demonstrated to be an effective new anti-inflammatory therapy. The only clinically relevant side-effect reported is transient application site burning and stinging itch at the beginning of topical therapy.                                                                                   In order to understand the underlying mechanism of this effect, we examined whether or not the compounds are able to stimulate neuropeptide release in normal murine skin as well as in a mouse model of experimentally induced irritant contact dermatitis.                                                                              Balb/c mice were treated with 1% pimecrolimus cream or 0.1% tacrolimus ointment. Untreated and corresponding vehicle-treated mice served as controls. Skin specimens were investigated by light, immunofluorescence and electron microscopy as well as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and polymerase chain reaction.                                                                              Topical application of pimecrolimus and tacrolimus was followed by an initial release of substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide from primary afferent nerve fibres in murine skin during the early inflammatory response. The release of the neuropeptides and their binding to mast cells (MCs) led to MC degranulation. Mediators of MCs such as histamine and tryptase may induce pruritus and burning by binding to the corresponding receptors (histamine receptor 1, proteinase-activated receptor 2) on sensory nerve fibres, which explains the initial side-effects during therapy with calcineurin inhibitors.                                                                                      It may be speculated that calcineurin inhibitors directly stimulate intracellular signalling pathways or bind to ion channels such as transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 or receptors involved in nociception."
5589608	"An antiserum raised against dehydrin from maize (Zea mays) recognised several polypeptides in extracts of pea (Pisum sativum) cotyledons. A cDNA expression library was prepared from mRNA of developing cotyledons, screened with the antiserum and positive clones were purified and characterised. The nucleotide sequence of one such clone, pPsB12, contained an open reading frame which would encode a polypeptide with regions of significant amino acid sequence similarity to dehydrins from other plant species. The deduced amino acid sequence of the pea dehydrin encoded by B12 is 197 amino acids in length, has a high glycine content (25.9%), lacks tryptophan and is highly hydrophilic. The polypeptide has an estimated molecular mass of 20.4 kDa and pI = 6.4. An in vitro synthesised product from the clone comigrates with one of the in vivo proteins recognised by the antiserum. A comparison of the pea dehydrin sequence with sequences from other species revealed conserved amino acid regions: an N-terminal DEYGNP and a lysine-rich block (KIKEKLPG), both of which are present in two copies. Unexpectedly, pea dehydrin lacks a stretch of serine residues which is conserved in other dehydrins. B12 mRNA and dehydrin proteins accumulated in dehydration-stressed seedlings, associated with elevated levels of endogenous abscisic acid (ABA). Applied ABA induced expression of dehydrins in unstressed seedlings. Dehydrin expression was rapidly reversed when seedlings were removed from the stress or from treatment with ABA and placed in water. During pea cotyledon development, dehydrin mRNA and proteins accumulated in mid to late embryogenesis. Dehydrin proteins were some of the most actively synthesised at about the time of maximum fresh weight and represent about 2% of protein in mature cotyledons."
9451791	"Interstitial granulomatous dermatitis (IGD) is a reactive phenomenon accompanying disorders including autoimmune disease, lymphoproliferative disorders and drug reactions. Histologically, IGD shows a granulomatous infiltrate surrounding piecemeal fragmentation of collagen in the diffuse interstitium. IGD presents with linear cords, papules and plaques mainly on the trunk and extremities. Herein, we report a case with peculiar clinical features that were histopathologically consistent with IGD. A 74-year-old man presented with periungual painful erythema, nail deformity of all fingers and labial, penile and anal erosive erythema. Histopathological examination of the lesions showed interface dermatitis and a diffuse interstitial granulomatous infiltrate mainly composed of CD68-positive histiocytes and lymphocytes. Degenerative collagen bundles were also observed in granulomas. C-reactive protein and the white blood cell count were elevated, but further examinations did not reveal systemic inflammatory disorders such as autoimmune disease, lymphoproliferative disorder, inflammatory bowel disease or drug hypersensitivity. The lesions were successfully treated with oral and topical steroids."
7009736	"Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are characterized by keratinocyte apoptosis and necrosis, resulting in epidermal detachment. Although monocytes abundantly infiltrate the epidermis in SJS/TEN skin lesions, the properties and functions of these cells have not been fully examined.                                                                                   To determine the properties of monocytes infiltrating into the epidermis in SJS/TEN.                                                                              Immunostaining of skin sections was performed to examine the membrane markers of monocytes infiltrating into skin lesions.                                                                              Immunostaining of cryosections from 11 SJS/TEN skin lesions revealed numerous CD14+ monocytes located along the dermoepidermal junction and throughout the epidermis. The cells coexpressed CD16, CD11c and HLA-DR. CD14+ CD16+ cells were identified in very early lesions without epidermal damage, suggesting that their infiltration is a cause, rather than a result, of epidermal damage. Moreover, these cells expressed CD80, CD86 and CD137 ligand, indicative of their ability to facilitate the proliferation and cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells. CD16+ cells infiltrating the epidermis and detected at the dermoepidermal junction were immunostained and counted in paraffin-embedded skin sections obtained from 47 patients with drug rash manifested as TEN, SJS, maculopapular-type rash or erythema multiform-type rash. The number of CD16+ monocytes infiltrating the epidermis increased significantly, depending on the grade of epidermal damage.                                                                                      These findings suggest that the appearance of CD14+ CD16+ cells of monocyte lineage plays an important role in the epidermal damage associated with SJS/TEN, most probably by enhancing the cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells."
4954667	"Renal transplantation is the most optimal way to manage children with end-stage renal disease. Despite its benefits, pediatric renal transplantation is a challenge for several transplantation centers in terms of achieving a satisfactory outcome. We sought to compare the long-term outcome of pediatric versus adult recipients who underwent renal transplantation.                                                                             We examined, 2631 recipients of a first kidney from a living donor between 1982 and 2002. The two groups were matched for immunosuppressive therapy and number of HLA mismatches. The patients were divided into a pediatric (n=301; age <   or= 18 years) and an adult group (n=2330; age >    18 years) to compare 5-year patient and graft survivals.                                                                              The mean ages of the pediatric and adult groups were 40 +/- 13 and 14 +/- 13 years, respectively. The 5-year graft survival was lower among the pediatric versus the adult group (56% vs 68%; P=.015) with no difference in patient survival (88% vs 86%; P>   .05).                                                                                     The poorer graft survival in pediatric transplantation may be due to the nature of pediatric transplantation, in terms of inconsistent adherence to medication regimens, worse side effects of medications, higher rate of graft rejection due to recurrent disease, and more intense immunoreactivity of children."
8884254	"Non-enzymatic glycation occurring in normal human skin plays an important part in ageing. OBJECTIVES To visualize and quantify, in human subjects, the extent of glycation during human dermal intrinsic and actinic ageing, and to develop a reliable reproducible in vitro model for evaluating the efficacy of potential inhibitors of glycation.                                                                              By immunohistochemistry using a monoclonal antibody recognizing carboxymethyl lysine, an advanced glycation end-product (AGE) (first objective), and by incubating dead de-epidermized dermis (DED) with glucose to simulate ageing-induced glycation in a human dermal equivalent model (second objective).                                                                              We found that glycation of the dermis generally arises after 35 years, then increases rapidly with intrinsic ageing. We also noticed an enhancement of glycation by solar irradiation that occurred via glycation of the elastic fibre network or solar elastosis tissue. In the model, production of AGEs appeared in a time-dependent way, mimicking glycation observed in vivo during chronological ageing. Irradiation of DED before incubation with glucose strongly enhanced induction of AGEs, corresponding to the effect of solar irradiation on AGEs observed in vivo.                                                                                      These results confirm a marked increase of AGEs during intrinsic ageing in normal human skin and also suggest that glycation is enhanced in photoaged skin."
2422884	"Development of effective multidrug immunosuppressive regimens and improvements in the management of chronically immunosuppressed patients have produced extraordinary patient and allograft survival in clinical organ transplantation. Unfortunately, significant problems of morbidity and mortality related to chronic immunosuppression remain. Thus, there is an enormous motivation and interest in inducing specific unresponsiveness (tolerance) to clinical solid organ allografts. Operational clinical tolerance may be defined as stable, normal graft function in the total absence of a requirement for maintenance immunosuppression. Alternatively, the concept of employing tolerogenic strategies to permit graft acceptance with dramatically reduced immunosuppression requirements is referred to as prope' or minimal immunosuppression tolerance. There have been isolated examples of clinical tolerance, usually in the context of spontaneous or induced donor chimerism, excellent HLA matching, and/or drug weaning or patient noncompliance. The various attempts that are currently being employed to induce some type of clinical tolerance are reviewed in this manuscript. Strategies in which all immunosuppression was to be withdrawn from the recipient (donor-specific unresponsiveness) are first discussed. These include strategies that utilize initial immunoablation with varying doses of irradiation and/or lymphocytic antibodies with or without donor-specific bone marrow infusion and short-term standard immunosuppressive therapy. Strategies to induce prope' or minimal immunosuppression tolerance that utilize induction lymphoablation with polyclonal or monoclonal antilymphocyte antibodies, with or without donor bone marrow infusion, followed by limited low-dose immunosuppressive therapy are also discussed. The ethical considerations in testing clinical tolerance strategies and protocols are discussed in detail. The limited number of clinical tolerance studies already available affirms that carefully supervised weaning of immunosuppressive drugs in controlled tolerance trials is not unreasonable, especially when monitored by protocol allograft biopsies. Initial results suggest that aggressively treated low-grade steroid-responsive rejection reactions in the absence of immune-mediated tissue destruction does not necessarily require resumption of high-dose immunosuppression. Finally, the role of donor bone marrow infusions in facilitating tolerance/hyporesponsiveness induction needs to be studied and expanded."
6045026	"Agnus Castus Fruit is defined in the European Pharmacopoeia as the dried ripe fruit of Vitex agnus-castus. In Europe it is used as a medicine targeting premenstrual syndrome and climacteric disorder. In Japan, Agnus Castus Fruit is becoming popular as a raw material for over-the-counter drugs and health food products, though its congenic species, Vitex rotundifolia and Vitex trifolia, have been used as Shrub Chaste Tree Fruit in traditional medicines. Therefore, it is important to discriminate these Vitex plants from the viewpoint of regulatory science. Here we tried to identify putative marker compounds that distinguish between Agnus Castus Fruit and Shrub Chaste Tree Fruit. We analyzed extracts of each crude drug by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and performed differential analysis by comparison of each chromatogram to find one or more peaks characteristic of Agnus Castus Fruit. A peak was isolated and identified as an equilibrium mixture of new compounds named chastol (1) and epichastol (1a). The planar structures of 1 and 1a were determined spectroscopically. Their relative configurations were revealed by nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy and differential nuclear Overhauser effect-NMR data. Since avoiding contamination from closely related species is needed for the quality control of natural pharmaceuticals, this information will be valuable to establish a method for the quality control of both, Agnus Castus Fruit and Shrub Chaste Tree Fruit products."
6742350	"KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) is an international independent body aiming to 'improve the care and outcomes of kidney disease patients worldwide, through the development and implementation of clinical practice guidelines'. Recently, the KDIGO work group has produced comprehensive clinical practice guidelines for the care of kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). The guideline makes recommendations for immunosuppression, graft monitoring, as well as prevention and treatment of infection, cardiovascular disease, malignancy and other complications that are common in KTRs, including haematological and bone disorders. Because most guidelines were 'soft' rather than 'strong', and because global guidelines need to be adapted and implemented into the regional context where they are used, the European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) Advisory Board appointed a work group of transplant nephrologists and surgeons to review the newest KDIGO guideline and comment on its relevance and applicability for European KTRs. In this article, we concentrate only on those guidelines which we considered worth amending or adapting. All guidelines not mentioned are fully endorsed."
1801566	"Visual disturbance in the course of melanoma is rare. Specific localized metastases and drug toxic effects are frequently the cause. Recognition of a retinopathy raises several questions when the diagnosis of melanoma-associated retinopathy (MAR) can be confirmed. Descriptions of such patients in dermatologic literature are rare and deserve attention because therapeutic decisions are mandatory.                                                                                   A 70-year-old woman had a first melanoma in 1985 and a second primary melanoma in 1994. Axillary lymph node involvement occurred in November 2000, leading to surgery and chemotherapy. In December 2001, she had sudden bilateral visual loss, with shimmering blobs of color and flickering photopsias. Computed tomography and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging ruled out localized tumor on the eyes or optic nerves or evolution of disease. Ophthalmologic examination revealed a bilateral posterior uveitis, with hyalitis and progressive destruction of retinal pigment. The electrophysiologic data confirmed the diagnosis of MAR. Symptoms improved after systemic corticosteroid therapy, with no relapse after tapering doses despite worsening of melanoma.                                                                                      As a rare paraneoplastic visual syndrome possibly leading to blindness, MAR is characterized by bipolar cell involvement without photoreceptor cell impairment. Also, MAR is linked to the presence of autoantibodies directed against melanoma antigens that cross-react with the rod bipolar cells of the retina. Corticosteroid therapy is rarely beneficial. Our case of MAR is noteworthy because it involved a woman, was associated with an uveitis, and improved with corticosteroid therapy."

Consecutive clinical case series.                                                                              Referral university medical center.                                                                               A consecutive sample of patients with a variety of high-risk nonmelanoma cutaneous malignancies without evidence of regional lymph node metastases.                                                                                   Sentinel node biopsies were performed using preoperative lymphoscintigraphy, blue dye, and intraoperative radiolocalization.                                                                                           Sensitivity, determined by comparing the results of biopsy specimen evaluation with those of completion lymphadenectomy and/or clinical follow-up.                                                                              Twenty-four patients underwent sentinel node biopsy for the staging of 29 nodal basins identified by lymphoscintigraphy. Primary diagnoses were squamous cell carcinoma (n = 17), Merkel cell carcinoma (n = 5), and adenocarcinoma (n = 2). Seven patients (29%) had a tumor-positive sentinel node. Sentinel node biopsy followed by complete lymphadenectomy was performed in 12 patients and sentinel node biopsy alone in 12 patients. Tumor-positive lymph nodes were noted in 8 patients, 7 of whom also had positive sentinel nodes. There was 1 false-positive result (1/8 [12%]), in a patient with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the scalp. At a median follow-up of 10 months, no recurrences in a sentinel node-negative basin have been noted. Compared with all information, the sensitivity of sentinel node staging was 88% and the negative predictive value was 0.94.                                                                                      Sentinel node biopsy is a minimally invasive staging procedure useful in identifying occult regional lymph node disease in selected patients with nonmelanoma cutaneous malignancies. Further studies to verify these findings and develop formal guidelines are indicated."
1249694	"Clinically-applicable protocols that promote tolerance to vascularized skin grafts may contribute to more widespread use of composite tissue transplantation. We compared the properties of alloantigen (Ag)-pulsed, rapamycin (Rapa)-conditioned and control bone marrow-derived host myeloid dendritic cells (DCs) and their potential, together with transient immunosuppression (anti-lymphocyte serum+cyclosporine), to promote long-term, vascularized skin graft survival in Lewis rats across a full MHC barrier. Both types of DCs expressed low levels of CD86, but Rapa DC expressed lower levels of MHC II and CD40 and were less stimulatory in MLR. While both Rapa and control DCs produced low levels of IL-12p70 and moderate levels of IL-6 and IL-10 following TLR ligation, Rapa DC secreted significantly lower levels of IL-6 and IL-10 in response to LPS. Donor Ag-pulsed Rapa DC, but not control DC, induced long-term skin graft survival (median survival time >   133 days) when administered 7 and 14 days post-transplant. Circulating T cells in hosts with long-surviving grafts were hyporesponsive to donor alloAg stimulation, but proliferated in response to third-party stimulation and produced IFN-gamma and IL-10. When recipients of long-surviving grafts were challenged with skin grafts, donor but not third-party grafts were prolonged, suggesting underlying regulatory mechanisms. Both flow cytometry and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that donor Ag-pulsed Rapa DC infusion expanded CD4+ Foxp3+ Treg in recipients' spleens, graft-associated lymph nodes and the graft. These data demonstrate for the first time that pharmacologically-modified, donor Ag-pulsed host DC administered post-transplant can promote indefinite vascularized skin graft survival, associated with Treg expansion."
9833347	"A case of systemic sclerosis (SS) which developed keloidal lesions (nodular scleroderma) on the chest during D-penicillamine (DPC) therapy is reported. The 36-year-old woman showed rapidly progressing skin sclerosis with lung and esophageal involvement, and DPC was started at the age of 38. Skin sclerosis as a whole had improved to some extent, when keloidal nodules developed on the upper chest at the age of 44. Since there were no other findings suggestive of adverse reactions caused by DPC, we speculate that activation of the fibroblasts in these lesions occurred despite the suppressive effect of DPC."
3878617	"The purpose of this study was to describe the epidemiological and clinical features, course, response to treatment, and prognosis of pemphigus in the Mediterranean region of Turkey.                                                                              All patients with confirmed pemphigus were prospectively enrolled in two major dermatology departments in the cities of Adana and Antalya in the Mediterranean region between March 1998 and March 2004. Details including demography, findings of clinical examinations, treatment, course, and prognosis were recorded.                                                                              One hundred and forty-eight patients with pemphigus were diagnosed during the 6-year period, with a prevalence of 1.46 and an annual incidence of 0.24 per 100,000 in this region. There was a female predominance with a male to female ratio of 1:1.4. Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) was the most common clinical subtype, identified in 123 patients (83%). The mean age of onset was 43. In 101 (82%) patients with PV, disease began as persistent oral ulcers. The majority of the patients with PV could be managed with middle or high-dose steroids (60-140 mg/day). Complete clinical remission was obtained in 41 (39.4%) patients. The mortality rate was 4.8%.                                                                                      A moderately high incidence of pemphigus was found in the Mediterranean region of Turkey as compared with that encountered in other countries. The commonest clinical subtype was PV with a 9.5-fold higher incidence than pemphigus foliaceus. It is more frequent in middle-aged people and has a female predominance. Although a relatively higher dose of steroid was needed to control the PV, the disease completely remitted in a significant proportion of the patients."
4435990	"A 12-year-old girl with Fanconi anaemia (FA) received a bone marrow transplant from her HLA-identical brother following conditioning with cyclophosphamide (20 mg/kg), thoraco-abdominal radiation (TAI) (4 Gy) and equine anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) (90 mg/kg). Engraftment was delayed and initially tenuous, and was followed by mixed chimerism (MC) over a follow-up period of 2 years. DNA analysis of engraftment was performed on whole peripheral blood and on separated granulocytes, B and T lymphocytes using PCR detection of CA tandem repeat polymorphisms. At 10 weeks post BMT, granulocytes were predominantly donor, but B and T lymphocytes recipient, in origin. Over the subsequent 90 weeks, granulocytes and B lymphocytes were donor-derived, whilst T cells showed persistent MC but with an increasing donor component. Marrow haemopoietic function (Hb, ANC and platelet count) improved gradually in parallel with a rise in the proportion of donor lymphocyte engraftment. We postulate that a population of recipient lymphocytes survived conditioning and in turn delayed the development of full donor chimerism. Although transient MC has been described after allogeneic BMT in FA, its association with delayed engraftment, and persistence for more than 1 year post BMT, has not been documented clearly."
1478601	"Non-invasive, high-throughput screening methods are valuable tools in breeding for abiotic stress tolerance in plants. Optical signals such as chlorophyll fluorescence emission can be instrumental in developing new screening techniques. In order to examine the potential of chlorophyll fluorescence to reveal plant tolerance to low temperatures, we used a collection of nine Arabidopsis thaliana accessions and compared their fluorescence features with cold tolerance quantified by the well established electrolyte leakage method on detached leaves. We found that, during progressive cooling, the minimal chlorophyll fluorescence emission rose strongly and that this rise was highly dependent on the cold tolerance of the accessions. Maximum quantum yield of PSII photochemistry and steady state fluorescence normalized to minimal fluorescence were also highly correlated to the cold tolerance measured by the electrolyte leakage method. In order to further increase the capacity of the fluorescence detection to reveal the low temperature tolerance, we applied combinatorial imaging that employs plant classification based on multiple fluorescence features. We found that this method, by including the resolving power of several fluorescence features, can be well employed to detect cold tolerance already at mild sub-zero temperatures. Therefore, there is no need to freeze the screened plants to the largely damaging temperatures of around -15°C. This, together with the method's easy applicability, represents a major advantage of the fluorescence technique over the conventional electrolyte leakage method."
7891153	"Patients with infantile nephropathic cystinosis have progressive accumulation of cystine in tissues leading to delayed extrarenal complications. No simple tool is available to evaluate the level of body cystine accumulation.

Nine patients and control subjects were recruited for this study. Images were acquired by means of a near-infrared reflectance confocal laser scanning microscope.                                                                              Scattered bright particles within the papillary dermis were observed in all patients but not in control subjects. The density of particles ranged from numerous (+++) to very few (+/-) and their distribution was heterogeneous. Electron microscopy confirmed that these particles corresponded to cystine crystal deposits within dermal fibroblasts. The density of cystine crystals within the dermis was greater in older patients, in patients with a high leukocyte cystine concentration, and with delayed cysteamine therapy. There was no correlation between the density of cystine deposits and renal disease or hypopigmentation but high levels of deposition occurred in association with extrarenal manifestations.                                                                                      This is a preliminary study on a small sample of patients. Repeated examination and longer follow-up is necessary.                                                                                     In vivo reflectance confocal microscopy of the skin appears to be a noninvasive means of assessing body cystine accumulation in infantile cystinosis and could be used as a complementary marker of treatment response in addition to leukocyte cystine measurement."
1319131	"5-S-Cysteinyldopa (5-S-CD) is found in all pigment-producing cells and is the major precursor of phaeomelanin. However, the melanocyte specificity of the compound has been questioned. In order to elucidate the origin of 5-S-CD, we have now systematically studied the relationship between the 5-S-CD excretion in urine and the size of the melanocyte organ, UV-induced melanocyte proliferation, skin type, and the erythemal reaction. The skin type had no influence on the basal excretion of 5-S-CD. There was no significant correlation between the basal 5-S-CD excretion and the size of the melanocyte organ; that is, the number of skin melanocytes and nevi. During the irradiation, subjects with skin type II developed a more pronounced erythema (p less than 0.01) and had a significantly higher 5-S-CD excretion than those with skin type III-IV (p less than 0.01). No correlation was found between 5-S-CD excretion and UV-induced melanocyte proliferation. The lack of correlation between the basal 5-S-CD excretion and skin type or number of melanocytes suggests that the basal 5-S-CD in urine is mainly of extra-melanocytic origin. Our findings favor the view that the increase in 5-S-CD excretion during UV irradiation is due to UV damage."
7183154	"Skin problems are common in the population. Although a substantial fraction of the population suffers from skin conditions, we still have little information on how this affects the everyday life of the individuals concerned.                                                                                   To evaluate the impact of skin disease on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) measured with the Short Form-36 (SF-36), a multidimensional generic HRQOL instrument, from an epidemiological perspective. A further aim was to study differences in HRQOL by use of non-prescription and prescription dermatological drugs.                                                                              The survey was carried out in the county of Uppland, Sweden in a random sample of 8000 individuals aged 20-84 years, of whom 5404 (68%) answered the questionnaire.                                                                              A large part of the population (20.5%) reported dermatological problems and/or use of topical dermatological drugs, with a higher frequency among women (23.3%) than men (17.3%). Persons reporting dermatological problems scored lower on all eight dimensions of the SF-36. This pattern, although weaker, persisted after adjusting for comorbid somatic as well as psychiatric diseases and complaints. Those using topical dermatological drugs on prescription generally scored lower than the other groups with skin problems: in particular, they evaluated personal health as poorer (general health perceptions), perceived more limitations in daily activities (role limitation because of emotional health problems) and felt more tired and worn out (vitality).                                                                                      The study shows that skin disorders constitute a substantial problem in the population and cause a significant decrease in HRQOL. Furthermore, the results of this population survey point out the need for further population-based studies more specifically aimed at dermatological problems and HRQOL."
6524116	"Fumaric acid esters have proved to be effective for the systemic treatment of severe psoriasis vulgaris. These compounds have been shown to induce a Th2-like cytokine secretion pattern in T cells and to reduce keratinocyte proliferation in vitro. Dendritic cells seem to be of major importance as regulatory cells driving the psoriatic tissue reaction. Monocytes or CD34-positive myeloid progenitor cells are precursors of dendritic cells that can be generated in vitro by culture with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-4. Using this model the effect of fumaric acid esters on granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor/interleukin-4-induced differentiation of monocyte-derived dendritic cells was investigated. The results of this study show that dimethylfumarate as well as methylhydrogenfumarate-calcium-salt (0.01-100 microg per ml) concentration-dependently inhibit monocyte-derived dendritic cell differentiation. This was reflected by an inhibition of CD1a, CD40, CD80, CD86, and HLA-DR expression as well as by a reduced capacity of dimethylfumarate-treated monocyte-derived dendritic cells to stimulate lymphocytes in the allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction. Other fumaric acid esters showed no effect on monocyte-derived dendritic cell-differentiation. At higher concentrations (30-100 microg per ml) dimethylfumarate, but not methylhydrogenfumarate calcium-salt induced apoptosis in monocyte-derived dendritic cells as measured by expression of Apo 2.7 and DNA fragmentation (TUNEL assay). These data point to a high susceptibility of the monocyte/dendritic cell system to dimethylfumarate and its main metabolite methylhydrogenfumarate. Other fumaric acid esters investigated were without effect. As the effects of fumarates on monocyte-derived dendritic cells observed occur at concentrations 20-fold lower compared with lymphocytes, our data seem to be of relevance in explaining the possible mode of action of these compounds in psoriasis."

Before seeing an experienced dermatologist they had to: (1) answer a short questionnaire about current signs and symptoms from the hands; and (2) state whether they had hand eczema on the day of examination. The minimum criteria for hand eczema diagnosed by the dermatologist ('gold standard') were erythema and papules or vesicles, or erythema and scaling and fissures/lichenification.                                                                              Of the 208 persons examined 93 fulfilled the criteria for hand eczema according to the 'gold standard'. Hand eczema diagnosis based on clinical signs reported in the questionnaire by the participants gave a sensitivity of 0.62 and a specificity of 0.87 in comparison with the dermatologists' diagnoses. Regarding the question about current hand eczema, agreement was good between the participants' and the dermatologists' judgements, giving a sensitivity of 0.87 and a specificity of 0.79. Comparing clinical signs reported by the participants and the findings by the dermatologists, the best agreement was for fissures, with a kappa-value of 0.65 (95% CI 0.55-0.75), and the poorest was for papules with 0.47 (95% CI 0.32-0.62).                                                                                      It was difficult for the individual to identify skin signs compatible with the clinical diagnosis of hand eczema. Asking 'Do you have hand eczema?' had high sensitivity and specificity compared to the suggested gold standard for hand eczema. However, the validity of a screening questionnaire depends on the type of population investigated."
5337993	"Over the past 10 years, the incidence of multiple myeloma (MM) has been greater among individuals >   65 years old than in younger age groups. This retrospective study of peripheral blood stem cell mobilization and harvesting examined patients of various age groups who were afflicted with this pathology. One group of 17 patients ≥65 years of age with MM (group A) were mobilized between 2002 and 2009 and compared with 33 consecutive patients of younger ages with the same diagnosis treated in 2008 and 2009 (group B). The 2 populations had a similar gender distribution; their median ages were 66 and 52 years, respectively. A successful mobilization was defined as a collection of ≥2.5 × 10(6) CD34+/kg body weight. The mobilization used filgrastim (16 μg/kg/d) with the beginning of the harvest on the fifth day. The median number of outpatient apheresis procedures per patient was 2 in group A and 1 in group B. There were no incidents or serious adverse reactions. Patients in group A collected 4.68 × 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg and for group B 3.30 × 10(6)/kg. The group A patients required a greater number of apheresis procedures to collect the appropriate graft. In conclusion, mobilization with growth factors and PHSP harvest by apheresis was safe with reasonable costs for subjects including those aged ≥65 years, resulting in an option for autologous transplantation."
6110294	"Coronary artery disease (CAD) is prevalent in patients with end-stage liver disease and associated with poor outcomes when undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT); however, noninvasive screening for CAD in this population is less sensitive. In an attempt to identify redundancy, we reviewed our experience among patients undergoing CAD screening as part of their OLT evaluation between May 2009 and February 2014. Demographic, clinical, and procedural characteristics were analyzed. Of the total number of screened patients (n = 132), initial screening was more common via stress testing (n = 100; 75.8%) than coronary angiography (n = 32; 24.2%). Most with initial stress testing underwent angiography (n = 52; 39.4%). Among those undergoing angiography, CAD was common (n = 31; 23.5%). Across the entire cohort the number of traditional risk factors was linearly associated with CAD, and those with two or more risk factors were found to have CAD by angiography 50% of the time (OR 1.92; CI 1.07-3.44, p = 0.026). Our data supports that CAD is prevalent among pre-OLT patients, especially among those with 2 or more risk factors. Moreover, we identified a lack of uniformity in practice and the need for evidence-based and standardized screening protocols."
7754407	"Hereditary syndromes frequently need the cooperation of different specialties to increase diagnostic competence. Multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomatosis syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disorder caused by the mutations of the fumarate hydratase gene, demonstrated in 80 to 100 percent of affected individuals. This can be linked to an increased risk of renal cancer in both sexes. The skin involvement is described to highlight the diagnostic role of the cutaneous counterpart in identifying this rare syndrome.                                                                                        A 37-year-old woman suffering from several uterine fibroids presented multiple, painful, papulo-nodules on her left subscapular side, both forearms and legs. The patient underwent surgery on six lesions: five were leiomyomas, whilst one was a dermatofibroma. Genetic sequencing did not evidence known fumarate hydratase gene mutations. Dermoscopy showed a brown delicate pigmented network and included leiomyomas among the non-melanocytic benign skin tumours featuring a dermatofibroma-like pattern. Abdominal computerized-tomography scan did not reveal renal cancer, but brain magnetic resonance imaging showed one asymptomatic cerebral cavernoma. The patient benefited from the surgical removal of the five larger cutaneous lesions and from gabapentin, which relieved her pain.                                                                                      This observation highlights the usefulness of dermoscopy in the diagnosis of cutaneous leiomyomas disclosing multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomatosis syndrome. Dermoscopy should be performed for non-melanocytic multiple lesions mimicking leiomyomas in a large number of patients, to establish a strict classification and identify false negative cases or evaluate them as dermatofibromas. In this case, the dermatologist recognized the risk of renal cancer and cerebral cavernomas."
5281194	"Acrokeratosis verruciformis of Hopf (AKV) is a rare genodermatosis characterized by multiple flat-topped, flesh-coloured papules on the dorsa of hands and feet, and punctuate keratoses on the palms and soles. A mutation in the ATP2A2 gene has been shown to be associated with AKV and with Darier's disease (DD).                                                                                   To explore the molecular aetiology of AKV and DD.                                                                              We investigated the clinical and histological information in two families and a sporadic case with AKV and one family and a sporadic case with DD in China. Mutation analysis of ATP2A2 was performed by PCR and direct sequencing, and genotyping and linkage analysis performed using six polymorphic microsatellite markers spanning the locus at 12q23-12q24 containing ATP2A2.                                                                              Mutational analysis showed no mutation in ATP2A2 among the AKV patients, but we found two novel mutations (p.C318F and p.M719fs) in the DD patients. The genotyping and linkage analysis results revealed no linkage evidence of the locus at 12q23-12q24 in a large AKV family.                                                                                      Our findings provide evidence for the genetic heterogeneity of AKV and demonstrate that mutations in genes other than ATP2A2 are responsible for AKV in a proportion of the Chinese population."
5257577	"Using cytotoxicity against KB cancer cells as a lead, bioguided-fractionation of the petroleum ether and ethyl acetate extracts of Bituminaria morisiana leaves led to the isolation of two new pterocarpans, namely 3,9-dihydroxy-4-(3,3-dimethylallyl) [6a R, 11a R]-pterocarpan, 3-hydroxy-4-(3,3-dimethylallyl)-4'',5''-dehydropyrano[8,9:2'',3''][6a R,11a R]-pterocarpan and one new isoflavone identified as 4',5''-dihydroxy-6''-methoxy-4'',4''-dimethyl-4'',5''-dihydro-6'' H-pyrano[2'',3'':7,8]-isoflavone. Moreover, two known pterocarpans, erybraedin C and bitucarpin A, three known isoflavones, daidzein, 8-prenyldaidzein and bidwillon C, one known furocoumarin, pseudoisopsoralen and one known coumestan, coumestrol were isolated. The structures of the isolated compounds were established by means of 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy, as well as mass spectrometry. Further cytotoxicity tests against cells related to the immune system (Jurkat T, Mono-Mac-6 and polymorphonuclear cells) showed a moderate activity of the known pterocarpan erybraedin C against all cell lines used (IC (50) values between 17.6-28.8 microM). In addition, erybraedin C was found to induce necrosis in leukaemia Jurkat T cells."
6020962	"Menkes kinky hair syndrome, also known as trichopoliodystrophy, is a rare X-linked recessive, progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized clinically by progressive psychomotor impairment, treatment-refractory seizures, and hair shaft abnormalities, most commonly pilli torti. The condition is related to a mutation in a copper transporting gene, located in the X-chromosome, resulting in deficiency of copper dependent enzymes. The diagnosis can be confirmed by a low plasma level of copper and ceruloplasmin. The prognosis of classical Menkes disease is poor. We report a case of Menkes kinky hair disease with characteristic clinical, laboratory, and radiological findings with significant macrocephaly (above 95th percentile for age). Reporting of this case is of significance because of its rarity and association with significant macrocephaly."
8065557	"Review of the literature reveals that congenital malignant melanoma is an exceptionally rare occurrence and has a generally poor prognosis when it does occur. However, benign proliferative melanocytic lesions are known to occur within giant congenital nevi (GCN). This entity is not well recognized and can be confused clinically and histologically with malignant change.                                                                                   We report 2 cases of GCN in neonates demonstrating benign proliferating nodules present at birth. An initial diagnosis of malignant melanoma was assumed in both cases. Careful histologic analysis, however, revealed these lesions to be benign, as did long-term follow-up of 3.5 years, with both patients remaining well with no evidence of melanoma. Review of the literature suggests that there are 2 clinical patterns of these benign nodules arising within GCNs: small (<   1 cm) and large (>   1 cm) dermal nodules with varying histologic patterns that we have attempted to categorize.                                                                                      Our cases illustrate the difficulty in accurate diagnosis of melanocytic lesions in the neonate. We recommend caution in making a diagnosis of malignant melanoma and highlight the possibility that benign lesions can be mistaken for melanoma in this age group. We encourage the acquisition of fixed histologic specimens for accurate diagnosis of melanocytic lesions."
9472827	"In pemphigus, autoantibodies are directed against adhesion molecules, which make the junctions between keratinocytes, and thus determining their level can reflect the disease activity.                                                                            The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical significance of the autoantibody levels in pemphigus management.                                                                                            The clinical features of 47 pemphigus vulgaris patients were assessed and patients' sera were investigated by indirect immunofluorescence using monkey esophagus as a substrate for autoantibody levels.                                                                              We found a significant correlation between antibody titers and mucosal severity scores. Initial antibody titers of the patients with at least one mucosal lesion at the end of the first month of the therapy were found significantly higher than the patients who had no mucosal lesion. With the therapy, lesions resolved earlier than the antibody titers.                                                                                     In patients with pemphigus, especially in cases who were not treated before, sera antibody levels are a valuable tool in evaluating disease severity and choosing initial treatment. In patients who had been taking any systemic treatment, it is difficult to make a relationship between antibody levels and disease severity, because therapy improves disease earlier than the antibody titers. However, estimating antibody levels can be helpful for clinicians in disease management, in reducing or ceasing treatment dosage and anticipating recurrence."
9168744	"Sebaceous carcinomas are rare cutaneous appendageal tumors that may occur sporadically or in association with an internal malignancy in Muir-Torre syndrome. In Muir-Torre syndrome microsatellite instability can often be demonstrated in tumor DNA as a result of an inherited mutation in one of several known mismatch repair genes; however, the role of microsatellite instability in sporadic sebaceous carcinomas has not been previously studied. In this report we describe the clinicopathologic characteristics of a series of unselected sebaceous carcinomas and examine them for the presence of microsatellite instability. Of 10 consecutive tumors identified over a 10 y period, only one was from a patient known to have Muir-Torre syndrome. Of the nine presumed sporadic cases, five were from four renal transplant recipients and four from otherwise healthy individuals. Microsatellite instability was demonstrable in three cases: in the Muir-Torre syndrome-associated tumor and in two tumors from transplant patients. Microsatellite instability was subsequently also found in a sebaceous carcinoma from a further transplant patient prospectively sought from another institution. The presence of microsatellite instability in post-transplant sebaceous carcinomas was associated with loss of expression of the mismatch repair protein hMSH2. In summary, sebaceous gland carcinomas, while characteristic of Muir-Torre syndrome, are commonly found outside this context. Among presumed sporadic cases, our data suggest they may be over-represented in immunosuppressed renal transplant recipients. The presence of microsatellite instability in transplant-associated lesions, together with loss of hMSH2 expression suggests that immunosuppression might unmask a previously silent Muir-Torre syndrome phenotype in some cases. Alternatively, there is experimental evidence to suggest that immunosuppressive drugs, most plausibly azathioprine, could select for the emergence of a mutator phenotype and thus predispose to the development of sebaceous carcinomas. The role of mismatch repair defects in other post-transplant skin malignancies remains to be established."
9240347	"A 14-year-old girl presented with a 1-year history of a pruritic, bullous lesion on her posterior neck. A biopsy revealed bullous lichen sclerosus. Although unusual, this bullous variant of lichen sclerosus is well recognized in the adult literature, but extragenital bullous and hemorrhagic lesions are rare in children. A review of this case and the literature describes the clinical features, pathophysiology, and treatment options for this extragenital bullous variant in an effort to raise awareness of this rare clinical presentation."
9504739	"Kyrle disease (KD) and Flegel disease (FD) are rare variants of primary perforating dermatoses, characterized by transepidermal elimination of abnormal endogenous materials. We describe a 6-year-old Yemeni girl with a 2-year history of generalized asymptomatic, small, reddish-brown keratotic papules with a lenticular central keratotic plug. Although these features are synonymous with FD, the histology of a punch biopsy was consistent with KD. The patient was otherwise healthy, and no family members had a history of similar diseases. The patient was diagnosed with KD-FD, owing to the manifestation of features associated with both diseases."
3992050	"Advances in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) technology and supportive care techniques have led to improvements in long-term survival after HCT. Emerging indications for transplantation, introduction of newer graft sources (eg, umbilical cord blood) and transplantation of older patients using less intense conditioning regimens have also contributed to an increase in the number of HCT survivors. These survivors are at risk for developing late complications secondary to pre-, peri-, and posttransplantation exposures and risk factors. Guidelines for screening and preventive practices for HCT survivors were published in 2006. An international group of transplantation experts was convened in 2011 to review contemporary literature and update the recommendations while considering the changing practice of transplantation and international applicability of these guidelines. This review provides the updated recommendations for screening and preventive practices for pediatric and adult survivors of autologous and allogeneic HCT."

Besides this, mast cell activation and degranulation have been associated with various biologically and clinically important functions. Results of the past few years suggest that mast cells are involved in the development of late-phase reactions and influence other chronic inflammatory responses through the generation and secretion of various multipotential cytokines."
3065377	"A 69-year-old woman presented with a 2-year history of an eczematous lesion covering the genital area. Histopathological examination showed deposits of amorphous, eosinophilic material and an infiltrate of plasma cells through the entire dermis into the subcutaneous fatty tissue. Congo red-stained deposits showed apple-green birefringence with polarizing microscopy. On immunohistochemistry, the deposited material was positively stained with anti-lambda light chain antibodies but not with anti-lambda light chain. A diagnosis of primary localized cutaneous amyloidosis (PLCA) was made, and the patient was also diagnosed as having Sjögren's syndrome (SjS) based on clinical and laboratory findings. The lesion of PLCA has spontaneously regressed over a period of 18 months. We report a unique case of PLCA and SjS that clinically demonstrated genital eczematous features and spontaneous involution, and we also describe a possible association between PLCA and SjS."
1205380	"Skin diseases are a common problem among young adults. There is paucity of data about it among medical students. This study aimed to find out the pattern of skin disorders and to describe their association with various socio-demographic factors among medical students.                                                                                            This cross-sectional study was conducted in June 2011 in a medical college in Mangalore, Karnataka. Two-hundred and seventy eight medical students were chosen from the 4(th), 6(th) and 8(th) semester through convenient sampling method. Data on hair and skin morbidities suffered over past 1 year and its associated factors were collected using a self-administered questionnaire.                                                                              Most of the participants 171 (61.5%) were of the age group 20-21 years and majority were females 148 (53.2%). The most common hair/skin morbidities suffered in the past one year were acne 185 (66.6%), hair loss 165 (59.3%), and sun tan 147 (52.9%). Fungal infection (P = 0.051) and severe type of acne (P = 0.041) were seen significantly more among males while hair morbidities like hair loss (P = 0.003), split ends of hairs (P <    0.0001) and dandruff (P =0.006) were seen significantly more among female students. Patterned baldness (P = 0.018) and sun tan (P <    0.0001) were significantly more among non-Mangalorean students than native Mangaloreans. Presence of dandruff was significantly associated with hair loss (P = 0.039) and usage of sunscreen was found to protect from developing sun tans (P = 0.049).                                                                                     Skin disorders, particularly the cosmetic problems are very common among medical students. Gender and place of origin were found to significantly influence the development of certain morbidities."
2865455	"Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a serious public health problem in many tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Treatment of CL can prevent disfiguring scars.                                                                            The efficacy of local heat therapy by radiofrequency (RF) was compared with intralesional injection of meglumine antimoniate in the treatment of CL.                                                                              This was a randomized clinical trial. Patients with antroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) in the Isfahan province of Iran were enrolled in the study if the examination of a smear from a suspected CL lesion was confirmed positive for Leishmania. Patients were randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups. Group A was treated by heat therapy by RF at 50 degrees C for 30 s once weekly for 4 weeks, and group B was treated with intralesional injection of meglumine antimoniate once weekly for 4 weeks. Follow-up lasted 6 months. Response to treatment was classified as complete (lesions flattened, no induration, and epidermal creases had appeared), partial (reduction in lesion size, but without the appearance of epidermal creases) and poor (no reduction in lesion size).                                                                              Of 117 participants, 57 patients with 83 lesions in group A and 60 patients with 94 lesions in group B completed the study and were followed up for 6 months. Complete, partial and poor response to treatment were 80.7%, 12% and 7.3% in group A, and 55.3%, 21.27% and 23.40% in group B, respectively (P = 0.001). In both groups, there was no relapse in patients with complete response after 6 months of follow-up.                                                                                      Heat therapy with thermogenerator RF can be used as an efficacious treatment in the lesions of CL. It is more effective than the conventional treatment with intralesional meglumine antimoniate injection."
7083945	"Melatonin and serotonin are indoleamines first identified as neurotransmitters in vertebrates; they have now been found to be ubiquitously present across all forms of life. Both melatonin and serotonin were discovered in plants several years after their discovery in mammals, but their presence has now been confirmed in almost all plant families. The mechanisms of action of melatonin and serotonin are still poorly defined. Melatonin and serotonin possess important roles in plant growth and development, including functions in chronoregulation and modulation of reproductive development, control of root and shoot organogenesis, maintenance of plant tissues, delay of senescence, and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. This review focuses on the roles of melatonin and serotonin as a novel class of plant growth regulators. Their roles in reproductive and vegetative plant growth will be examined including an overview of current hypotheses and knowledge regarding their mechanisms of action in specific responses."
8487863	"Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) pruriginosa, characterized by severe itching and the presence of nodular prurigo-like or lichenoid lesions, is a rare clinical type of dystrophic EB. Mutations in the COL7A1 gene encoding type VII collagen, the major component of anchoring fibrils, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of the disorder. In the present study, we screened a Chinese family with EB pruriginosa for COL7A1 mutations by PCR amplification of genomic sequences and direct nucleotide sequencing. The mutation consists of a G-->   T substitution at nucleotide 6724 in exon 85, which leads to the substitution of glycine by tryptophan at codon 2242. This report adds new variants to the known COL7A1 mutations underlying EB pruriginosa, and provides the basis for genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis for affected families."
1662892	"In the absence of adequate compensatory regeneration, overwhelming liver damage can cause acute liver failure (ALF) and death without emergent liver transplantation (LT). Auxiliary LT produces satisfactory outcomes in this setting, with the prospect of native liver regeneration sustaining long-term survival. Since animal models only partially recapitulate human liver regeneration, we investigated the molecular mechanisms controlling it in this unique LT setting, as an exemplar of human liver regeneration. We demonstrate coordinated changes in expression of microRNA (miRNA) during regeneration that drive proliferation, innate immunity and angiogenesis. In contrast, failed regeneration in a similar cohort is associated with distinct miRNA enforcing cell cycle inhibition and DNA methylation. The miRNA expression associated with successful or failed regeneration when recapitulated in vitro, triggered expression of cardinal regeneration-linked genes promoting cell cycle entry or inhibition, respectively. Furthermore, inhibition of miRNA 150, 663 and 503, whose downregulation is associated with successful regeneration, induced cell proliferation which a key determinant of successful regeneration. Our data indicate that human liver regeneration may be orchestrated by distinct miRNA controlling key regeneration-linked processes including hepatocyte proliferation. To our knowledge this is the first characterization of molecular processes associated with human liver regeneration."
6796770	"Due to the accumulation of evidence concerning a putative role of nitric oxide (NO) in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), we performed follow-up measurements of the stable end-products of NO, nitrite/nitrate (NO2-/NO3-) in plasma of patients undergoing allogeneic (n = 16) and autologous (n = 6, as a control) bone marrow transplantation. NO2-/NO3- concentrations were set in relation to the clinical course and to serum levels of soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 75 (sT-NFrec 75) and neopterin, both of which are known to be sensitive indicators of cellular immune activation phenomena involving macrophages in vivo, and endogenous interleukin (IL)-10, a major T helper cell type 2 (TH-2)-derived cytokine and potent inhibitor of macrophage activation and NO formation. A significant rise of NO2-/NO3- levels was observed in patients with GVHD and preceded the onset of clinical symptoms by up to 3 days. In contrast to indicators of macrophage activation, i.e., neopterin and sT-NFrec75, NO2-/NO3- concentrations were not significantly altered from baseline levels during infectious complications, as NO2-/NO3- concentrations did not fluctuate in patients after autologous engraftment. During episodes of acute GVHD, NO2-/NO3- concentrations showed a strong positive correlation with levels of plasma neopterin and sTNFrec 75, but were also significantly related to IL-10. In non-GVHD patients, a negative correlation between IL-10 and NO2-/NO3- concentrations was evident. Therefore, NO2-/NO3- determination may be a valuable early indicator of the initiation of human GVHD. Our results provide some further insights concerning cytokine-related metabolic changes in the course of human GVHD in vivo which may prove useful in the development of new therapeutic approaches for this disease."
3273134	"Despite its long history in clinical use, reported efficacy rates of griseofulvin remain highly variable. A meta-analysis of clinical trials of griseofulvin use in tinea capitis was performed to determine mean griseofulvin efficacy. A review of the literature identified 7 studies. When all 7 studies were pooled, the overall mean effective cure (negative KOH and culture) of griseofulvin at 4 to 6 weeks posttreatment was 73.4% +/- 7% (7 studies, n = 438 patients). Higher efficacy rates appeared to be reported with the use of higher dosages of griseofulvin (>    18 mg/kg/d). When broken down by species, the mean efficacy for Trichophyton and Microsporum were 67.6% +/- 9% (5 studies, n = 396) and 88.1% +/- 5% (2 studies, n = 42 patients), respectively. Based on these studies, griseofulvin efficacy has remained consistently high over the past decade. Both genera showed good efficacy with griseofulvin therapy given from 6 to 8 weeks. Griseofulvin remains an effective therapy for tinea capitis."
1145794	"Patients with vitiligo show specific losses of integumentary melanocytes, probably due to autoimmunity against melanocytes. We attempted to determine the presence of antibodies against pigment cell antigens in the sera of vitiligo patients.                                                                              Detergent-solubilized human melanoma cells were submitted to electrophoretic separation and immunoblotted against serum samples obtained from 19 patients with vitiligo and from 20 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals.                                                                              Eighty-nine per cent of patients with vitiligo had antibodies to one or more pigment cell antigens. Similar antibodies were detected in 20% of healthy individuals. Antigens of 165, 90, and 68 kDa were recognized by the antibodies present in sera from 11%, 26%, and 37% of vitiligo patients, respectively, and in none of the normal sera. All patients with familial vitiligo also had antibodies to these three proteins.                                                                                      Proteins of 165, 90, and 68 kDa are specifically recognized by antibodies present in the sera of vitiligo patients and in all patients with genetic vitiligo. Whether or not these proteins might be implicated in the destruction of melanocytes by the immune system in vitiligo remains to be evaluated."
8472967	"Although xanthogranulomas are frequently encountered by pediatricians and dermatologists, data on the course of this tumor are restricted to several series with limited follow-up. We report on our experience with 64 patients whom we were able to identify from the surgical files. Our data support the currently held view that xanthogranulomas are generally benign, self-limited lesions. They may persist or continue to erupt for years, however, particularly in individuals who develop the first lesion after age 20 years."
9149954	"Auxin is a key regulator of plant growth and development. Classical molecular and genetic techniques employed over the past 20 years identified the major players in auxin-mediated gene expression and suggest a canonical auxin response pathway. In recent years, structural and biophysical studies clarified the molecular details of auxin perception, the recognition of DNA by auxin transcription factors, and the interaction of auxin transcription factors with repressor proteins. These studies refine the auxin signal transduction model and raise new questions that increase the complexity of auxin signaling."
6674224	"We have used the photoaffinity label azido-[3H]IAA (5-N3-[7-3H]indole-3-acetic acid), a biologically active analog of indole-3-acetic acid, to identify auxin-binding proteins (ABPs) in the soluble fraction of Hyoscyamus muticus. A 25-kD polypeptide previously described (H. Macdonald, A. M. Jones, P. J. King [1991] J Biol Chem 266: 7393-7399) has now been purified to homogeneity by conventional methods. Binding of azido-[3H]IAA to the purified protein was reduced by active auxins but not by inactive indoles. Partial amino acid sequences of the purified protein showed high homology to glutathione S-transferase (GST) from tobacco (ParB) and from maize (GT32). The conclusion that the 25-kD ABP is a GST is further supported by high GST activity in fractions highly enriched in the 25-kD polypeptide and recognition of the ABP by antibodies against GST from wheat and maize. Furthermore, purification of a protein from a soluble protein extract from H. muticus by affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose also yielded a 25-kD polypeptide that was indistinguishable in its N-terminal amino acid sequence and biochemical characteristics from the protein purified by conventional methods. Possible functions of GST in auxin action are discussed."
8109785	"The present study was carried out in a 5-year-old vineyard (Vitis vinifera L., cv. Aglianico) located in Southern Italy. Half of the plants (IRR) were fully irrigated, whereas the other half were not irrigated (NIRR). In both of the treatments, plant water status, gas exchange, photosynthetic efficiency and productive performance were determined. The arid conditions resulted in significant decreases in stem water potential in NIRR (minimum values of -1.34 and -1.52 MPa in IRR and NIRR, respectively). The values of yield per plant, cluster weight and total berry weight were significantly higher in IRR. Grape berries were separated into four weight classes, and morphometric and microscopic analyses were carried out to measure and calculate berry skin characteristics. Irrigation determined a marked shift toward heavier (+23% in the class ≥ 1.25 g) and bigger (336.35 mm³ vs 299.15 mm³) berries, and induced significant changes in other morphometric berry parameters. No differences among berry weight classes and irrigation treatments were observed for berry skin thickness. In all of the berry weight classes, total anthocyanins extracted from berry skins were significantly higher in NIRR than in IRR (12301.53 and 9585.52 mg kg⁻¹ fresh berry skin, respectively), and appeared to be positively related to berry weight, whereas total flavonols were not significantly different between the two treatments. Qualitative changes in the levels of single anthocyanin and flavonol compounds were detected between IRR and NIRR. In addition, iron, copper and zinc, whose high concentration can negatively affect wine quality, were significantly higher in the IRR treatment. The results highlighted that the absence of irrigation did not determine decreases in grape quality. Such data can be of primary importance in environments where water availability is by far the most important limiting factor for plant growth."
6090182	"NADH:ubiquinone reductase (EC 1.6.19.3), or complex I, was isolated from broad bean (Vicia faba L.) mitochondria. Osmotic shock and sequential treatment with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 0.5% (w/v) [3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfate (CHAPS) removed all other NADH dehydrogenase activities. Complex I was solubilized in the presence of 4% Triton X-100 and then purified by sucrose-gradient centrifugation in the presence of the same detergent. The second purification step was hydroxylapatite chromatography. Substitution of CHAPS for Triton X-100 helped remove contaminants such as ATPase. The high molecular mass complex is composed of at least 26 subunits with molecular masses ranging from 6000 to 75,000 kD. The purified complex I reduced ferricyanide and ubiquinone analogs but not cytochrome c. NADPH could not substitute for NADH as an electron donor. The KM for NADH was 20 microM at the optimum pH of 8.0. The NH2-terminal sequence of several subunits was determined, revealing the ambiguous nature of the 42-kD subunit."
6838617	"Hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is defined as GVHD occurring within 14 days after haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT).                                                                            To evaluate the usefulness of skin biopsy in assessing hyperacute GVHD.                                                                              We examined 19 cases of hyperacute GVHD from a total of 134 consecutive HSCT cases at Shinshu University Hospital between 1999 and 2008.                                                                              Exanthemas were seen in all patients, which were mainly disseminated maculopapular erythemas, commonly present in acute GVHD as well. Most patients presented with a high fever, and a few had mild hepatic dysfunction and/or diarrhoea. The clinical grade of GVHD was 1-2 in all patients; there were no cases of clinical grades 3-4. The histological findings of skin biopsy were divided into three groups: (i) eight had grade 2 changes, characterized by diffuse vacuolization of basal cells, with dyskeratotic bodies; (ii) five had grade 1 changes, characterized by vacuolization of epidermal basal cells (all these cases were diagnosed as acute GVHD with grade 2 histological changes at subsequent biopsy); (iii) and six had no significant changes (these cases were also diagnosed as acute GVHD with grade 2 (four cases) or grade 1 (one case) histological changes on the second biopsy). Many of the patients developed acute and later chronic GVHD.                                                                                     Skin biopsy should be considered when eruption develops after HSCT even before engraftment, especially when other organ involvement is minimal. If the first skin biopsy is inconclusive, follow-up biopsy within a short time is helpful in the diagnosis of hyperacute GVHD."
6725061	"In general, metastases to the small intestine are rare, and mostly occur in melanoma. CCR9 has been shown to be the principal chemokine receptor for the thymus expressed chemokine (TECK), a chemokine selectively expressed in the small intestine and thymus. Here we show that CCR9 is highly expressed on melanoma cells and all melanoma cell lines isolated from small intestinal metastases, and on a proportion of cell lines from other sites. Only melanoma cells and cell lines from small intestinal metastases, however, were responsive to the CCR9 ligand TECK, as assessed by receptor downregulation and by actin polymerization. CCR9 expression was also found on the adenocarcinoma cell line CaCo-2 expressing characteristics of enterocytic differentiation, but not on any other cell line isolated from colorectal, breast, and lung cancer. Our data provide evidence that the aberrant functional cell surface expression of an organ-specific chemokine receptor is associated with metastasis to this site. The regulation of receptor function seems to be a critical step in the metastatic process."
1981025	"Prolonged OR, re-transplantation, and high-volume intraoperative transfusion have been associated with increased risk for IC in adult LT recipients. Antifungal prophylaxis is recommended for adult patients with these risk factors. There are limited data on the incidence of and risk factors for IC in pediatric LT recipients. A retrospective cohort study of all pediatric LT patients at the CHOP between 2000 and 2012 and the CHP between 2004 and 2012 was performed to define the incidence of IC within 30 days of LT. A 3:1 matched case-control study with incidence density sampling was performed. Conditional logistic regression analyses were used to explore risk factors associated with IC. Among 397 recipients, the incidence of IC was 2.5%. Bivariate analyses showed that ICU admission prior to transplant, OR >    10 h, intraoperative volume infusion of >   300 mL/kg, and broad-spectrum antibiotics were significantly associated with IC. In a multivariate model, only ICU admission remained significantly associated with IC. Antifungal prophylaxis was not significantly protective against IC. The low incidence of IC and lack of an identified protective effect from antifungal prophylaxis suggest that prophylaxis in pediatric LT recipients should not be routinely recommended to prevent IC events in the first 30 days post-transplant."
8279490	"Thirty-two subjects who suffered from dandruff participated in a study in which one-half of the head was washed with a shampoo containing 1% zinc pyrithione (ZPT) and the other half was washed with the same shampoo without ZPT. Four groups, eight subjects per group, were shampooed one, three, six or nine times (shampoo frequency twice per week). Clinical dandruff gradings of each half of the head were made 4 days after the last shampoo in each group, when scalp biopsy samples were also taken from each half of the head. Measurements of labelling index (LI), mean epidermal thickness (MET), and assessment of the numbers of PAS- and Gram-positive micro-organisms were made on the biopsy samples. There was a progressive reduction in dandruff on the sides of the head treated with the ZPT shampoo, the differences relative to the placebo-treated areas being statistically significant after three, six and nine washes. There were no significant differences in LI between treatment groups and the MET was shown to vary according to the treatment and the number of washes. There was a significant reduction in the number of PAS-positive micro-organisms (but not Gram-positive micro-organisms) on the ZPT-treated areas."
3334052	"Anagen effluvium develops because of disturbances in the hair follicle cycle, leading to acute and severe hair loss in humans. The objective of this study was to establish a mouse model of anagen effluvium by 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) treatment, and evaluate the pathological changes and underlying mechanisms. We treated 9-10-day-old pups and 3-7-week-old C57BL/6 mice with BrdU. After successfully inducing hair loss in the neonatal pups, microscopic, immunohistochemical and flow cytometry analyses were conducted. BrdU induced early onset alopecia in neonates and caused epidermal thickening and hair shaft breakage. BrdU appeared to incorporate the CD326-positive keratinocyte layer and induced p53-related apoptosis. Keratinocyte apoptosis caused immune cell infiltration in the dermal region; M2 macrophages and neutrophils were dominant. The BrdU-induced hair loss was dose-dependent, and alopecia was visible at a dose range of 25-200 μg/g bodyweight. The BrdU-induced anagen effluvium mouse model is novel and easily established by administrating four simple BrdU injections to pups; these mice showed synchronized onset of alopecia symptoms with little individual variation. Moreover, this model showed an alopecia phenotype similar to that of human anagen effluvium with acute, severe and widespread hair loss."
3198364	"Computer-assisted area measurement of skin lesions would be useful for the assessment of disease severity. Difficulties can be encountered, however, when lesions cannot simply be separated using the normal threshold tool of an image analyser. Owing to body curvature, peripheral sites are usually shadowed. To obtain a well-fitting curved line to account for body curvature-induced glare and shadow, we devised a simple C-programme for averaging neighbouring pixels on the same horizontal line. An image was captured from a colour slide to the image analysis system. C++ was used for programming. Execution of the averaging programme with the original image resulted in a background brightness image file. When this was subtracted from the original image, the lesions were easily detected using the standard threshold tool and the percentage of area involved was calculated. This method is sufficiently accurate for the assessment of disease severity."

These technologies include polychromatic flow cytometry, mass cytometry, highly multiplexed single cell qPCR, RNA sequencing, microtools, and high-resolution imaging. In this article, we review these platforms, describing their power and limitations for comprehensive analysis of the immune system. We relate the properties of these technologies to the various cellular states relevant to an immune response, in order to address which technologies are most appropriate for which settings."
4392014	"The findings and recommendations of the North American consensus conference on training in hepatopancreaticobiliary (HPB) surgery held in October 2014 are presented. The conference was hosted by the Society for Surgical Oncology (SSO), the Americas Hepato-Pancreatico-Biliary Association (AHPBA), and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons (ASTS). The current state of training in HPB surgery in North America was defined through three pathways-HPB, surgical oncology, and solid organ transplant fellowships. Consensus regarding programmatic requirements included establishment of minimum case volumes and inclusion of quality metrics. Formative assessment, using milestones as a framework and inclusive of both operative and nonoperative skills, must be present. Specific core HPB cases should be defined and used for evaluation of operative skills. The conference concluded with a focus on the optimal means to perform summative assessment to evaluate the individual fellow completing a fellowship in HPB surgery. Presentations from the hospital perspective and the American Board of Surgery led to consensus that summative assessment was desired by the public and the hospital systems and should occur in a uniform but possibly modular manner for all HPB fellowship pathways. A task force composed of representatives of the SSO, AHPBA, and ASTS are charged with implementation of the consensus statements emanating from this consensus conference."
7568838	"The phytopathogenic fungi Magnaporthe grisea and Alternaria alternata produce melanin via the polyketide biosynthesis, and both fungi form melanized colonies. However, the site of melanin deposition and the role of melanin in pathogenicity differ between these two fungi. M. grisea accumulates melanin in appressoria, and their melanization is essential for host penetration. On the other hand, A. alternata produces colorless appressoria, and melanin is not relevant to host penetration. We examined whether the melanin biosynthesis genes of A. alternata could complement the melanin-deficient mutations of M. grisea. Melanin-deficient, nonpathogenic mutants of M. grisea, albino (Alb-), rosy (Rsy-), and buff (Buf-), were successfully transformed with a cosmid clone pMRB1 that carries melanin biosynthesis genes ALM, BRM1, and BRM2 of A. alternata. This transformation restored the melanin synthesis of the Alb- and Buf- mutants, but not that of the Rsy- mutant. The melanin-restored transformants regained mycelial melanization, appressorium melanization, and pathogenicity to rice. Further, transformation of Alb- and Buf- mutants with subcloned ALM and BRM2 genes, respectively, also produced melanin-restored transformants. These results indicate that the Alternaria genes ALM and BRM2 can restore pathogenicity to the mutants Alb- and Buf-, respectively, due to their function during appressorium development in M. grisea."
2735557	"The risk and outcome in patients undergoing left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation on an emergency basis is still unclear.                                                                              Since April 1993, 40 patients received a Novacor and 8 patients a Heartmate LVAD in our institution. Patients with emergency LVAD placement were compared with the remainder in a retrospective manner. Parameters studied included underlying heart disease, preimplantation dysfunction of kidney, liver, lung, and cerebrum, interval of mechanical support, outcome, and complications.                                                                              Patients with emergency LVAD placement predominantly were seen with postcardiotomy heart failure (47%) or acute myocarditis (20%) (group A) whereas elective and urgent candidates for LVAD implantation mainly had dilative cardiomyopathy (67%) or ischemic heart disease (30%) (group B). The incidence of secondary organ failure was significantly higher for all organs in group A patients (p <    .01). Mean support interval in patients who underwent emergency LVAD implantation was lower (74+/-79 days vs 115+/-80 days), and fewer patients could be forwarded to heart transplantation in this group (22% vs 78%, p <    .01). Moreover, bleeding complications were increased in group A (66% vs 30%, p <    .01), but not thromboembolism and infection.                                                                                     In conclusion, the overall success rate after emergency LVAD implantation was lower, with bleeding being the most frequent complication. To achieve acceptable outcomes in disastrous situations, LVADs should be placed as early as possible."
8554964	"Biliary strictures remain the most challenging aspect of adult right lobe living donor liver transplantation (RLDLT). Between 04/2000 and 10/2005, 130 consecutive RLDLTs were performed in our center and followed prospectively. Median follow-up was 23 months (range 3-67) and 1-year graft and patient survival was 85% and 87%, respectively. Overall incidence of biliary leaks (n = 19) or strictures (n = 22) was 32% (41/128) in 33 patients (26%). A duct-to-duct (D-D) or Roux-en-Y (R-Y) anastomosis were performed equally (n = 64 each) with no difference in stricture rate (p = 0.31). The use of ductoplasty increased the number of grafts with a single duct for anastomosis and reduced the biliary complication rate compared to grafts >   /=2 ducts (17% vs. 46%; p = 0.02). Independent risk factors for strictures included older donor age and previous history of a bile leak. All strictures were managed nonsurgically initially but four patients ultimately required conversion from D-D to R-Y. Ninety-six percent (123/128) of patients are currently free of any biliary complications. D-D anastomosis is safe after RLDLT and provides access for future endoscopic therapy in cases of leak or stricture. When presented with multiple bile ducts, ductoplasty should be considered to reduce the potential chance of stricture."

5040352	"Experimental and clinical evidence has demonstrated that the establishment of allogeneic chimerism after bone marrow transplantation may provide donor-specific tolerance for solid organ allografts.                                                                              Based on the preliminary results of a clinical trial using nonmyeloablative preparative therapy for the induction of mixed lymphohematopoietic chimerism, we treated a 55-year-old woman with end stage renal disease secondary to multiple myeloma with a combined histocompatibility leukocyte antigen-matched bone marrow and renal transplant after conditioning with cyclophosphamide, antithymocyte globulin, and thymic irradiation.                                                                              The posttransplant course was notable for early normalization of renal function, the absence of acute graft-versus-host disease, and the establishment of mixed lymphohematopoietic chimerism. Cyclosporine, which was the only posttransplant immunosuppressive therapy, was tapered and discontinued on day +73 posttransplant. No rejection episodes occurred, and renal function remains normal on day + 170 posttransplant (14 weeks after discontinuing cyclosporine). Although there is presently no evidence of donor hematopoiesis, there is evidence of an ongoing antitumor response with a recent staging evaluation showing no measurable urine kappa light chains. The patient remains clinically well and is off all immunosuppressive therapy.                                                                                     This is the first report of the deliberate induction of mixed lymphohematopoietic chimerism after a nonmyeloablative preparative regimen to treat a hematological malignancy and to provide allotolerance for a solid organ transplant."

We performed a retrospective study of patients meeting delusional infestation criteria who were seen for diagnosis and treatment in our tertiary care academic medical center (2001-2007). Medical records were reviewed to abstract demographic, historical, and physical findings and treatment.                                                                              Over 7 years, 147 patients presented with delusional infestation; 87% (123/142) for another opinion. Mean age was 57 years; female-to-male ratio was 2.89 to 1; 82 (56%) were married. Mean duration of symptoms was 31 months. Employment data were available for 145 patients: 48 (33%) were self-described as disabled, 16 of whom cited delusions as their disability; 41 (28%) were retired; and 38 (26%) were employed. Reported infestations included multiple materials (45% [64/143]), not limited to insects (79% [113/143]), worms (27% [39/143]), and fibers (20% [29/143]). Most patients presented initially to dermatology or other specialties; only 3 presented to psychiatry. A high proportion (81%) had prior psychiatric conditions. Thirty-eight (26%) of the 147 patients had a shared psychotic disorder.

1569788	"Interstitial edema of rejecting tissue can be partly attributed to the local accumulation of hyaluronan, which has strong water-binding capacity. The aim of the present study was to isolate fibroblasts from rejecting tissue and compare them, in terms of hyaluronan production and proliferation rate, with fibroblasts obtained from nontransplanted tissue. Furthermore, the fibroblast response to various cytokines involved in the rejection process was studied.                                                                              Fibroblasts were isolated from normal rat heart tissue and from cardiac allografts undergoing rejection. The various preparations were characterized with regard to hyaluronan production (radiometric assay) and cell proliferation ( H-thymidine incorporation). In addition, the effects of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interferon (IFN)-gamma, and interleukin (IL)-2 on these parameters were studied.                                                                              Fibroblasts isolated from rejecting hearts displayed strongly up-regulated hyaluronan production and proliferation rate as compared with fibroblasts obtained from normal tissue. In the presence of TNF-alpha, the proliferation of nonconfluent cells was augmented, whereas in confluent cultures of fibroblasts from rejecting tissue, the proliferation was inhibited. IFN-gamma stimulated both hyaluronan secretion and proliferation in confluent fibroblasts from rejecting hearts but had no effect on fibroblasts from normal tissue. IL-2, finally, reduced the hyaluronan production of nonconfluent cells.                                                                                      The activation of fibroblasts is increased in rejecting tissue. As a result, the hyaluronan concentration is elevated which, in vivo, contributes to the formation of an interstitial edema and a subsequently increased tissue pressure. Several cytokines present at rejection are involved also in the regulation of fibroblast activity."

In contrast, the mRNA expression of IL-17B and IL-17D was significantly decreased in lesional compared with nonlesional skin, while IL-17E mRNA was undetectable. The increased mRNA expression of IL-17A, IL-17C and IL-17F was paralleled by an increased protein accumulation of these cytokines in psoriatic skin. Analysis of the IL-17R mRNA expression revealed significantly impaired mRNA expression of IL-17RB, IL-17RC, IL-17RD and IL-17RE in lesional psoriatic skin, whereas the mRNA expression of IL-17RA was similar in lesional and nonlesional psoriatic skin.                                                                                      This study characterizes the mRNA profile of the IL-17 isoforms and receptors in psoriatic skin lesions. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time augmented protein levels of IL-17A, IL-17C and IL-17F in psoriatic skin lesions, indicating a possible role for IL-17C in addition to IL-17A and IL-17F in the pathogenesis of psoriasis."
4553167	"Developments increasing our understanding of chronic urticaria have resulted in the simplification and improvement of available treatments. Currently, many treatments target mast cell mediators, but we can now disrupt mast cell activation with the anti-IgE antibody omalizumab, which has markedly advanced the treatment landscape for patients with difficult-to-treat urticaria. Current guidelines provide a framework for the management and treatment of patients with CU but, as each patient is different, knowledge and experience of specialist dermatologists and allergists are key to effective pharmacotherapy. This article reviews the different therapeutic options for patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (also called chronic idiopathic urticaria) or chronic inducible urticaria and discusses management of special populations or special circumstances related to CU."
1625958	"Jatropha curcas L. is a small, woody tree of the Euphorbiaceae family. This plant can grow on marginal land in the tropical and subtropical regions and produces seeds containing up to 30% oil. Several Asian countries have selected Jatropha for large scale planting as a biodiesel feedstock. Nevertheless, Jatropha also possesses several undesirable traits that may limit its wide adoption. An improved understanding of plant development and the regulation of fatty acid (FA) and triacylglyceride biosynthesis in Jatropha is particularly facilitative for the development of elite crops. Here, we show that a tobacco rattle virus (TRV) vector can trigger virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) in Jatropha. Our optimized method produced robust and reliable gene silencing in plants agroinoculated with recombinant TRV harbouring Jatropha gene sequences. We used VIGS to investigate possible functions of 13 Jatropha genes of several functional categories, including FA biosynthesis, developmental regulation and toxin biosynthesis, etc. Based on the effects of VIGS on the FA composition of newly emerged leaves, we determined the function of several genes implicated in FA biosynthesis. Moreover, VIGS was able to discriminate independent functions of related gene family members. Our results show that VIGS can be used for high-throughput screening of Jatropha genes whose functions can be assayed in leaves."
2790237	"In adults, hematopoiesis takes places in the bone marrow, where specialized niches containing mesenchymal nonhematopoietic cells (stroma) harbor the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC). These niches are responsible and essential for the maintenance of HSCs. Attempts to expand HSCs fail to  keep the general properties of stem cells, which depend on several niche components difficult to reproduce in in vitro culture systems. Here, we describe a methodology for in vivo study of hematopoietic stroma. We use stroma-loaded macroporous microcarriers implanted in the subcutaneous tissue  of experimental animals and show that the ectopic stroma implant (ESI) is able to support hematopoiesis. Moreover, lethally irradiated mice can be rescued by ESI preloaded with HSCs, showing that they function as an ectopic bone marrow. ESI is also shown as a good system to study the role  of different niche components. As an example, we used stromas lacking connexin 43 (Cx43) and confirm the importance of this molecule in the maintenance of the HSC niche in vivo. We believe ESI can work as an ectopic bone marrow allowing in vivo testing of different niches components and opening  new avenues for the treatment of a variety of hematologic conditions particularly when stromal cell defects are the main cause of disease."
6241124	"Skin adnexal tumors are daunting diagnostic problems. Cytologic atypia does not always imply malignancy and ""typia"" does not underscore a benign course. Bernard Ackerman first described criteria on silhouettes that enable distinction between the two.                                                                             To evaluate the histologic features on silhouettes of benign and malignant skin adnexal tumors. To identify overlaps and confounding features.                                                                                            A blinded retrospective review of all skin adnexal neoplasms between 1995 and 2007 was done, with a total of 68 cases. We studied 16 histologic parameters on scanner view and categorized them as benign or malignant. They were compared with the final histologic diagnosis. Statistical analysis was performed using chi-square test.                                                                              15 criteria attained statistical significance. Features that proved highly sensitive and specific were: Circumscription, ulceration, uniform size of cell aggregates, discrete arrangement, preserved adnexae and necrosis. Criteria that were sensitive but not very specific include: Symmetry, V-shape, vertical orientation, smooth margins, compressed fibrous tissue, type of clefting, shelling out and geometric shapes. Presence of epithelial cells in singles was not helpful.                                                                                     Malignant skin adnexal tumors are differentiated accurately from benign ones by their contrasting silhouettes. Pathologists should heed the impression formed on scanner view, before evaluating cytologic features."
8677486	"Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a highly aggressive neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin. The incidence of this rare tumor is increasing rapidly; the American Cancer Society estimates for 2008 almost 1500 new cases in the U.S. Thus, the incidence of MCC will exceed the incidence of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Moreover, the mortality rate of MCC with 33% is considerably higher than that of cutaneous melanoma. These clinical observations are especially disturbing as we are only recently beginning to understand the pathogenesis of MCC. For the same reason, the therapeutic approach is often unclear; reliable data are only available for the therapy of locoregional disease."
2235540	"A central goal of green chemistry is to produce industrially useful fatty acids in oilseed crops. Although genes encoding suitable fatty acid-modifying enzymes are available from many wild species, progress has been limited because the expression of these genes in transgenic plants produces low yields of the desired products. For example, Ricinus communis fatty acid hydroxylase 12 (FAH12) produces a maximum of only 17% hydroxy fatty acids (HFAs) when expressed in Arabidopsis. cDNA clones encoding R. communis enzymes for additional steps in the seed oil biosynthetic pathway were identified. Expression of these cDNAs in FAH12 transgenic plants revealed that the R. communis type-2 acyl-coenzyme A:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (RcDGAT2) could increase HFAs from 17% to nearly 30%. Detailed comparisons of seed neutral lipids from the single- and double-transgenic lines indicated that RcDGAT2 substantially modified the triacylglycerol (TAG) pool, with significant increases in most of the major TAG species observed in native castor bean oil. These data suggest that RcDGAT2 prefers acyl-coenzyme A and diacylglycerol substrates containing HFAs, and biochemical analyses of RcDGAT2 expressed in yeast cells confirmed a strong preference for HFA-containing diacylglycerol substrates. Our results demonstrate that pathway engineering approaches can be used successfully to increase the yields of industrial feedstocks in plants, and that members of the DGAT2 gene family probably play a key role in this process."
7029401	"A 9-year-old female, domestic short hair cat was presented with sudden onset of polyuria/polydipsia, and hundreds of cutaneous nodules. Prior to referral, the cat had had four skin nodules that were treated with steroids. The four skin nodules then multiplied to form more than 100 ulcerated and nonulcerated nodules located all over the trunk. Clinical evaluation revealed hypothermia and respiratory distress. Cytology from both skin nodules and bronchoalveolar lavage showed macrophages and small organisms whose shape and size were indicative of Toxoplasma spp., or similar organisms. Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) serology results were negative. The cat was seropositive for Toxoplasma (IgG 1 : 640) and Neospora (1 : 80) infections. The cat died soon after referral. Necropsy revealed pyothorax, necrotic/purulent pneumonia, haemorrhagic spots on kidneys and mesentery. Histopathology from skin nodules showed diffuse, deep necrotic dermatitis/panniculitis, vasculitis and disseminated free and grouped protozoa. The parasites were found in lungs, spleen, kidneys and liver. Immunohistochemistry on skin tissue with anti-Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum antibodies gave positive results with both. Electron microscopy showed single and grouped tachyzoites with morphological features of T. gondii, often within macrophages. Samples of cutaneous nodules and bronchoalveolar fluid were examined by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for detecting apicomplexa coccidia. PCR results were consistent only with T. gondii infection. Therefore, immunohistochemistry positivity for N. caninum was considered a cross-reaction and a diagnosis of cutaneous and visceral toxoplasmosis was made."
3019184	"Programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) compromises cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific T-cell responses and has been linked to CMV viremia after transplantation. An impaired functional and proliferative capacity of PD-1-positive CMV-specific T cells may be reversed by the antibody-mediated blockade of PD-1 signaling. However, knowledge is limited on changes in ""cytokinome"" expression profiles associated with reversal of functional exhaustion.                                                                              The ""cytokinome"" was analyzed by 27-plex Luminex technology comparing renal transplant recipients with low (n = 5) and high (n = 5) PD-1 expression on CMV-specific T cells. The effect of blocking PD-1 by PD-ligand (PD-L) antibodies on restoration of cytokine expression was examined.                                                                              CMV-specific cytokine release and proliferation was lower in patients with high PD-1 expression on CMV-specific T cells. Antibody-mediated blockade of PD-L in CMV-stimulated samples restored expression levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, interferon-γ, macrophage inflammatory protein-1α, and tumor necrosis factor-α. By contrast, no profound effect was observed for controls or patients with low PD-1 expression, or in staphylococcal enterotoxin B-stimulated cells.                                                                                     Taken together, this pilot study provides evidence that a high PD-1 expression on CMV-specific T cells actively impairs proliferation and ""cytokinome"" responses in an antigen-specific manner. Importantly, blockade of PD-L restores CMV-specific T-cell proliferation and expression of a panel of different proinflammatory and/or type 1 cytokines, suggesting a common but as yet unknown regulatory principle. We conclude that PD-1 exhaustion is reversible and potentially amenable to therapeutic ex vivo and possibly in vivo manipulation. However, detailed knowledge of the differential effects on the ""cytokinome"" will be necessary to increase the safety and the efficacy of such manipulations."

We report a case of squamous cell carcinoma, which arose in a skin graft used for resurfacing a scalp defect. The defect followed the excision of a basal cell carcinoma 11 years previously. The excision was incomplete and radiotherapy had been given. The possible pathological mechanisms for the development of a squamous cell carcinoma in transplanted skin are discussed."
8827115	"Ethanol (EtOH), isopropyl alcohol (IPA), and propylene glycol (PG) increase topical drug delivery, but are sometimes associated with erythema. A potential genetic basis for alcohol-associated erythema was investigated as the function of polymorphisms in coding and non-coding regions of class IB alcohol dehydrogenase (ADHIB) and evaluated for altered gene expression in vitro and metabolic activity in vivo via altered skin blood flow (Doppler velocimeter) and erythema (reflectance colorimeter a*) following topical challenge to 5 M EtOH, IPA, PG, and butanol (ButOH). Promoter polymorphisms G-887A and C-739T and exon G143A form eight ADHIB haplotypes with different frequencies in Caucasians vs Asians and exhibit variable gene expression and metabolic activity. Polymorphisms C-739T and G-887A independently alter gene expression, which is further increased by IPA and PG, but not EtOH or ButOH. EtOH and ButOH increase erythema as a function of skin blood flow. IPA increases skin blood flow without erythema and PG increased erythema with decreased skin blood flow, all as a function of ADHIB haplotype. PG-induced erythema was uniquely associated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression. Thus, erythema following alcohol exposure is alcohol type specific, has a pharmacogenetic basis related to ADHIB haplotype and can be functionally evaluated via Doppler velocimetry and reflectance colorimetry in vivo."

7140469	"Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice to restore fertility to women on renal replacement therapy. Over time, immunosuppressive, support therapies and approaches towards high-risk pregnancies have changed. The aim of this study was to analyse maternal-foetal outcomes in two cohorts of transplanted women who delivered a live-born baby in Italy in 1978-2013, dichotomized into delivery before and after January 2000.                                                                              A survey involving all the Italian transplant centres was carried out, gathering data on all pregnancies recorded since the start of activity at each centre; the estimated nationwide coverage was 75%. Data on cause of ESRD, dialysis, living/cadaveric transplantation, drug therapy, comorbidity, and the main maternal-foetal outcomes were recorded and reviewed. Data were compared with a low-risk cohort of pregnancies from two large Italian centres (2000-14; Torino and Cagliari Observational Study cohort).                                                                              The database consists of 222 pregnancies with live-born babies after transplantation (83 before 2000 and 139 in 2000-13; 68 and 121 with baseline and birth data, respectively), and 1418 low-risk controls. The age of the patients significantly increased over time (1978-99: age 30.7 ± 3.7 versus 34.1 ± 3.7 in 2000-13; P <    0.001). Azathioprine, steroids and cyclosporine A were the main drugs employed in the first time period, while tacrolimus emerged in the second. The prevalence of early preterm babies increased from 13.4% in the first to 27.1% in the second period (P = 0.049), while late-preterm babies non-significantly decreased (38.8 versus 33.1%), thus leaving the prevalence of all preterm babies almost unchanged (52.2 and 60.2%; P = 0.372). Babies below the 5th percentile decreased over time (22.2 versus 9.6%; P = 0.036). In spite of high prematurity rates, no neonatal deaths occurred after 2000. The results in kidney transplant patients are significantly different from controls both considering all cases [preterm delivery: 57.3 versus 6.3%; early preterm: 22.2 versus 0.9%; small for gestational age (SGA): 14 versus 4.5%; P <    0.001] and considering only transplant patients with normal kidney function [preterm delivery: 35 versus 6.3%; early preterm: 10 versus 0.9%; SGA: 23.7 versus 4.5% (P <    0.001); risks increase across CKD stages]. Kidney function remained stable in most of the patients up to 6 months after delivery. Multiple regression analysis performed on the transplant cohort highlights a higher risk of preterm delivery in later CKD stages, an increase in preterm delivery and a decrease in SGA across periods.                                                                                      Pregnancy after transplantation has a higher risk of adverse outcomes compared with the general population. Over time, the incidence of SGA babies decreased while the incidence of 'early preterm' babies increased. Although acknowledging the differences in therapy (cyclosporine versus tacrolimus) and in maternal age (significantly increased), the decrease in SGA and the increase in prematurity may be explained by an obstetric policy favouring earlier delivery against the risk of foetal growth restriction."

5803298	"The study aims to provide a theoretical guidance of postmaxillary implant in the augmented sinus without grafting materials by establishing a three-dimensional model of this new implant restorative technique, evaluating failure risk of sinus augmentation without grafting materials of different alveolar ridge heights, and analyzing stress distribution of different healing stage.                                                                                            Seventeen three-dimensional finite element models of a posterior maxillary region with sinus mucosa and different elevation heights were constructed according to anatomical data of sinus area, and the standard implant model based on Nobel Biocare implant system were created via computer-aided design software. All materials were assumed to be isotropic and linearly elastic. Axial force of 150 N was applied. The von Mises stress, stress distribution, and implant displacement were calculated with software.                                                                              With the height of the alveolar ridge reducing, the maximum von Mises stress of tissues and the displacement of the implant are on the rise, especially when the height of the bone is less than 7 mm. When the height decreased to 4 mm, the data may be doubled. After the stiff callus stage, the stress and displacement were close to the control model.                                                                                     For maxillary sinus augmentation without grafting material implant technique, the stress of different tissues and the displacement of the implant were not increased much when the height of alveolar ridge is more than 7 mm. But if the alveolar bone height is less than 4 mm, this implant technique is not suggested. Immediately loading is not suggested and the loading opportunity should be after the stiff callus stage at least to improve the success rate."
6251254	"Fibronectin (FN) is required for embryogenesis, morphogenesis, and wound repair, and its Arg-Gly-Asp-containing central cell-binding domain (CCBD) is essential for mesenchymal cell survival and growth. Here, we demonstrate that FN contains three growth factor-binding domains (FN-GFBDs) that bind platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), a potent fibroblast survival and mitogenic factor. These sites bind PDGF-BB with dissociation constants of 10-100 nM. FN-null cells cultured on recombinant CCBD (FNIII(8-11)) without a FN-GFBD demonstrated minimal metabolism and underwent autophagy at 24 hours, followed by apoptosis at 72 hours, even in the presence of PDGF-BB. In contrast, FN-null cells plated on FNIII(8-11) contiguous with FN-GFBD survived without, and proliferated with, PDGF-BB. FN-null cell survival on FNIII(8-11) and noncontiguous arrays of FN-GFBDs required these domains to be adsorbed on the same surface, suggesting the existence of a mesenchymal cell-extracellular matrix synapse. Thus, fibroblast survival required GF stimulation in the presence of a FN-GFBD, as well as adhesion to FN through the CCBD. The findings that fibroblast survival is dependent on FN-GFBD underscore the critical importance of pericellular matrix for cell survival and have significant implications for cutaneous wound healing and regeneration."
3444524	"Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a hereditary mechanobullous disease of animals and humans, characterized by an extreme fragility of the skin and mucous membranes. The main feature of EB in humans and animals is the formation of blisters and erosions in response to minor mechanical trauma. Epidermolysis bullosa is caused by mutations in the genes that code for structural proteins of the cytoskeleton of the basal keratinocytes or of the basement membrane zone. Based on the ultrastructural levels of tissue separation, EB is divided into the following three broad categories: epidermolysis bullosa simplex, junctional epidermolysis bullosa and dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. Human types of EB are divided into several subtypes based on their ultrastructural changes and the mode of inheritance; subtypes are not fully established in animals. In humans, it is estimated that EB affects one in 17,000 live births; the frequency of EB in different animals species is not known. In all animal species, except in buffalo with epidermolysis bullosa simplex, multifocal ulcers are observed on the gums, hard and soft palates, mucosa of the lips, cheek mucosa and dorsum of the tongue. Dystrophic or absent nails, a frequent sign seen in human patients with EB, corresponds to the deformities and sloughing of the hooves in ungulates and to dystrophy or atrophy of the claws in dogs and cats. This review covers aspects of the molecular biology, diagnosis, classification, clinical signs and pathology of EB reported in animals."
7645560	"Approximately 2 million chronic haemodialysis patients produce over 2,000,000 tons of waste per year that includes about 600,000 tons of potentially hazardous waste. The aim of the present study was to analyse the characteristics of the waste that is produced through chronic haemodialysis in an effort to identify strategies to reduce its environmental and financial impact.                                                                              The study included three dialysis machines and disposables for bicarbonate dialysis, haemodiafiltration (HFR) and lactate dialysis. Hazardous waste is defined as waste that comes into contact with bodily fluids. The weight and cost of waste management was evaluated by various policies of differentiation, ranging from a careful-optimal differentiation to a careless one. The amount of time needed for optimal management was recorded in 30 dialysis sessions. Non-hazardous materials were assessed for potential recycling.                                                                              The amount of plastic waste that is produced per dialysis session ranges from 1.5 to 8 kg (from 1.1 to 8 kg of potentially hazardous waste), depending upon the type of dialysis machine and supplies, differentiation and emptying policies. The financial cost of waste disposal is high, and is mainly related to hazardous waste disposal, with costs ranging from 2.2 to 16 Euro per session (2.7-21 USD) depending on the waste management policy. The average amount of time needed for careful, optimal differentiation disposal is approximately 1 minute for a haemodialysis session and 2 minutes for HFR. The ecological cost is likewise high: less than one-third of non-hazardous waste (23-28%) is potentially recyclable, while the use of different types of plastic, glues, inks and labels prevents the remaining materials from being recycled.                                                                                     Acknowledging the problem of waste management in dialysis could lead to savings of hundreds of millions of Dollars and to the reuse and recycling of hundreds of tons of plastic waste per year on a world-wide scale with considerable financial and ecological savings."
6958807	"A case of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) with low expression of the adhesion molecules lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and very late antigen-4 (VLA-4) is described. The patient was a 90-year-old man with red round homogeneous tumors on his scalp, trunk, and extremities. He had no history of definite erythema or plaque stage. A biopsy sample taken from a tumor revealed massive infiltration of atypical lymphocytes in the reticular dermis and subcutis with a definite clear zone. The atypical lymphocytes were medium-sized with slightly convoluted nuclei. Immunohistochemically, the infiltrates showed the phenotype of so-called memory T cells. On the basis of these features, the case was diagnosed as CTCL. Expression of LFA-1, ICAM-1 and VLA-4 on the infiltrates was 9%, 13% and 11%, respectively, which is much lower than that in classic mycosis fungoides. This finding suggests that loss of these adhesion molecules may contribute to loss of epidermotropism in the advanced stage of CTCL."
1083680	"Acne vulgaris is a dynamic, complex condition that is notoriously difficult to evaluate. The authors set out to critically evaluate currently available measures of acne severity, particularly in terms of suitability for use in clinical trials.                                                                             A systematic review was conducted to identify methods used to measure acne severity, using MEDLINE, CINAHL, Scopus, and Wiley Online. Each method was critically reviewed and given a score out of 13 based on eight quality criteria under two broad groupings of psychometric testing and suitability for research and evaluation.                                                                              Twenty-four methods for assessing acne severity were identified. Four scales received a quality score of zero, and 11 scored ≤3. The highest rated scales achieved a total score of 6. Six scales reported strong inter-rater reliability (ICC>   0.75), and four reported strong intra-rater reliability (ICC>   0.75). The poor overall performance of most scales, largely characterized by the absence of reliability testing or evidence for independent assessment and validation indicates that generally, their application in clinical trials is not supported.                                                                                     This review and appraisal of instruments for measuring acne severity supports previously identified concerns regarding the quality of published measures. It highlights the need for a valid and reliable acne severity scale, especially for use in research and evaluation. The ideal scale would demonstrate adequate validation and reliability and be easily implemented for third-party analysis. The development of such a scale is critical to interpreting results of trials and facilitating the pooling of results for systematic reviews and meta-analyses."
8202734	"We describe a 34-year-old kidney transplant patient who developed a distinct cutaneous side-effect to cyclosporine manifested as an infiltrated appearance to the skin with abundant flesh-colored, follicular papules predominantly affecting the ears, nose, and surrounding areas of the face, but also the trunk and extremities. The clinical and histologic findings in this case closely match those presented in 2 previous case reports, in which immunosuppressive doses of cyclosporine appeared to be causative. We present a detailed report of the clinical and histologic findings that are unique to these 3 cases and we introduce a theory, based on the recent in vitro studies involving cyclosporine, to help explain the pathogenic events induced by cyclosporine in these patients. We propose the term ""cyclosporine induced folliculodystrophy"" or CIF as an appropriate name for this distinct clinicohistopathologic entity. Finally, we set forth 3 clinical and 4 histopathologic criteria upon which the diagnosis of CIF can be made."
7733744	"Acne fulminans is characterized by the sudden onset of a severe, ulcerative acne associated with systemic features. Response to traditional acne therapies is poor. We have recognized a subset of patients with acne of a severity comparable to that of acne fulminans but with the absence of systemic involvement; we suggest modification of the treatment regimes used in this group."
6867940	"Nodular cutaneous amyloidosis (NCA) is the rarest form of primary cutaneous amyloidosis. The amyloid fibrils of NCA are not unique to NCA but are also the prevailing amyloid component in primary systemic amyloidosis (PSA) and myeloma-associated systemic amyloidosis. Age of presentation in NCA has ranged from 20 to 87 years without a clear gender predilection. Progression from NCA to primary systemic amyloidosis has been reported, with an estimated lifetime risk of approximately 7 percent, prompting the need for appropriate follow up to evaluate for the presence of systemic amyloidosis. We report a case of nodular cutaneous amyloidosis in an otherwise healthy 62-year-old woman and we review the literature."
6223898	"Skin cancer is the most common malignancy occurring after kidney transplantation.                                                                                  Our purpose was to identify the skin problems of kidney transplant recipients, the extent of their awareness of skin cancer, and interest in skin cancer screenings.                                                                              One hundred twenty-two patients were administered an oral questionnaire during regular follow-up at a renal transplant clinic.                                                                              The average time from transplantation was 3.1 years. Thirty-nine percent of patients reported skin problems, including warts, fungal infection, and skin cancer. Forty-one percent of patients were unable to recall specific skin cancer education, and 52% expressed an interest in skin cancer screening. Twenty-seven percent of patients had seen a dermatologist since their transplant, but only 14% were followed up regularly by a dermatologist.                                                                                     We believe the need for continuing skin cancer education and early detection and treatment of skin lesions establishes an important role for the dermatologist on the transplant recipient's health care team."
4073579	"Calcium ions are considered ubiquitous second messengers in eukaryotic signal transduction pathways. Intracellular Ca(2+) concentration are modulated by various signals such as hormones and biotic and abiotic stresses. Modulation of Ca(2+) ion leads to stimulation of calcium dependent protein kinase genes (CPKs), which results in regulation of gene expression and therefore mediates plant growth and development as well as biotic and abiotic stresses. Here, we reported the CPK gene family of 40 different plant species (950 CPK genes) and provided a unified nomenclature system for all of them. In addition, we analyzed their genomic, biochemical and structural conserved features. Multiple sequence alignment revealed that the kinase domain, auto-inhibitory domain and EF-hands regions of regulatory domains are highly conserved in nature. Additionally, the EF-hand domains of higher plants were found to contain four D-x-D and two D-E-L motifs, while lower eukaryotic plants had two D-x-D and one D-x-E motifs in their EF-hands. Phylogenetic analysis showed that CPK genes are clustered into four different groups. By studying the CPK gene family across the plant lineage, we provide the first evidence of the presence of D-x-D motif in the calcium binding EF-hand domain of CPK proteins."
3750750	"The renal benefits of agents inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in renal transplant recipients, i.e. preventing the development of chronic graft nephropathy, are supposed but not finally proven. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, we evaluated the influence of losartan on surrogate markers of tubular injury, urine excretion of transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-beta1) and amino-terminal propeptide of type III procollagen (PIIINP) in 16 patients after transplantation. The patients received randomly either losartan (50-100 mg daily) or the beta-blocker carvedilol (12.5-25 mg) for 8 weeks, allowing a placebo washout between treatments. The target office through blood pressure (BP) was below 130/85 mmHg. The BP did not differ in the treatment periods. Losartan significantly decreased N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase and alfa-1 microglobulin excretion relative to placebo and carvedilol. Urine excretion of TGF-beta1 and PIIINP was significantly lower after losartan. In conclusion, losartan reduces urine excretion of proteins associated with tubular damage and graft fibrosis."
6543956	"The effect of 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1 alpha,25-(OH)2-D3] on the proliferation and morphologic and biochemical differentiation of cultured human epidermal keratinocytes grown under defined, serum-free conditions was studied. 1 alpha,25-(OH)2-D3 caused a dose-dependent decrease in proliferation and an increase in the morphologic differentiation of human cultured keratinocytes. The number of attached basal cells decreased when exposed to 1 alpha,25-(OH)2-D3, whereas the number of attached squamous cells, terminally differentiated desquamated cells, and cornified cells increased concurrently. In addition, after incubation with 1 alpha,25-(OH)2-D3, there was a shift to cells of lighter density. In conjunction with its effect on the basal cells, 1 alpha,25-(OH)2-D3 resulted in an inhibition of DNA synthesis. The activity of transglutaminase, the enzyme responsible for cross-linking the proteins of the cornified envelope, was stimulated by 156% with 1 alpha,25-(OH)2-D3, but not with 1 beta,25-(OH)2-D3, a biologically inert isomer. Therefore it appears that 1 alpha,25-(OH)2-D3 is a potent inhibitor of keratinocyte proliferation as well as a stimulator of epidermal terminal differentiation."
2148709	"Bilateral acromial dimples are uncommon in pediatric dermatology. They are usually found as a sporadic finding with limited clinical symptoms but may cause concern for parents. They can occur spontaneously or be inherited. Bilateral acromial dimples may occasionally be present as part of more complex syndromes. This article reports an 18-month-old girl with congenital bilateral acromial dimples and presents a classification of this unusual entity. A literature review of English and non-English publications was performed. We report the second case of bilateral acromial dimples seen in the context of maternal cocaine use during pregnancy. Our case is probably sporadic and nonsyndromal. We suggest that bilateral acromial dimples be classified as syndromal or nonsyndromal and that nonsyndromal cases be subdivided into inherited and sporadic. Although bilateral acromial dimples can be seen in 18q deletion syndrome, Apert syndrome, Say syndrome, and a recently described syndrome in Brazil, our review of the literature does not support the association with trisomy 9 syndrome. Dermatologists need to be aware of this unusual cutaneous finding and potential syndromal associations. The significance of the association with fetal exposure to cocaine during pregnancy has yet to be determined. The biological mother was not available for assessment for bilateral acromial dimples."
7723897	"Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are highly conserved signal transduction modules in animals, plants and yeast. MAPK cascades are complicated networks and play vital roles in signal transduction pathways involved in biotic and abiotic stresses. In this study, a maize MAPKK gene, ZmMKK1, was characterized. Quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis demonstrated that ZmMKK1 transcripts were induced by diverse stresses and ABA signal molecule in maize root. Further study showed that the ZmMKK1-overexpressing Arabidopsis enhanced the tolerance to salt and drought stresses. However, seed germination, post-germination growth and stomatal aperture analysis demonstrated that ZmMKK1 overexpression was sensitive to ABA in transgenic Arabidopsis. Molecular genetic analysis revealed that the overexpression of ZmMKK1 in Arabidopsis enhanced the expression of ROS scavenging enzyme- and ABA-related genes, such as POD, CAT, RAB18 and RD29A under salt and drought conditions. In addition, heterologous overexpression of ZmMKK1 in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) improved the tolerance to salt and drought stresses. These results suggested that ZmMKK1 might act as an ABA- and ROS-dependent protein kinase in positive modulation of salt and drought tolerance. Most importantly, ZmMKK1 interacted with ZmMEKK1 as evidenced by yeast two-hybrid assay, redeeming a deficiency of MAPK interaction partners in maize."
9118733	Hereditary hypotrichosis simplex of the scalp is a genotrichosis characterized by a hair defect limited to the scalp in the absence of other ectodermal or systemic abnormalities. Only large pedigrees consistent with autosomal dominant transmission have been described to date. In this article the clinical and scanning electron microscopy findings of a nonfamilial case of congenital scalp hypotrichosis simplex are reported. In some patients the diagnosis of sporadic hypotrichosis simplex of the scalp should be considered after ruling out all other possible causes of congenital and hereditary hypotrichosis.
1966781	"Maltose is the major form of carbon exported from the chloroplast at night as a result of transitory starch breakdown. Maltose exists as an alpha- or beta-anomer. We developed an enzymatic technique for distinguishing between the two anomers of maltose and tested the accuracy and specificity of this technique using beta-maltose liberated from maltoheptose by beta-amylase. This technique was used to investigate which form of maltose is present during transitory starch degradation in bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), wild-type Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), two starch deficient Arabidopsis lines, and one starch-excess mutant of Arabidopsis. In Phaseolus and wild-type Arabidopsis, beta-maltose levels were low during the day but were much higher at night. In Arabidopsis plants unable to metabolize maltose due to a T-DNA insertion in the gene for the cytosolic amylomaltase, (Y. Lu, T.D. Sharkey [2004] Planta 218: 466-473) levels of alpha- and beta-maltose were high during both the day and night. In starchless mutants of Arabidopsis, total maltose levels were low and almost completely in the alpha-form. We also found that the subcellular concentration of beta-maltose at night was greater in the chloroplast than in the cytosol by 278 microm. We conclude that beta-maltose is the metabolically active anomer of maltose and that a sufficient gradient of beta-maltose exists between the chloroplast and cytosol to allow for passive transport of maltose out of chloroplasts at night."
5946208	"Due to a reduction in estrogen levels peri- and post-menopausal skin exhibit a specific phenotype characterized by reduced thickness, reduced elasticity and increased dryness. Loss of these elements results in increased skin wrinkling and skin sagging. In addition, it is well documented that reduced estrogen levels also negatively impacts dermal wound healing. As a result we tested the hypothesis that molecules capable of stimulating and accelerating wound healing can supplement the skin's diminished activities produced by reduced estrogen. Heptapeptide-7, a fragment of a well-characterized wound healing peptide (HB-107), was found to stimulate keratinocyte proliferation and migration and induce collagen synthesis. Microarray analysis of Heptapeptide-7-treated dermal keratinocytes revealed an up-regulation of cell division, growth factor and extracellular matrix genes. Validation of this approach was seen in a clinical study of 32 women (mean age 54) in which forehead wrinkles and skin texture were improved with the application of this peptide fragment."
7623872	"Although there are no known gender-related differences in permeability barrier function in adults, estrogens accelerate whereas testosterone retards barrier development in fetal skin, and male fetuses demonstrate slower barrier development than female littermates. Moreover, prenatal administration of the androgen receptor antagonist, flutamide, equalizes developmental rates in male and female fetuses. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of changes in testosterone on barrier homeostasis in adult murine and human skin. Hypogonadal mice (whether by castration or by treatment with systemic flutamide) displayed significantly faster barrier recovery at 3, 6, and 12 h than did controls, and testosterone replacement slowed barrier recovery in castrated mice. Moreover, testosterone directly effects the skin, as topical flutamide also accelerated barrier recovery in normal male mice. These findings appear to be of physiologic significance, since prepubertal male mice (age 5 wk) displayed accelerated barrier recovery in comparison with adult postpubertal (11 wk) males. These studies also appear to be relevant for humans, as a hypopituitary human subject demonstrated repeated changes in barrier recovery in parallel with peaks and nadirs in serum testosterone levels during intermittent testosterone replacement. Mechanistic studies showed that differences in epidermal lipid synthesis do not account for the testosterone-induced functional alterations. Instead, epidermal lamellar body (LB) formation and secretion both decrease, resulting in decreased extracellular lamellar bilayers in testosterone-replete animals. These studies demonstrate that fluctuations in testosterone modulate barrier function, and that testosterone repletion can have negative consequences for permeability barrier homeostasis."
7644445	"High Cl(-) concentrations in tissues can be toxic to crop plants and may lead to reduced growth rates and yields. 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED) is thought to be involved in the biosynthesis of abscisic acid (ABA), which is an important regulator of plant adaptive responses to stress. Here, the expression of MhNCED3 in Malus hupehensis Rehd. and the effects of MhNCED3 on plant tolerance to Cl(-) stress were explored. The results showed that MhNCED3 expression and ABA biosynthesis in M. hupehensis Rehd. were induced by Cl(-) stress. Ectopic expression of MhNCED3 in Arabidopsis complemented the phenotypic defects of the 129B08/nced3 mutant and enhanced WT tolerance to Cl(-) stress. The transgenic Arabidopsis showed improved growth and developmental status, increased ABA contents, and reduced transpiration rates and relative water content. Furthermore, ectopic expression of MhNCED3 decreased Cl(-) accumulation and oxidative damage, and up-regulated the expression levels of AtCLCc (chloride channel protein) and AtSLAH3 (slow anion channel 1 homolog 3) genes in Arabidopsis. These observations suggest that MhNCED3 has critical role in enhancing plant tolerance to Cl(-) stress by reducing Cl(-) accumulation."

On physical examination a slightly infiltrated, smooth red to brown nodule was seen at the left malar region. A biopsy established the diagnosis of granuloma faciale. After two-months therapy with topical tacrolimus 0,1%, nodule was resolved."
3382082	"The western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis) is a polyphagous herbivore that causes serious damage to many agricultural plants. In addition to causing feeding damage, it is also a vector insect that transmits tospoviruses such as Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV). We previously reported that thrips feeding on plants induces a jasmonate (JA)-regulated plant defense, which negatively affects both the performance and preference (i.e. host plant attractiveness) of the thrips. The antagonistic interaction between a JA-regulated plant defense and a salicylic acid (SA)-regulated plant defense is well known. Here we report that TSWV infection allows thrips to feed heavily and multiply on Arabidopsis plants. TSWV infection elevated SA contents and induced SA-regulated gene expression in the plants. On the other hand, TSWV infection decreased the level of JA-regulated gene expression induced by thrips feeding. Importantly, we also demonstrated that thrips significantly preferred TSWV-infected plants to uninfected plants. In JA-insensitive coi1-1 mutants, however, thrips did not show a preference for TSWV-infected plants. In addition, SA application to wild-type plants increased their attractiveness to thrips. Our results suggest the following mechanism: TSWV infection suppresses the anti-herbivore response in plants and attracts its vector, thrips, to virus-infected plants by exploiting the antagonistic SA-JA plant defense systems."
8504964	"Limited data are available on the incidence and characteristics of culture-negative fever following pancreas transplantation (PTx) with anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) induction. Our study aims to better define the features of culture-negative fever, so it can be delineated from infectious fever, hopefully helping clinicians to guide antibiotic therapy in this high-risk patient population.                                                                              We performed a retrospective cohort study of postoperative fever among 198 consecutive patients undergoing PTx at our center between August 1, 2004 and December 31, 2014. Fever was classified as culture-negative if there was neither a positive culture nor a documented clinical diagnosis of infection.                                                                              Fever was identified in 113 patients; 66 were deemed to be infectious, 39 were culture-negative, and 8 were indeterminate. High body mass index of recipient (odds ratio 1.87, 95% confidence interval: 1.15-3.03, P = 0.011) was a significant factor associated with culture-negative fever in multivariate analysis. No patients with culture-negative fever were diagnosed with infiltrates or effusion on chest radiography. In addition, an increase in white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and serum amylase was less prominent in culture-negative fever. Culture-negative fever developed most frequently at postoperative 7 or 14 days, showing a biphasic curve.                                                                                     Culture-negative fever develops in a substantial proportion of patients early after PTx. The awareness of the possibility and clinical features of post-transplant culture-negative fever might help clinicians to guide antibiotic therapy in this high-risk patient population, especially following ATG induction and early steroid withdrawal."
3183114	"The phenomenon of codon usage bias has been observed in a wide range of organisms. As organisms evolve, how their codon usage pattern change is still an intriguing question. In this article, we focused on the green plant mitochondrial genomes to analyze the codon usage patterns in different lineages, and more importantly, to investigate the possible change of determining forces during the plant evolution. Two patterns were observed between the separate lineages of green plants: Chlorophyta and Streptophyta. In Chlorophyta lineages, their codon usages showed substantial variation (from strongly A, T-biased to strongly G, C-biased); while in Streptophyta lineages, especially in the land plants, the overall codon usages are interestingly stable. Further, based on the Nc-GC3s plots and Akashi's scaled χ(2) -tests, we found that lineages within Chlorophyta exhibit much stronger evidence of deviating from neutrality; while lineages within Streptophyta rarely do so. Such differences, together with previous reports based on the chloroplast data, suggests that after plants colonized the land, their codon usages in organellar genomes are more reluctant to be shaped by selection force."
3244180	"A quality-of-life study was carried out to test the hypothesis that melanoma patients treated with a 3-cm margin of excision suffer greater impairment of their quality of life than those treated with a 1-cm margin. The secondary aim was to determine the predictors of a poor patient perception of their excision scar. A postal questionnaire study was carried out using Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD), Psychosocial Adjustment of Illness Scale-Self-Report (PAIS-SR), Medical Outcomes Survey-Short Form 36 (MOS-SF36), and the Cassileth Scar questionnaires. Data were collected from 426 of the 537 patients who were mailed the questionnaires (response rate 79%). Fourteen percent had clinically significant anxiety and 5% had significant depression. A poor attitude toward quality of health care was associated with youth. Patients treated with a 3-cm margin excision had significantly poorer mental and physical function 1 mo after surgery, which disappeared within 6 mo. The greater difficulties experienced by the 3-cm margin group were particularly in their domestic, sexual, and social roles. Women, younger patients, those with poor physical and mental function after surgery, and those treated by a 3-cm margin were more likely to report a poorer perception of their scar. The poorer scar perception of patients in the 3-cm group persisted throughout the study period. Use of a 3-cm margin of excision for melanoma is associated with significantly more morbidity than use of a 1-cm margin, but this effect disappears in 6 mo. Patients treated by 3-cm excision were more likely, however, to have a persistent poor view of their scar. Youth and being female were also predictors of poor perception of the scar."
2867069	"In healthy skin, tape stripping induces a transient wave of histological changes resembling immune-mediated skin diseases, such as psoriasis. The response to surface trauma may harbor mechanisms which are also relevant to the development of Koebner-positive skin disorders. However, studies on newly discovered drivers of inflammation in regenerative skin are lacking.                                                                              The course of epidermal proliferation and keratinization as well as key representatives of innate and acquired immunity were studied during the first 72 h after tape stripping.                                                                              Epidermal rupture rapidly activates various epidermal processes, which remain upregulated for 72 h. Elastase+ and IL-17+ cells dominate the acute phase and their numbers decrease rapidly thereafter. The number of T-Bet+ cells increases more gradually, reaching maximum levels several hours later when the other cell types decrease.                                                                                      This model permits investigations on the sequence of crucial inflammatory processes set off by cutaneous injury, which are presumed to play a role within the pathogenesis of immune-mediated skin diseases exhibiting the Koebner phenomenon."
6644389	"Statins improve cardiovascular outcome, but less is known on the renal outcome. We, therefore, studied the relationship between the use of statins and urinary albumin excretion (UAE) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in two settings: a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and an observational cohort study, in which patients were included to study the impact of an elevated UAE on renal and cardiovascular prognosis.                                                                              We used data from the Prevention of REnal and Vascular ENd-stage Disease Intervention trial (PREVEND-IT) and the PREVEND cohort study. The PREVEND-IT subjects (788 with a UAE 15-300 mg/day) received pravastatin 40 mg/day vs placebo and/or fosinopril 20 mg/day vs placebo in a 2x2 factorial-RCT design. Of the 3440 cohort subjects, 469 used statins during the 4-year follow-up period. Multivariate-regression adjusted for confounding factors and the propensity score was used to estimate the relation between statin use and UAE and GFR.                                                                              In the RCT, pravastatin did not change UAE or GFR, neither in fosinopril yes/no subgroups. In the observational cohort, statin use was associated with a rise in UAE (+12.1%), compared with statin non-use (+3.6%, P<   0.001). This rise was most pronounced in those on statins prior to the first screening [+24.8% (95% CI: 11.9-39.2)], those using statins>   3 years [+18.5% (7.3-30.8)] and those with >   1 or >   2 defined daily doses (+15.7 and +17.3%, respectively). These differences remained significant after adjustment for relevant variables and propensity score. The rise in UAE could not be attributed to a higher dose or a specific statin. GFR fell in 4 years in both statin users and non-users (4.6+/-13.5 and 2.4+/-11.2, respectively). The fall in GFR between groups was not different after adjustment (P=0.11).                                                                                      We conclude from the RCT data that statins do not lower UAE in subjects selected because of an elevated UAE instead of hyperlipidaemia. In the observational cohort study, the use of statins similarly was not associated with a fall in UAE; UAE instead increased. Statin treatment was not associated with a significant change in GFR in these subjects with only modestly impaired GFR."
5184343	"The effect of photoperiodism on steviol glycoside (SVgly) accumulation was investigated in Stevia rebaudiana. Topped plants were cultivated to develop new branches under a 16h or 8h photoperiod. During different ontogenetic phases, leaves, stems, lateral shoots, roots and reproductive organs were collected and analysed for nine SVglys. Long-day (LD) conditions prolonged vegetative growth, significantly increasing leaf biomass and total SVgly content. In both photoperiods, declines in SVglys were observed during reproductive development, occurring mainly in mature leaves under LDs or young leaves under SDs. When lateral shoots were included in plants under LDs, total leaf and SVgly yield per branch significantly increased, indicating a harvest during flowering is possible. The ratio of rebaudioside A (Reb A) to stevioside (ST) amounts was influenced by ontogeny and daylength, with larger ratios during vegetative growth under SDs. Linear correlations were observed between dry matter and total SVglys and between the major SVglys individually. Minor SVglys showed larger fluctuations, especially under SDs. Under LDs, the Reb A to ST ratio was inversely correlated with both leaf dry matter and total SVglys. The highly dynamic nature of the observed patterns suggests a complex regulation of SVgly metabolism on molecular and biochemical level."
9062560	"Non-host resistance (NHR) is the resistance of plants to a plethora of non-adapted pathogens and is considered as one of the most robust resistance mechanisms of plants. Studies have shown that the efficiency of resistance in general and NHR in particular could vary in different plant organs, thus pointing to tissue-specific determinants. This was exemplified by research on host and non-host interactions of the fungal plant pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae with rice and Arabidopsis, respectively. Thus, rice roots were shown to be impaired in resistance to M. oryzae isolates to which leaves of the same rice cultivar are highly resistant. Moreover, roots of Arabidopsis are also accessible to penetration by M. oryzae while leaves of this non-host plant cannot be infected. We addressed the question whether or not other plant tissues such as the reproductive system also differ in NHR compared to leaves. Inoculation experiments on wheat with different Magnaporthe species forming either a host or non-host type of interaction revealed that NHR was as effective on spikes as on leaves. This finding might pave the way for combatting M. oryzae disease on wheat spikes which has become a serious threat especially in South America."
9145256	"Lung transplantation is currently limited by the number of suitable donor organs. Many lung-transplant programs use lungs that do not meet the formal criteria for acceptability; however, the immediate and long-term consequences of this approach remain unclear.                                                                              We performed a retrospective cohort study of all patients who underwent lung transplantation at the Columbia University Medical Center from July 2001 to July 2003. We assessed the outcomes of recipients of extended donor lungs compared with those of recipients of optimal donor lungs after adjusting for confounding variables.                                                                              Fifty-one patients underwent lung transplantation, of which 27 (53%) received extended donor lungs. Recipients of extended donor lungs had fewer intensive care unit-free days at 30 days (P=0.002) and a longer time to hospital discharge (P=0.007) than did recipients of optimal donor lungs. Extended donor recipients also had lower forced expiratory volume in 1 second % predicted at 1 year than did optimal donor recipients (P=0.03). There were no differences in the 30-day or longer-term survival of extended and optimal donor lung recipients.                                                                                      Recipients of extended donor lungs have a longer intensive care unit course, a prolonged hospital stay, and lower pulmonary function at 1 year than recipients of optimal lungs. Despite these differences, survival is similar between the two groups. The criteria for the optimal lung donor should be re-evaluated considering the current shortage of acceptable organs. Although some outcomes may differ with the use of extended donor lungs, the clinical impact of these differences should be assessed in future prospective multicenter studies."
3056157	"Expanding the pool of potentially compatible donors is one approach to improving access to transplantation for the sensitized candidate. The identification of unacceptable antigens and incorporation into UNet(sm) could form the basis for regional or national sharing. A rational approach using currently available assays can increase donor access for highly sensitized recipients. However, the limitations of the results and interpretations of these assays, and limitations in the types of data that can be entered into UNet(sm), affect the accuracy of predicting crossmatch outcome for highly sensitized candidates. It is possible to stratify UA based on the strength of antibodies in the single-antigen assays. Entering all antibody specificities as UA resulted in accurate prediction of compatible crossmatches. Entering only those UA associated with higher-titered antibodies lowered the accuracy of predicting a compatible crossmatch. However, the combination of assigning fewer UA and performing more crossmatches per candidate provided transplants for sensitized individuals at a higher proportion, compared to assigning more UA that ruled out a larger number of donors."
7828100	"We have studied the effects of interferon (IFN)-alpha, beta, and gamma in vitro on the growth and invasive potential of human melanoma SK-MEL-118 cells. The antiproliferative effects of IFNs were assessed by a quantitative regrowth assay in which cells were treated with IFNs at concentrations of 10(2), 10(3) or 10(4) IU/ml for 3 days (until day 4) and then further incubated without IFNs for 7 days (until day 11). The growth inhibitory effect of each IFN on melanoma cells was dose- and time-dependent. Among these three types of IFNs, however, IFN-beta exerted the strongest inhibitory effect on cell growth. To assess the anti-invasive effect of each IFN on melanoma cells, we employed an in vitro assay system using matrigel-coated Transwell chambers. When cells were treated with 10(2), 10(3), or 10(4) IU/ml of the three types of IFNs for 24 hours, the amount of tritiated thymidine incorporated into melanoma cells were treated for 24 hours with 10(4) IU/ml of IFN-beta or gamma prior to the assay, the number of cells that invaded the filter decreased by 40%; this decrease was only 10% with the same amount of IFN-alpha. Simultaneous addition of IFNs during the invasion assay was not effective in any combination. Only when the cells were pretreated with IFNs, antiinvasive effects against melanoma cells were exerted. IFN-alpha was less inhibitory than IFN-beta or gamma on proliferation and not at all inhibitory on invasion. Considering both the antiproliferative and antiinvasive effects of IFNs, our results suggest that IFN-beta has the strongest antitumoral effect on human melanoma cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
3661965	"Cutaneous side effects of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors (EGFRIs) are very frequent and well known. The aim of our study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of pimecrolimus 1% cream in the treatment of papulopustular eruption caused by EGFRIs and to review the relevant literature on therapeutic approaches.                                                                              Twenty cancer patients being treated with EGFRIs were included in the study. Nine of the patients showed grade 1 and 11 showed grade 2 papulopustular eruption. All patients were treated with pimecrolimus 1% cream, which was applied twice daily. Patients with grade 2 eruption also received systemic minocycline 100 mg/day.                                                                              All patients with grade 1 eruption responded to treatment, with 4/9 experiencing complete resolution of the lesions 2 weeks after the initiation of treatment. Five out of 11 patients with grade 2 eruption had more than 50% improvement in erythema and pustules, and 1 had complete resolution of the skin lesions. Two patients did not respond to treatment but were significantly improved after substitution of pimecrolimus 1% cream with metronidazole 1% cream. No side effects were recorded.                                                                                      Our case series shows that pimecrolimus cream may be an effective and safe approach in the management of papulopustular eruption related to EGFRIs."
7670577	"Phosphoglucan phosphatases are novel enzymes that remove phosphates from complex carbohydrates. In plants, these proteins are vital components in the remobilization of leaf starch at night. Breakdown of starch is initiated through reversible glucan phosphorylation to disrupt the semi-crystalline starch structure at the granule surface. The phosphoglucan phosphatases starch excess 4 (SEX4) and like-SEX4 2 (LSF2) dephosphorylate glucans to provide access for amylases that release maltose and glucose from starch. Another phosphatase, LSF1, is a putative inactive scaffold protein that may act as regulator of starch degradative enzymes at the granule surface. Absence of these phosphatases disrupts starch breakdown, resulting in plants accumulating excess starch. Here, we describe recent advances in understanding the biochemical and structural properties of each of these starch phosphatases."
1489361	"Five genes (Gy1, through Gy5) encode most of the subunits that are assembled into glycinin, a predominant seed storage protein found in soybeans. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms are described that identify four of these five genes (Gy1/Gy2, Gy3, and Gy5). The fifth gene (Gy4) is characterized by two alleles, one of which (gy4) causes absence of the subunit. Genetic segregation studies indicate that the five genes are located at four genetic loci within the genome. Gy1 and Gy2 are in a direct tandem repeat at one locus, whereas there is a single glycinin gene at each of the other three loci. All four loci segregate independently from one another, and they also segregate independently from the genetic markers for tawny/grey pubescence (T/t), purple/white flower color (W1/w1), light/dark hilum pigmentation (l/ll), black/brown seed coat (R/r), and brown/tan pod color (I1I1L2L2/I1I1I2I2). The latter genetic markers are located on linkage groups 1 (t), 8 (w1), 7 (i), and 2 (r) in the soybean genome, respectively."
9372270	"Transmembrane receptor-like kinases characterized by the presence of one or more lysin motif (LysM) domains in the extracytoplasmic portion (LysM-containing receptor-like kinases [LYKs]) mediate recognition of symbiotic and pathogenic microorganisms in plants. The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genome encodes five putative LYKs; among them, AtLYK1/CHITIN ELICITOR RECEPTOR KINASE1 is required for response to chitin and peptidoglycan, and AtLYK4 contributes to chitin perception. More recently, AtLYK3 has been shown to be required for full repression, mediated by Nod factors, of Arabidopsis innate immune responses. In this work, we show that AtLYK3 also negatively regulates basal expression of defense genes and resistance to Botrytis cinerea and Pectobacterium carotovorum infection. Enhanced resistance of atlyk3 mutants requires PHYTOALEXIN-DEFICIENT3, which is crucial for camalexin biosynthesis. The expression of AtLYK3 is strongly repressed by elicitors and fungal infection and is induced by the hormone abscisic acid (ABA), which has a negative impact on resistance against B. cinerea and P. carotovorum. Plants lacking a functional AtLYK3 also show reduced physiological responses to ABA and are partially resistant to ABA-induced inhibition of PHYTOALEXIN-DEFICIENT3 expression. These results indicate that AtLYK3 is important for the cross talk between signaling pathways activated by ABA and pathogens."
3358111	"Relatively little is known about the mechanisms that govern the expression of plant mitochondrial genomes. We have addressed this problem by analyzing the transcriptional activity of different regions of the maize mitochondrial genome using both in vivo and isolated mitochondrial pulse-labeling systems. The regions examined included the protein genes atpA, atp6, and coxII, the 26S, 18S, and 5S rRNA genes, and sequences surrounding the rRNA genes. The rRNAs were found to be transcribed at rates fivefold to 10-fold higher than the protein genes. These rate differences are comparable with the differences in abundance of these species in the total or steady-state RNA population. Pulse-labeled RNA unexpectedly detected transcription of all regions examined, including approximately 21 kilobases of presumed noncoding sequences flanking the rRNA genes for which stable transcripts were not detected. The results obtained with RNA labeled for short pulses in vivo and in isolated mitochondria were similar, suggesting that isolated mitochondria provide a faithful run-on transcription assay. Our results indicate that the absence in total RNA of transcripts homologous to a given region of maize mitochondrial DNA does not necessarily exclude transcriptional activity of that region and that both transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes play important roles in maize mitochondrial genome expression."
4920061	"The skin of the rhino mouse, an allelic variant of the hariless mouse, contains deep dermal cysts and huge numbers of hornfilled utriculi which resemble comedones. Chemicals which influence either differentiation or desquamation of horny cells were applied topically twice daily for up to 6 weeks. Except for the dermal cysts, the gross epithelial abnormalities were almost completely corrected by retinoic acid in a dose-dependent fashion. Salicylic acid caused partial emptying of the horny masses, but the utriculi did not regress. Lactic acid, propylene glycol and benzoyl peroxide had minor effects on keratinization and exfoliation. The rhino mouse is a suitable model for assessing chemicals which affect epithelial differentiation (retinoids)or which promote loss of cohesion between horny cells (descaling agents)."
4557876	"Edema commonly accompanies surgical procedures and when excessive, can adversely affect surgical outcomes. The skin extracellular matrix, including one of its primary components, hyaluronan (HA), is a significant barrier to effective drainage of accumulated edematous fluid. Recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) is a human hyaluronidase that acts transiently and locally to depolymerize HA. A non-liposomal gel formulation that provides a sustained release of rHuPH20 was tested in vivo in a preclinical murine model of acquired lymphedema.                                                                              Lymphedemic mice were injected 24 hours before surgery, and at 2 and 12 days following surgery with rHuPH20 sustained release gel (PH20 SR gel). Quantitative assessment of treatment response indicated that a single dose of PH20 SR gel resulted in accelerated resolution and reduced severity of post-surgical edema as compared to the gel vehicle (control).                                                                              Statistically significant enzymatic degradation of HA was demonstrated up to 5 mm from the injection site, and histological analysis confirmed removal of HA up to 72 hours following PH20 SR gel administration.                                                                                      These results demonstrate sustained hyaluronidase enzymatic activity that promotes diffusion of accumulated post-surgical edematous fluid, suggesting that PH20 SR gel may be a useful adjuvant in promoting postoperative edema resolution."

The mycelial phase of the organism predominates in lesions of pityriasis versicolor.                                                                                   To evaluate the cell-mediated immune (CMI) response to the mycelial phase of Malassezia in patients with this disease, which has not previously been studied.                                                                              The CMI status of 12 patients with pityriasis versicolor and 12 age- and sex-matched controls to mycelial antigen(s) of the organism was examined. The responses to the mycelial form of three strains of the organism were assessed using lymphocyte transformation and leucocyte migration inhibition assays.                                                                              The transformation responses of the lymphocytes from both patients and controls gave transformation indices <    or = 3, although the responses of lymphocytes from patients with pityriasis versicolor to the mycelial form of Malassezia strains were generally higher than those of the controls. In the leucocyte migration inhibition assay, leucocytes from patients with pityriasis versicolor and controls responded to the mycelial antigens of three different Malassezia strains; however, there was no significant difference in leucocyte response between patients with pityriasis versicolor and controls.                                                                                      Patients with pityriasis versicolor do not therefore have a CMI deficiency to Malassezia mycelial antigens but fail to generate a protective CMI response to mycelial antigens over and above that of control individuals during active disease."
1714169	"Non-invasive luminescence imaging is of great interest for studying biological parameters in wound healing, tumors and other biomedical fields. Recently, we developed the first method for 2D luminescence imaging of pH in vivo on humans, and a novel method for one-stop-shop visualization of oxygen and pH using the RGB read-out of digital cameras. Both methods make use of semitransparent sensor foils. Here, we describe a sprayable ratiometric luminescent pH sensor, which combines properties of both these methods. Additionally, a major advantage is that the sensor spray is applicable to very uneven tissue surfaces due to its consistency. A digital RGB image of the spray on tissue is taken. The signal of the pH indicator (fluorescein isothiocyanate) is stored in the green channel (G), while that of the reference dye [ruthenium(II)-tris-(4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline)] is stored in the red channel (R). Images are processed by rationing luminescence intensities (G/R) to result in pseudocolor pH maps of tissues, e.g. wounds."
1835928	"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a skin manifestation of atopy caused by hyperreactivity to various antigens. Studies have shown that 60-100% of patients with this condition present with colonization by Staphylococcus aureus. Given increasing rates of antimicrobial resistance, the sensitivity to antimicrobials of S. aureus colonizing atopic patients has been investigated. Cross-sectional studies worldwide suggest that the prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection (MRSA) in the AD population varies from 0% to 30.8%.                                                                                   The objectives of this study were to determinate the prevalence of S. aureus and MRSA in patients with AD in two dermatologic centers in Porto Alegre, Brazil.                                                                              A total of 91 patients with AD attending two dermatologic centers in Porto Alegre were enrolled in this study from December 2009 to July 2011. Two skin swabs were taken from each patient, one from the nares and the other from a non-infected eczematous skin lesion. The swabs were sent to the laboratory, where standard procedures to isolate bacteria and identify S. aureus, antimicrobial resistance, and sensitivity patterns were carried out. The severity of AD was defined using the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI).                                                                              Of the 91 patients sampled, 67 (73.6%) patients were found to be positive for S. aureus colonization. Nasal swabs were positive in 55 (60.4%) patients, lesional swabs in 44 (48.4%) patients, and both lesional and nasal swabs were positive in 32 (35.2%) patients. Patients with positive swabs had a higher mean ± standard deviation EASI score [mean (9.1 ± 8.8)] compared with patients with negative swabs (3.9 ± 3.6) (P = 0.002). None of the 91 patients showed any evidence of MRSA infection. Overall, nearly 32% of the S. aureus isolated from nasal swabs and 36.40% of the S. aureus isolated from lesional swabs was resistant to erythromycin.                                                                                      The results of this study confirm a high rate of S. aureus colonization in pediatric patients with AD and indicate a relevant association between colonization and high EASI score. No MRSA was found in cultures from this sample of patients in southern Brazil. Nearly one-third of isolates were identified as resistant to erythromycin, an antibiotic that is commonly used in pediatric patients."
2232874	"The proportion of T lymphocytes bearing the gamma/delta and alpha/beta T cell antigen receptors was determined in histological sections of skin from normal subjects and patients suffering from acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) using antibodies to the delta and beta chains. The proportion of gamma/delta cells in GVHD was very low (4.3% of CD3+ cells) but significantly higher than in skin from normal donors (0.8%) and marrow recipients without GVHD (0%). The significance of this is not clear and we were unable to determine whether it represented selective localization of these cells to the skin or simply reflected peripheral blood values in the early post-transplant period in some patients with GVHD. Localization of gamma/delta cells to the epidermis was not seen; all were identified in the dermis particularly in the perivascular zone. Although it is not possible to exclude a role for gamma/delta cells in initiating GVHD, the present study suggests that they do not play an important role in producing the epidermal damage that characterizes this condition."

1663682	"Thymoglobulin (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA) is an antithymocyte globulin preparation used for induction immunosuppression therapy in solid organ transplantation. It is being utilized with increasing frequency in orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) in an effort to minimize or delay the use of calcineurin inhibitors due to their inherent nephrotoxicity. Experience with thymoglobulin in OLT remains limited. We report a case of serum sickness in a patient who received thymoglobulin following OLT. The patient experienced intermittent fevers, polyarthralgia, and acute renal failure 9 days after completion of thymoglobulin administration. The patient's symptoms resolved rapidly and completely with a course of intravenous steroids. We review a set of diagnostic criteria for serum sickness and emphasize the importance of early recognition of the process. Early treatment of serum sickness with steroids or plasmapheresis is highly effective and can reduce unnecessary morbidity from this unusual sequela of induction immunosuppression with antithymocyte globulin."
2254573	"Homeodomain-leucine zipper (HDZip) proteins constitute a large family of transcription factors apparently unique to plants. In this report we characterize the DNA-binding and dimerization preferences in vitro of class I HDZip proteins. Using gel-exclusion chromatography and in vitro protein binding assays we demonstrate that the HDZip class I protein ATHB5 forms a homodimeric complex in solution. Consistent with this finding we have demonstrated the sequence-specific interaction of ATHB5 with a 9 bp pseudopalindromic DNA sequence, CAATNATTG, composed of two half-sites overlapping at a central position, by use of a PCR-assisted binding-site selection assay and competitive EMSA experiments. A majority of other known members of HDZip class I interacted with similar DNA sequences, but differed in their preference for A/T versus G/C in the central position of the binding site. Selective heterodimerization in vitro was demonstrated between ATHB5 and different class I HDZip proteins. Heterodimer formation between class I HDZip proteins is of potential functional significance for the integration of information from different signalling pathways in the control of plant development."

Our aim has been evaluating the influence of an acute dose of cinacalcet on the gastrointestinal hormonal responses to a test meal in uraemic patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD) or haemodialysis (HD).                                                                              Twenty patients (11 PD, 9 HD) on cinacalcet treatment (30-120 mg/day) were studied. Twelve patients (1 PD, 11 HD) who never received cinacalcet were studied as control group. Each patient received a test meal with blood samples at 0, 2 and 4 h. At 0 time, patients in the cinacalcet group received their usual oral dose of this calcimimetic. Plasma concentrations of intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), ghrelin, substance P, serotonin, cholecystokinin (CCK) and gastrin were quantified at 0, 2 and 4 h.                                                                              No significant differences in baseline concentrations of serum VIP, ghrelin, substance P, serotonine, CCK and gastrin were found between controls and cinacalcet-treated patients. In comparison with the control group, cinacalcet administration was followed by a significant decrease in VIP concentration at 4 h and a significant increase in substance P at 4 h. However, the areas under the curves of all studied gut hormones were similar in both groups.                                                                                     An acute dose of cinacalcet exerts minimal influence on gut hormone responses to a mixed meal in dialysis patients on chronic therapy with this drug. The small but significant differences between control subjects and patients on cinacalcet in VIP and substance P levels at 4 h should be investigated in symptomatic patients."
9557542	"Alopecia in women is a common problem, and conflicting observational data have failed to determine whether an association exists between alopecia and iron deficiency in women. We therefore utilized an analytical cross-sectional methodology to evaluate whether common types of alopecia in women are associated with decreased tissue iron stores, as measured by serum ferritin. We studied patients with telogen effluvium (n = 30), androgenetic alopecia (n = 52), alopecia areata (n = 17), and alopecia areata totalis/universalis (n = 7). The normal group consisted of 11 subjects without hair loss from the same referral base and source population as those patients with alopecia. We analyzed the data utilizing the unpaired Student's t test assuming unequal variances with an alpha adjustment for multiple comparisons to assess whether the mean ages, ferritin levels, and hemoglobin levels of women without hair loss differed from the means in each alopecia group. The mean age of patients and normals did not differ significantly. We found that the mean ferritin level (ng per ml [95% confidence intervals]) in patients with androgenetic alopecia (37.3 128.4, 46.1]) and alopecia areata (24.9 [17.2, 32.6]) were statistically significantly lower than in normals without hair loss (59.5 [40.8, 78.1]). The mean ferritin levels in patients with telogen effluvium (50.1 [33.9, 66.33]) and alopecia areata totalis/universalis (52.3 [23.1, 81.5]) were not significantly lower than in normals. Our findings have implications regarding therapeutics, clinical trial design, and understanding the triggers for alopecia."
9750588	"A safe, easy, and effective outpatient modality for the treatment of various cutaneous lesions such as hemangiomas and decorative tattoos has long been sought. The argon laser has proved satisfactory for such treatment of port-wine hemangiomas, capillary/cavernous hemangiomas, telangiectasia, and decorative tattoos as well as a variety of cutaneous pigmented lesions. The intense laser light is attracted and absorbed by pigmented skin lesions producing heat that selectively destroys the intradermal pathologic condition and spares overlying skin. Hemangiomas and tattoos have undergone satisfactory subtotal blanching in the majority of cases with a low incidence of hypertrophic scarring. Thus, the argon laser has proved useful in the outpatient treatment of a variety of pigmented cutaneous lesions."

3510380	"Junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous recessively inherited blistering disease of the skin and mucous membranes due to impaired epithelial adhesion. In particular, defective expression of the 180-kD bullous pemphigoid antigen (BP180) has been correlated to a non-lethal (non-Herlitz) form of JEB, generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa (GABEB), characterized by widespread skin blistering healing with atrophy and by atrophic alopecia with onset in childhood. We report the case of a 33-year-old man suffering from a generalized blistering skin disorder since birth. He also presented nail dystrophy and tooth abnormalities. Mucosal involvement was limited to gingival erosion. Alopecia was absent and body, axillary and pubic hair were normal. Immunofluorescence analysis showed a markedly reduced expression of BP180, electron microscopy studies evidenced hypoplastic hemidesmosomes and Northern blot analysis confirmed a striking decrease in the amount of BP180 mRNA. The clinical features of our patient confirm that BP180 deficiency usually results in a non-Herlitz JEB form. However, the degree of skin, mucous membranes and hair involvement appears more variable and less typical than originally described for GABEB."
5305780	"Data from 170 consecutive patients aged 19-66 years (median age 46 years) who underwent unmanipulated autologous blood stem cell transplant (ASCT) were analyzed to determine if total CD34+ cells/kg infused, CD34+ subsets (CD34+41+, CD34+90+, CD34+33-, CD34+38-, CD34+38-DR-), peripheral blood CD34+ cell (PBCD34+) count on first apheresis day, or various clinical factors were associated with low blood counts 6 months post ASCT. Thirty-four patients were excluded from analysis either because of death (n = 17) or re-induction chemotherapy prior to 6 months post ASCT (n = 13), or because of lack of follow-up data (n = 4). Of the remaining 136 patients, 46% had low WBC ( <    4 x 10(9)/l), 41% low platelets (<   150 x 10(9)/l), and 34% low hemoglobin ( <    120 g/l) at a median of 6 months following ASCT. By Spearman's rank correlation, both the total CD34+ cell dose/kg and the PBCD34+ count correlated with 6 month blood counts better than any subset of CD34+ cells or any clinical factor. The PBCD34+ count was overall a stronger predictor of 6 month blood counts than was the total CD34+ cells/kg infused. Both factors retained their significance in multivariate analysis, controlling for clinical factors. In conclusion, subsets of CD34+ cells and clinical factors are inferior to the total CD34+ cell dose/kg and PBCD34+ count in predicting 6 month blood counts following ASCT."

Although treatment to reduce anti-human leukocyte antigen antibodies using plasmapheresis, intravenous immunoglobulin, and rituximab has been reported to be beneficial, in practice these are often ineffective. Moreover, these interventions do not affect the mature antibody producing plasma cell. Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor active against plasma cells, has been shown to reduce DSA in renal transplant patients with AMR. We report here the first use of bortezomib for cardiac transplant recipients in four pediatric heart recipients with biopsy-proven AMR, hemodynamic compromise, positive crossmatch, and high titer class I DSA.                                                                              Patients received four intravenous dose of bortezomib (1.3 mg/m(2)) over 2 weeks with plasmapheresis and rituximab. DSA specificity and strength (mean fluorescence intensity) was determined with Luminex. All had received previous treatment with plasmapheresis, intravenous immunoglobulin, and rituximab that was ineffective.                                                                              AMR resolved in all patients treated with bortezomib with improvement in systolic function, conversion of biopsy to C4d negative in three patients and IgG negative in one patient, and a prompt, precipitous reduction in DSAs. In three patients who received plasmapheresis before bortezomib, plasmapheresis failed to reduce DSA. In one case, DSA increased after bortezomib but decreased after retreatment.                                                                                      Bortezomib reduces DSA and may be an important adjunct to treatment of AMR in cardiac transplant recipients. Bortezomib may also be useful in desensitization protocols and in prevention of AMR in sensitized patients with positive crossmatch and elevated DSA."
5546343	"Nevus sebaceus of Jadassohn is a complex congenital hamartoma that has a predominant sebaceous component. It presents as waxy, well-circumscribed, yellow plaques localized to the head and neck. Its genetic etiology has more often been described as sporadic, with scattered cases featuring autosomal dominant transmission also reported. The development of benign tumors within the lesions is a well-known phenomenon and requires clinical surveillance for new growths suggesting malignant transformation.                                                                                        We report three cases of nevus sebaceus of Jadassohn localized to the scalp in a mother and her two daughters.                                                                                      This case further supports the underlying genetic association in familial cases of NSJ, specifically autosomal dominant transmission."
4493306	"Trimethylaminuria (fish-odor syndrome) is a rare metabolic disorder characterized by a body malodor similar to that of decaying fish. The condition results from mutations affecting the flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) gene. Affected individuals may exhibit a variety of psychosocial phenomena. A high index of suspicion for this disorder needs to be maintained when treating individuals presenting with a history of real or perceived body odor. Observation We evaluated a 41-year-old man who presented with a long medical history of a fishy body odor. Results from biochemical investigations confirmed a diagnosis of primary trimethylaminuria, and results of molecular genetic studies revealed homozygosity for a mutation on exon 4 of the FMO3 gene, FMO3/P153L (c.458C -->    T). The patient found that information he subsequently obtained about his condition on the Internet and discussion with friends and family members to be the most useful therapeutic approach.                                                                                      Trimethylaminuria is a rare metabolic disorder. Psychological accompaniments are recognized as major sources of distress to affected individuals. We discuss the features of this syndrome and highlight the importance of counseling and support in the treatment of such patients."
3221029	"Demodex mites colonized the hair follicles and sebaceous glands of mammals millions of years ago and have remained relatively unchanged in this protected ecologic niche since then. The host immune system detects and tolerates their presence. Toll-like receptor-2 of keratinocytes has been demonstrated to recognize mite chitin and to elicit an innate immune response. The subsequent acquired immune response is poorly understood at present, but there is experimental and clinical evidence that this is the main mechanism in the control of mite proliferation. A transgenic mouse model (STAT(-/-) /CD28(-/-) ) has demonstrated that the immune response is complex, probably involving both cellular and humoral mechanisms and requiring the role of co-stimulatory molecules (CD28). It is known that a genetic predisposition for developing canine juvenile generalized demodicosis exists; however, the primary defect leading to the disease remains unknown. Once the mite proliferation is advanced, dogs show a phenotype that is similar to the T-cell exhaustion characterized by low interleukin-2 production and high interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor-β production by lymphocytes, as described in other viral and parasitic diseases. Acaricidal treatment (macrocyclic lactones) decreases the antigenic load and reverses T-cell exhaustion, leading to a clinical cure. Although in recent years there have been significant advances in the management and understanding of this important and complex canine disease, more research in areas such as the aetiology of the genetic predisposition and the immune control of the mite populations is clearly needed."
8136724	"Laparoscopic nephrectomy (LN) has been accepted for a donor in living donor kidney transplantation. However, the current status of LN in living donors is not yet clarified in Japan. In this study, we surveyed 138 Japanese kidney transplantation centers to investigate the outcomes of living donor LN in 2007. Of 138 centers, 107 responded, and 48 performed LN. These centers performed 840 living donor nephrectomies, including 623 LN and 217 open nephrectomies. Among 47 centers, 23 performed hand-assisted (HA) LN, 18 non-HA (pure laparoscopic), 3 both HA and non-HA, and 3 laparoscope-assisted. Seventeen centers utilized a peritoneal approach, 26 a retroperitoneal approach, and 4 both approaches. Among 623 LN donors, the 2 who had the life-threatening complications of bleeding and intestinal injury both survived. Blood transfusions were performed in 5 donors (0.8%). There were 8 (1.3%) open conversions from LN. Minor complications not requiring a longer hospital stay were reported in 10. There was no donor mortality after LN. However, among the recipients, there was 1 case of primary nonfunction. Thirteen recipients (2.0%) required hemodialysis after transplantation because of delayed graft function. Urinary tract complications were noted in 13 recipients (2.0%). This survey presented the current status of this procedure among donors who provided informed consent."
8505642	"In plant cells, flavonoids are synthesized in the cytosol and then are transported and accumulated in the vacuole. Glutathione S-transferase-mediated transport has been proposed as a mechanism involved in flavonoid transport, however, whether binding of flavonoids to glutathione S-transferase (GST) or their transport is glutathione-dependent is not well understood. Glutathione S-transferases from Vitis vinífera (VviGSTs) have been associated with the transport of anthocyanins, however, their ability to transport other flavonoids such as proanthocyanidins (PAs) has not been established. Following bioinformatics approaches, we analyzed the capability of VviGST1, VviGST3, VviGST4, and Arabidopsis TT19 to bind different flavonoids. Analyses of protein-ligand interactions indicate that these GSTs can bind glutathione and monomers of anthocyanin, PAs and flavonols. A total or partial overlap of the binding sites for glutathione and flavonoids was found in VviGST1, and a similar condition was observed in VviGST3 using anthocyanin and flavonols as ligands, whereas VviGST4 and TT19 have both sites for GSH and flavonoids separated. To validate the bioinformatics predictions, functional complementation assays using the Arabidopsis tt19 mutant were performed. Overexpression of VviGST3 in tt19-1 specifically rescued the dark seed coat phenotype associated to correct PA transport, which correlated with higher binding affinity for PA precursors. VviGST4, originally characterized as an anthocyanin-related GST, complemented both the anthocyanin and PA deposition, resembling the function of TT19. By contrast, VviGST1 only partially rescued the normal seed color. Furthermore the expression pattern of these VviGSTs showed that each of these genes could be associated with the accumulation of different flavonoids in specific tissues during grapevine fruit development. These results provide new insights into GST-mediated PA transport in grapevine and suggest that VviGSTs present different specificities for flavonoid ligands. In addition, our data provide evidence to suggest that GST-mediate flavonoid transport is glutathione-dependent."
7287061	"Skin disorders which require treatment are a common development in patients treated in intensive care units (ICUs). There are very few prospective studies about skin complications in adult ICUs.                                                                                  The aim of this study is to evaluate skin disorders in ICU-treated adult patients who were consulted for dermatological problems.                                                                              Eighty-two of 591 patients admitted to ICUs who were consulted for dermatological problems were included in the study. The correlation between skin complications and associated comorbidities, age, gender and ICU length of stay were analyzed.                                                                              Ninety dermatological complications were observed. Cutaneous drug reactions were significantly more frequent in female patients than males (p = 0.020). Candidal intertrigo was more frequent in diabetic patients than in nondiabetic patients (p = 0.042).                                                                                     Patients in ICUs may develop various skin disorders that need to be evaluated by dermatological consultations. Clinical features of the patients, especially gender and comorbidities, may predispose skin complications."
2996892	"Transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) is an effective treatment modality for chronic pain. Electrical impulses produced by a portable stimulator are transmitted by cable to electrodes which are attached to specific areas of the body by tape or adhesive. A conductive electrolyte jelly is utilized in order to make good electrical contact with the skin. Several dermatologic complications have been associated with the use of this technic, including allergic and irritant contact dermatitis and micropunctate burns caused by the improper use of poorly conductive lubricant jellies. A patient is reported herein who developed allergic contact dermatitis to propylene glycol in a conductive jelly (Neuromod TENS gel). In an attempt to continue therapy, the patient changed to a poorly conductive surgical lubricant jelly which caused irritation and micropunctate burns. Subsequently, electrodes not utilizing conductive jelly were applied, with excellent results."
5087930	"OLE1 encodes an oleosin isoprotein, a major membrane protein of the lipid-reserve organelle in seeds known as the oil body. Transgenic Arabidopsis were generated to contain an artificial chimeric transgene composed of OLE1 and green fluorescent protein (GFP). Overexpression of the fusion protein allowed visualization of the oil body size and structure in living cells using fluorescence microscopy. Two mutants, xrn4-8(OleG) and xrn4-9(OleG), accumulating enlarged oil bodies with reduced GFP fluorescence were isolated from the mutagenized progeny of a transgenic plant. Both mutants contained a defect in EXORIBONUCLEASE4 (XRN4), a gene known to encode a ribonuclease that specifically degrades uncapped mRNAs. Transgene expression was silenced in these mutants, as demonstrated by the reduced levels of the transgene mRNA and its product, OLE1-GFP. XRN4 loss of function also triggered cosuppression, i.e. simultaneous reduction in expression of the transgene and an endogenous OLE1 gene that shared a region of identical sequence. The enlarged oil bodies exhibiting reduced GFP fluorescence were formed in the xrn4-8(OleG) and xrn4-9(OleG) mutants due to the reduction of the endogenous OLE1 and the transgene product, OLE1-GFP, respectively. Cosuppression triggered by the xrn4 mutation also occurs for other genes such as PYK10, which encodes an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) body-resident β-glucosidase. The overall results indicate that a loss of XRN4 function can potentially trigger the cosuppression in a sequence-dependent manner."
6838517	"Cyanogenesis in Galegeae, Genisteae, Loteae and Phaseoleae, four tribes of Leguminosae-Papilionoideae, is discussed thoroughly. Oxytropis campestris (Galegeae) is shown to be facultatively cyanogenic (table I); cyanophoric plants contain a zierin-like glucoside. Lotononis crumaniana (Genisteae) is strongly cyanogenic and contains prunasin. Lotaustralin, accompanied by up to 5% Linamarin was demonstrated to be present in three taxa belonging to Dorycnium pentaphyllum sensu lato (table I). Leaves and stems of Phaseolus lunatus contain linamarin and perhaps trace amounts of lot-australin, but no taxiphyllin- or dhurrin-type glucosides."

9744153	"Phytochrome, a major photoreceptor in plants, consists of two domains: the N-terminal photosensory domain and the C-terminal domain. Recently, the 651-amino acid photosensory domain of phytochrome B (phyB) has been shown to act as a functional photoreceptor in the nucleus. The phytochrome (PHY) domain, which is located at the C-terminal end of the photosensory domain, is required for the spectral integrity of phytochrome; however, little is known about the signal transduction activity of this domain. Here, we have established transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana lines expressing an N-terminal 450-amino acid fragment of phyB (N450) lacking the PHY domain on a phyB-deficient background. Analysis of these plants revealed that N450 can act as an active photoreceptor when attached to a short nuclear localization signal and beta-glucuronidase. In vitro spectral analysis of reconstituted chromopeptides further indicated that the stability of the N450 Pfr form, an active form of phytochrome, is markedly reduced in comparison with the Pfr form of full-length phyB. Consistent with this, plants expressing N450 failed to respond to intermittent light applied at long intervals, indicating that N450 Pfr is short-lived in vivo. Taken together, our findings show that the PHY domain is dispensable for phyB signal transduction but is required for stabilizing the Pfr form of phyB."

3088118	"Synchronized cultures of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii were grown photoautotrophically under a wide range of environmental conditions including temperature (15-37 °C), different mean light intensities (132, 150, 264 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹), different illumination regimes (continuous illumination or alternation of light/dark periods of different durations), and culture methods (batch or continuous culture regimes). These variable experimental approaches were chosen in order to assess the role of temperature in the timing of cell division, the length of the cell cycle and its pre- and post-commitment phases. Analysis of the effect of temperature, from 15 to 37 °C, on synchronized cultures showed that the length of the cell cycle varied markedly from times as short as 14 h to as long as 36 h. We have shown that the length of the cell cycle was proportional to growth rate under any given combination of growth conditions. These findings were supported by the determination of the temperature coefficient (Q₁₀), whose values were above the level expected for temperature-compensated processes. The data presented here show that cell cycle duration in C. reinhardtii is a function of growth rate and is not controlled by a temperature independent endogenous timer or oscillator, including a circadian one."
3011836	"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a distressing disease associated with excoriations, pruritus, sleep disturbance, and elevation of serum total immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels.                                                                                  To evaluate whether serum IgE levels correlate with the symptomatology and plasma chemokine levels in children with AD.                                                                              AD patients aged younger than 18 years were recruited from the pediatric dermatology clinic of a university teaching hospital, and the AD severity was evaluated using the SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) index. Concentrations of serum total IgE, eosinophil count, and plasma AD-associated chemokines [cutaneous T-cell-attracting cytokine (CTACK), thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC)] were measured.                                                                              One hundred and seventeen Chinese children with AD (64 boys and 53 girls), with an age (mean +/- standard deviation) of 10.7 +/- 4.4 years, were recruited. Their overall SCORAD index (mean +/- standard deviation) was 51.1 +/- 22.8. The total serum IgE level divided by the age-specific upper limit (AE) correlated well with the extent and intensity of AD, except for oozing/crusting, which was significant only in males. There was a significant correlation between AE and pruritus or sleep loss only in females. Levels of IgE, CTACK, and TARC, and eosinophil count, differed significantly between patients with mild, moderate, and severe disease. AE correlated well with TARC (r = 0.50, P <    0.001) and eosinophil count (r = 0.41, P <    0.001), but not with CTACK (r = 0.11, P = 0.270). The prediction of moderate to severe eczema by AE gave an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.76 (95% confidence interval, 0.65-0.86; P = 0.004). An optimum positive predictive value of 94.2% was achieved with a cut-off point of AE of 2.95, sensitivity of 75.0%, and specificity of 66.7%.                                                                                     AE correlates significantly with various objective clinical scores and chemokine markers of AD, and is a useful indicator for predicting moderate to severe AD in children."
1090593	"We conducted a phase I-II study of transplantation conditioning with clofarabine-melphalan-alemtuzumab for patients with advanced hematologic malignancies. Ten patients were accrued to the phase I portion, which utilized an accelerated titration design. No dose-limiting toxicity was observed, and clofarabine 40 mg/m(2) × 5, melphalan 140 mg/m(2) × 1, and alemtuzumab 20 mg × 5 was adopted for the phase II study, which accrued 72 patients. Median age was 54 years. There were 44 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes, 27 with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and nine patients with other hematologic malignancies. The largest subgroup of 35 patients had American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation high-risk, active disease. All evaluable patients engrafted with a median time to neutrophil and platelet recovery of 10 and 18 days, respectively. The cumulative incidence of treatment-related mortality was 26% at 1 year. Cumulative incidence of relapse was 29% at 1 year. Overall survival was 80% (95% confidence interval [CI], 71-89) at 100 days and 59% (95% CI, 47-71) at 1 year. Progression-free-survival was 45% (95% CI, 33-67) at 1 year. Rapid-onset renal failure was the main toxicity in the phase II study and more frequent in older patients and those with baseline decrease in glomerular filtration rate. Grade 3-5 renal toxicity was observed in 16 of 74 patients (21%) treated at the phase II doses. Clofarabine-melphalan-alemtuzumab conditioning yields promising response and duration of response, but renal toxicity poses a considerable risk particularly in older patients."
6055350	"The chronic course of atopic dermatitis is a problem for children and their families: it can be extremely disabling, and may cause psychologic problems for both child and family. As atopic dermatitis affects 10% of the pediatric population, pediatricians and dermatologists spend much time on the treatment of this disease, which requires a multidisciplinary approach. To improve the quality of life of children and families affected by atopic dermatitis we have offered an educational program to the parents of young children affected by the disease. The program consists of six meetings at weekly intervals involving a pediatric allergist, a dermatologist, and a psychologist. Our experience has been positive. This type of program may help to improve the quality of life of families with children affected by atopic dermatitis. Lower levels of anxiety were observed among parents at the end of the program. We believe that educational programs of this type, in association with conventional treatment, can be useful in the long term management of the disease. They may be considered to improve the quality of life of the family and children and to create more interaction and compliance between physicians, parents, and children."
7503358	"The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is known to be a negative regulator of legume root nodule formation. By screening Lotus japonicus seedlings for survival on an agar medium containing 70 μM ABA, we obtained mutants that not only showed increased root nodule number, but also enhanced nitrogen fixation. The mutant was designated enf1 (enhanced nitrogen fixation 1) and was confirmed to be monogenic and incompletely dominant. In long-term growth experiments with M. loti, although some yield parameters were the same for both enf1 and wild-type plants, both the dry weight and N content of 100 seeds and entire enf1 plants were significantly larger compared than those traits in wild-type seeds and plants. The augmentation of the weight and N content of the enf1 plants most likely reflects the increased N supplied by the additional enf1 nodules and the concomitant increase in N fixation activity. We determined that the endogenous ABA concentration and the sensitivity to ABA of enf1 were lower than that of wild-type seedlings. When wild-type plants were treated with abamine, a specific inhibitor of 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED), which results in reduced ABA content, the N fixation activity of abamine-treated plants was elevated to the same levels as enf1. We also determined that production of nitric oxide (NO) in enf1 nodules was decreased. We conclude that endogenous ABA concentration not only regulates nodulation, but also nitrogen fixation activity by decreasing NO production in nodules."
3967305	"This follow-up study of 58 heart recipients an average of 2 years after transplantation did not show that the Symptom Checklist 90R, a self-report measure of psychologic distress, predicted medical outcome. Mortality and medical morbidity (graft rejection and infection rate) were the outcome variables used. The findings tend to argue against the validity of some aspects of the psychiatric screening of transplant candidates if prediction of patients' ultimate risk of mortality or medical morbidity is the validation standard."
6459337	"Given that an important functional attribute of stem cells in vivo is their ability to sustain tissue regeneration, we set out to establish a simple and easy technique to assess this property from candidate populations of human keratinocyte stem cells in an in vivo setting. Keratinocytes were inoculated into devitalized rat tracheas and transplanted subcutaneously into SCID mice, and the epithelial lining regenerated characterized to establish the validity of this heterotypic model. Furthermore, the rate and quality of epidermal tissue reconstitution obtained from freshly isolated unfractionated vs. keratinocyte stem cell-enriched populations was tested as a function of (a) cell numbers inoculated; and (b) the inclusion of irradiated support keratinocytes and dermal cells. Rapid and sustained epidermal tissue regeneration from small numbers of freshly isolated human keratinocyte stem cells validates the utilization of this simple and reliable model system to assay for enrichment of epidermal tissue-reconstituting cells."
8694527	"Supplemental irrigation with low-quality water will be paramount in Mediterranean agriculture in the future, where durum wheat is a major crop. Breeding for salinity tolerance may contribute towards improving resilience to irrigation with brackish water. However, identification of appropriate phenotyping traits remains a bottleneck in breeding. A set of 25 genotypes, including 19 landraces and 6 improved varieties most cultivated in Tunisia, were grown in the field and irrigated with brackish water (6, 13 and 18dSm(-1)). Improved genotypes exhibited higher grain yield (GY) and water use efficiency at the crop level (WUEyield or 'water productivity'), shorter days to flowering (DTF), lower N concentration (N) and carbon isotope composition (δ(13)C) in mature kernels and lower nitrogen isotope composition (δ(15)N) in the flag leaf compared with landraces. GY was negatively correlated with DTF and the δ(13)C and N of mature kernels and was positively correlated with the δ(15)N of the flag leaf. Moreover, δ(13)C of mature kernels was negatively correlated with WUEyield. The results highlight the importance of shorter phenology together with photosynthetic resilience to salt-induced water stress (lower δ(13)C) and nitrogen metabolism (higher N and δ(15)N) for assessing genotypic performance to salinity."
5793858	"Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is the most common malignancy after solid organ transplantation, with an increased risk of recurrence and metastasis over the general population. The newly updated 7th edition American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system for cSCC is based on consensus expert opinion and requires validation in large cohort studies and in specific patient subpopulations.                                                                                  Our objective was to evaluate the risk of cSCC recurrence in a high-risk population of heart and lung transplant recipients, based on the 7th edition AJCC staging system.                                                                              We performed a 10-year retrospective cohort study of all primary cSCC diagnosed in heart and lung transplant recipients at a tertiary care academic dermatology center.                                                                              The cumulative incidence of local recurrence was 4% for cSCC in situ and 19% for stage I cSCC at 5 years, and 54% for stage II cSCC at 3 years. Stage II tumors had a 10-fold greater risk of recurrence than stage I, and a 43-fold greater risk of recurrence than in situ tumors.                                                                                      This study is limited to a specific patient subgroup at a tertiary care center, and may not be generalizable to all populations.                                                                                      Heart and lung transplant recipients are at high risk for local recurrence of cSCC. These data substantiate the prognostic accuracy of the newly updated 7th edition AJCC staging system for stage 0, I, and II cSCC in this population and demonstrate the aggressive behavior of this cancer in immunosuppressed patients."

In this case report, we evaluate the efficacy, safety and viral resistance after topical foscarnet in severe genital ulceration due to acyclovir-resistant HSV-2.                                                                                  A 45-year-old African woman was known for an HIV infection with severe immunosuppression (CD4 <   100/mm3). She had received a long-term prophylaxis with acyclovir (400 mg b.i.d.) for a recurrent genital herpes. Few weeks after stopping this prophylaxis, she developed large genital ulcerations progressing despite valacyclovir treatment (1,000 mg t.i.d.). Cultures were positive for HSV-2, resistance to acyclovir was shown by the plaque reduction assay and topical foscarnet was tried. Treatment consisted of a 20-min application of topical foscarnet 2.4% twice a day. Dramatic improvement was observed with rapid antalgia, and cicatrization of the genital ulcerations was observed after 50 days. HSV could not be detected on the mucosal surface. Initially, HSV-2 was resistant to acyclovir but sensitive to foscarnet. After 1 month of topical treatment, HSV-2 became sensitive to acyclovir and was still sensitive to foscarnet. Finally, after 6 weeks of treatment, no virus could be detected by culture.                                                                                     Topical foscarnet (2.4%) is a convenient treatment for chronic genital herpes. Resistance to acyclovir disappears few weeks after stopping this drug and sensitivity to foscarnet persists during the 50 days of treatment."
7131638	"Intrahepatic biliary stricture (IHBS) after liver transplantation (LT) may develop in patients with hepatic artery thrombosis, chronic rejection, or ABO incompatibility, as well as in patients with prolonged warm ischemia in non-heart-beating donor (NHBD) LT. However, the clinical course and methods of management have not been well defined for IHBSs to date. Thus, the purpose of this study was to provide a classification of post-LT IHBS and to investigate patient prognosis. Forty-four patients who developed IHBS after NHBD LT were enrolled. On the basis of the cholangiographic appearance, patients were classified into 4 groups: unilateral focal (UF, n=8), confluence (CO, n=10), bilateral multifocal (BM, n=21), and diffuse necrosis (DN, n=5). The UF type was defined as cases with stricture only in the segmental branch of the unilateral hemiliver; the CO type in cases with several strictures at confluence level; and the BM type in cases with multiple strictures bilaterally. Cases with diffuse obliteration of peripheral ducts or destruction of the central architectural integrity, over a long segment, were classified as the DN type. Five patients with the CO type required several interventions requiring biliary dilatation, yet all patients with the UF or CO type had a good prognosis. Among the patients with the BM type, 3 patients (14.3%) died or underwent retransplantation due to biliary complications, and 7 (33.3%) required repeated interventions for >   1 year without improvement. Moreover, among 5 patients classified as the DN type, 1 (20%) died of biliary sepsis, 2 (40%) underwent retransplantation, and the remaining 2 (40%) did not recover from persistent jaundice and life-threatening cholangitis despite multiple interventions. In conclusion, all patients classified as UF or CO had a good outcome with or without additional interventions. However, all patients with the DN type and about half the patients with the BM type did not recover from life-threatening complications, despite repeated aggressive interventions; early retransplantation was therefore the only treatment option for these patients."
4864813	"It is known that oestrogen influences skin wound healing by modulating the inflammatory response, cytokine expression and extracellular matrix deposition; accelerating re-epithelialization; and stimulating angiogenesis. To identify novel proteins associated with effects of oestrogen on keratinocyte, stable isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based mass spectrometry was performed. Using SILAC, quantification of 1085 proteins was achieved. Among these proteins, 60 proteins were upregulated and 32 proteins were downregulated. Among significantly upregulated proteins, high-mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1) has been further evaluated for its role in the effect of oestrogen on keratinocytes. HMGB1 expression was strongly induced in oestrogen-treated keratinocytes in dose- and time-dependent manner. Further, HMGB1 was able to significantly accelerate the rate of HaCaT cell migration. To determine whether HMGB1 is involved in E2-induced HaCaT cell migration, cells were transfected with HMGB1 siRNA. Knockdown of HMGB1 blocked oestrogen-induced keratinocyte migration. Collectively, these experiments demonstrate that HMGB1 is a novel downstream mediator of oestrogen-stimulated keratinocyte migration."

Surgical excision and sclerotherapy are the first-lines therapeutic options, but in certain areas such as the genitalia can be too aggressive. We present a case of VM on the glans penis treated successfully with dual wavelength 595 and 1064 nm laser system."
1619691	"Zinc-metalloproteases, such as neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), effectively control the bioavailability of peptide mediators released from sensory nerves, immune and skin cells during the cutaneous response to endogenous or exogenous noxious stimuli. Functional inactivation of NEP or ACE by transient inhibition or permanent genomic deletion results in a relative abundance of substance P (SP) and bradykinin (BK); this augments murine allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) by affecting ACD sensitization and elicitation, which involves neurokinin 1 receptors (NK1), BK receptors (B2) and an intact cutaneous sensory nervous system. Present evidence suggests that increased SP via NK(1) is capable of boosting important functions of SP- and NK1-expressing dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells (TCs) in an auto- or paracrine manner, which promotes ACD antigen sensitization. Moreover, skin inflammation or wounding in vivo, as well as treatment of epidermal and dermal cells by UV light and inflammatory mediators in vitro, regulates NEP and ACE expression and activity. Likewise, NEP and ACE are capable of processing neuroendocrine hormones, such as adrenocorticotropin and alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone. Thus, present data indicate that ACE and NEP, via proteolytic cleavage of peptide mediators and growth factors, represent important control factors for the inflammatory response in skin disorders such as psoriasis or allergic inflammation, but may also be capable of affecting pigmentation, cell survival, wound healing and tissue regeneration."
2901695	"Clinical manifestations of cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) vary widely, and different subtypes of this autoimmune disease exist. Tumidus subtype (LT) has been recently separated from the chronic subtypes and is now considered an independent entity due to its particular clinical and histological features. Different treatments are usually prescribed for CLE. Our group has experience of CLE effectively treated with pulsed dye laser (PDL). It was our impression that better responses were achieved in the LT subtype, but no controlled prospective studies with PDL have been specifically performed.                                                                                            A prospective study was performed on 10 patients with histologically confirmed LT treated with PDL. All patients were treated with 595 nm PDL using the 10 mm spot size at 0.5 ms pulse width and a fluence of 8 J/cm(2). Biopsies were taken before and 4 weeks after treatment and were stained with haematoxylin-eosin.                                                                              Evaluation after PDL treatment showed clinical improvement in all of them without side-effects and reduction of the dermal lymphocytic infiltrate in 9/10 of the patients. Epidermal changes were absent in all patients. Mucin deposition persisted only in one patient. However, 50% of the patients developed new lesions nearby or distant to the treated zones.                                                                                      PDL therapy is an effective and fast treatment option for acute flares of LT; however, it does not prevent recurrences. A histological improvement has been confirmed in this study. Purpura seems to be necessary to achieve a good response."
1827443	"A case of a 7-year-old girl with microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) with a skin eruption characterized by maculopapular, erythematous and purpuric lesions on the face, elbows, and knees is presented. Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA) with myeloperoxidase specificity (MPO-ANCA) were identified. Chest X-ray and computed tomography scan revealed diffuse infiltrates in both lung fields, suggesting alveolar hemorrhage. Microscopic hematuria was detected but a renal biopsy showed no abnormalities. Histological examination of a skin biopsy from a purpuric papule showed leukocytoclastic vasculitis of the small vessels in the entire dermis. The patient was treated with prednisolone and mizoribine, resulting in an improvement in the skin lesions except for those on the knee."
2573241	The Leicester Royal Infirmary serves a large immigrant community from the Indian subcontinent. We surveyed referrals to the Dermatology Department over the months of November 1986 and September 1987. In both surveys atopic dermatitis (AD) was significantly more common among the Asian patients.
8990899	"We report a 43-year-old woman, who underwent therapy with interferon-α for hairy cell leukemia. During interferon-α therapy she developed multiple subcutaneous swellings, accompanied by fever and fatigue. A skin biopsy revealed lobular, T-cell lymphocytic panniculitis. In conjunction with the clinical and immunological findings, the diagnosis of lupus panniculitis was made and interferon-α therapy stopped. Initially, she responded well to oral prednisone and hydroxychloroquine, but after several months she became resistant to it. Her condition worsened, she developed skin ulcers in the inflamed regions. Only with the leukemia-targeted therapy using cladribine and rituximab her skin condition could be controlled, suggesting hairy cell leukemia as an additional trigger of the lupus panniculitis. Our report is the first one to show induction of lupus panniculitis under interferon therapy of hairy cell leukemia and its presumable sustentation by the latter."
9364715	"Follicular lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) describes a variant of LyP with perifollicular infiltrates and some degree of folliculotropism of CD30(+) atypical lymphocytes. So far, only a few cases of follicular LyP have been described.                                                                                  Our goal was to study the clinicopathologic features of follicular LyP in a series of 11 cases (9 male, 2 female; age range 7-78 years, mean age 50 years).                                                                              In all, 113 cases of LyP were reviewed to select cases showing follicular involvement. Histology was correlated with the clinical data to exclude cases of CD30(+) anaplastic large-cell lymphoma or folliculotropic mycosis fungoides.                                                                              Six cases were classified as type C and 4 as type A, whereas the remaining case manifested epidermotropism of small lymphocytes in a background of a typical type A lesion (overlapping type A/B). Perifollicular infiltrates of CD30(+) atypical lymphoid cells were seen in all 11 cases, with infiltration of the follicular epithelium in 8 cases. Hyperplasia of the follicular epithelium was observed in 4 cases; ruptured hair follicles, in 3 cases; and follicular mucinosis, in 2 cases. In addition to hair follicle infiltration, atypical cells were recognized within sebaceous glands in 2 lesions. New findings were presence of numerous intrafollicular neutrophils in 2 patients, who clinically had pustules in addition to papules. Other histopathological features encountered included perieccrine infiltration (n = 5), focal subcutaneous involvement (n = 4), granulomatous inflammation (n = 3), epidermal hyperplasia (n = 2), and 1 each of infiltration of muscle bundles, numerous eosinophils in the infiltrate, and angiocentricity.                                                                                      This was a retrospective study.                                                                                      Follicular LyP is a variant of LyP with involvement of hair follicles, mostly in the form of perifollicular infiltrate with variable degree of folliculotropism. Other changes including hyperplasia of the follicular epithelium, rupture of hair follicle, and follicular mucinosis are less common. Rarely, intrafollicular pustules can be seen in the follicular epithelium; such lesions manifest clinically as pustules."
5487126	"Epigenetic alterations are increasingly recognized as mechanisms for disease-associated changes in genome function and important risk factors for complex diseases. The epigenome differs between cell types and so far has been characterized in few human tissues only. In order to identify disease-associated DNA methylation differences for atopic dermatitis (AD), we investigated DNA from whole blood, T cells, B cells, as well as lesional and non-lesional epidermis from AD patients and healthy controls. To elicit functional links, we examined epidermal mRNA expression profiles. No genome-wide significant DNA methylation differences between AD cases and controls were observed in whole blood, T cells, and B cells, and, in general, intra-individual differences in DNA methylation were larger than interindividual differences. However, striking methylation differences were observed between lesional epidermis from patients and healthy control epidermis for various CpG sites, which partly correlated with altered transcript levels of genes predominantly relevant for epidermal differentiation and innate immune response. Significant DNA methylation differences were discordant in skin and blood samples, suggesting that blood is not an ideal surrogate for skin tissue. Our pilot study provides preliminary evidence for functionally relevant DNA methylation differences associated with AD, particularly in the epidermis, and represents a starting point for future investigations of epigenetic mechanisms in AD."

5039856	"In the cell walls of grasses, ferulic acid is esterified to arabinoxylans and undergoes oxidative reactions to form ferulates dimers, trimers and oligomers. Feruloylation of arabinoxylan is considered important not only because it leads to cross-linked xylans but also because ferulates may act as a nucleating site for the formation of lignin and hence link arabinoxylans to lignin by forming a lignin-ferulate-arabinoxylan complex. Such cross-linking is among the main factors inhibiting the release of fermentable carbohydrates from grasses either for ruminant nutrition or for biofuel production. We have found that significant reductions in the levels of monomeric and dimeric phenolics can be achieved in the growing cell walls during plant development in leaves of Festuca arundinacea by constitutive intracellular targeted expression of Aspergillus niger ferulic acid esterase (FAEA). We propose that this occurred by directly disrupting ester bonds linking phenolics to cell wall polysaccharides by apoplast targeting or by preventing excessive feruloylation of cell wall carbohydrates prior to their incorporation into the cell wall, by targeting to the Golgi membrane system. Plants with lower cell wall ferulate levels, which showed increased digestibility and increased rates of cellulase-mediated release of fermentable sugars, were identified. Targeting FAE to the Golgi was found to be more effective than targeting to the ER, which supports the current theories of the Golgi as the site of feruloylation of arabinoxylans. It is concluded that targeting FAEA expression to the Golgi or apoplast is likely to be an effective strategy for improving wall digestibility in grass species used for fodder or cellulosic ethanol production."
9668508	"The prevalence of dysplastic cutaneous lesions was determined in a group of 68 renal transplant patients whose immunosuppressive therapy included cyclosporine but not azathioprine. The mean age of the patients was 41 years (range 17-67), and the mean transplant time was 44 months (range 24-75). Dysplastic cutaneous lesions were found in 14 out of 68 patients, a prevalence of 20.6%. Although the lesions arose on sun-exposed sites, there was no apparent correlation with previous sun-exposure. The cumulative prevalence of dysplastic cutaneous lesions in 64 patients who had received cyclosporine for between 24 and 72 months was compared with 33 renal transplant patients who had been treated with azathioprine over a similar period of time. The overall prevalence of cutaneous dysplasia was 22% in the cyclosporine group and 9% in the azathioprine group. The cumulative prevalence of cutaneous dysplasia in the cyclosporine group was greater at all time points studied. In contrast to previous reports, we have found no evidence that the risk of cutaneous malignancy in patients treated with cyclosporine is less than that found in patients maintained on azathioprine."
4667071	"Dark-grown Euglena gracilis strain Z were exposed to white light which induces chloroplast development including a massive formation of thylakoid membranes. Thylakoid membranes were isolated from greening cells at various times from 12 to 72 h following light-exposure. The temporal appearance in the membranes of the three main chlorophyll-protein complexes (CP1, CPa, LHCP) and the N,N(1)?dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD)-binding CF(0)-IH subunit of the coupling-factor ATPase was assessed. When the cells were greened on a medium containing the readily-metabolized carbon source, ethanol, LHCP was detected as early as 12 h, and both CP1 and CPa were detected in low quantity up to 36 h and then increased. CP1, CPa and LHCP were detected as green complexes on polyacrylamide gels earalier during greening when cells were greened on resting medium compared to cells greened in the presence of ethanol. Photosystem I activity was detected at 12 h, photosystem II activity at 18 to 24 h, and water-splitting and whole electron transport chain activities after 24 h. Correlations are made between the temporal appearances of these activities and of the chlorophyll-protein complexes. The DCCD- binding CF(0)-IH was detected in the membrane at 12 h and increased in amount thereafter."
4671565	"The case we report is about a female patient, 69 years old, who had a hypertrophic scarring on the right cheek because of a bite by her dog. She had attempted many types of topical and intralesional treatments but without success. The patient underwent photodynamic therapy (PDT), employing a methyl ester of 5-aminolevulinic acid (MAL) as topical photosensitizer and a non-coherent red light at a wavelength of 632 nm. This session was then repeated three more times at 2-week intervals. A month after the last session, the scarred area significantly softened, becoming more flexible, less erythematous, smoother and reduced in volume. The patient was greatly satisfied with the clinical and cosmetic result, she had no more than rough scarring on the cheek, and her skin in the area around the lesion was very smooth, wrinkle-free. She did not show any recurrence of her hypertrophic scarring after 1 year of follow-up. PDT revealed to be the most effective approach if compared with previous therapeutic options received by the patient, but further studies are necessary to evaluate protocols to be used for the best results in this kind of application."

Patients with psoriasis (n = 130) were investigated for serum IgG and IgA AGA, IgA antitransglutaminase antibody and IgA antiendomysial antibody. Disease characteristics and associated bowel and joint symptoms were determined. All patients were invited to undertake endoscopy with duodenal biopsy.                                                                              A significantly higher proportion of patients with elevated CD-associated antibody levels was currently on or had previously required systemic immunosuppressants (methotrexate, ciclosporin or etretinate; P = 0.04) or psoralen plus ultraviolet A phototherapy (P = 0.03). One case of CD was diagnosed.

3196858	"Copper amine oxidases (CuAO) and flavin-containing amine oxidases (PAO) are hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))-producing enzymes responsible for the oxidative de-amination of polyamines. Currently, a key role has been ascribed to apoplastic amine oxidases in plants, i.e., to behave as H(2)O(2)-delivering systems in the cell wall during cell growth and differentiation as well as in the context of host-pathogen interactions. Indeed, H(2)O(2) is the co-substrate for the peroxidase-driven reactions during cell-wall maturation and a key signalling molecule in defence mechanisms. We recently demonstrated the involvement of an apoplastic PAO in the wound-healing process of the Zea mays mesocotyl. Experimental evidence indicated a similar role for an apoplastic PAO in Nicotiana tabacum. In this addendum we suggest that a CuAO activity is also involved in this healing event."
7240660	"A papain-type cysteine endopeptidase with a molecular mass of 35 kDa for the mature enzyme, was purified from germinating castor bean (Ricinus communis L.) endosperm by virtue of its capacity to process the glyoxysomal malate dehydrogenase precursor protein to the mature subunit in vitro (C. Gietl et al., 1997, Plant Physiol 113: 863-871). The cDNA clones from endosperm of germinating seedlings and from developing seeds were isolated and sequence analysis revealed that a very similar or identical peptidase is synthesised in both tissues. Sequencing established a presequence for co-translational targeting into the endoplasmic reticulum, an N-terminal propeptide and a C-terminal KDEL motif for the castor bean cysteine endopeptidase precursor. The 45-kDa pro-enzyme stably present in isolated organelles was enzymatically active. Immunocytochemistry with antibodies raised against the purified cysteine endopeptidase revealed highly specific labelling of ricinosomes, organelles which co-purify with glyoxysomes from germinating Ricinus endosperm. The cysteine endopeptidase from castor bean endosperm, which represents a senescing tissue, is homologous to cysteine endopeptidases from other senescing tissues such as the cotyledons of germinating mung bean (Vigna mungo) and vetch (Vicia sativa), the seed pods of maturing French bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and the flowers of daylily (Hemerocallis sp.)."
3733543	"Previous genetic evidence suggested that the fad8 and fad7 genes of Arabidopsis thaliana encode chloroplast membrane-associated omega-3 desaturases. A putative fad8 cDNA was isolated by heterologous hybridization using a gene encoding an endoplasmic reticulum-localized omega-3 desaturase (fad3) as a probe. The cDNA encodes a protein of 435 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 50,134 D. Constitutive expression of the cDNA in transgenic plants of a fad7 mutant resulted in genetic complementation of the mutation, indicating that the fad7 and fad8 gene products are functionally equivalent. Expression of the fad8 cDNA in transgenic plants often resulted in the co-suppression of both the endogenous fad7 and fad8 genes in spite of the fact that these two genes share only about 75% nucleotide identity. In contrast to all other known plant desaturases, including fad7, the steady-state level of fad8 mRNA is strongly increased in plants grown at low temperature. This suggests that the role of fad8 is to provide increased omega-3 desaturase activity in plants that are exposed to low growth temperature. The fad8-1 mutation created a premature stop codon 149 amino acids from the amino-terminal end of the fad8 open reading frame, suggesting that this mutation results in a complete loss of fad8 activity."
4789996	"The endosperm of Euphorbia lagascae Spreng. seeds contains high levels of the epoxidated fatty acid vernolic acid [12(S),13(R)-epoxy-12-octadecenoic acid]. To learn more about the function and metabolism of vernolic acid, we have initiated an investigation into the gene activities involved in the processes of vernolic acid mobilization and oxidation during germination. Here we report the cloning and characterization of a soluble epoxide hydrolase from E. lagascae. Epoxide hydrolases are a group of functionally related enzymes that catalyze the co-factor-independent hydrolysis of epoxides to their corresponding vicinal diols by the addition of a water molecule. A detailed investigation of the transcription pattern of the E. lagascae epoxide hydrolase gene shows that it is induced during germination. Results from in situ hybridization show that the gene is expressed in the cotyledons and in the hypocotyl. We conclude that soluble epoxide hydrolase plays an important role during germination of E. lagascae seeds."
9649602	"Mutations in the filaggrin (FLG) gene are strongly associated with common dermatological disorders such as atopic dermatitis. However, the exact underlying pathomechanism is still ambiguous. Here, we investigated the impact of FLG on skin lipid composition, organization, and skin acidification using a FLG knockdown (FLG-) skin construct. Initially, sodium/hydrogen antiporter (NHE-1) activity was sufficient to maintain the acidic pH (5.5) of the reconstructed skin. At day 7, the FLG degradation products urocanic (UCA) and pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid (PCA) were significantly decreased in FLG- constructs, but the skin surface pH was still physiological owing to an upregulation of NHE-1. At day 14, secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) IIA, which converts phospholipids to fatty acids, was significantly more activated in FLG- than in FLG+. Although NHE-1 and sPLA2 were able to compensate the FLG deficiency, maintain the skin surface pH, and ensured ceramide processing (no differences detected), an accumulation of free fatty acids (2-fold increase) led to less ordered intercellular lipid lamellae and higher permeability of the FLG- constructs. The interplay of the UCA/PCA and the sPLA2/NHE-1 acidification pathways of the skin and the impact of FLG insufficiency on skin lipid composition and organization in reconstructed skin are described."
6718917	"Studies focusing on the targeting of RNAs that encode rice storage proteins, prolamines and glutelins to specific sub-domains of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), as well as mis-localization studies of other storage protein RNAs, indicate a close relationship between the ER site of RNA translation and the final site of protein deposition in the endomembrane system in developing rice endosperm. In addition to prolamine and glutelin, rice accumulates smaller amounts of α-globulins, which are deposited together with glutelin in the protein storage vacuole (PSV). In situ RT-PCR analysis revealed that α-globulin RNAs are not distributed to the cisternal ER as expected for a PSV-localized protein, but instead are targeted to the protein body-ER (PB-ER) by a regulated process requiring cis-sorting sequences. Sequence alignments with putative maize δ-zein cis-localization elements identified several candidate regulatory sequences that may be responsible for PB-ER targeting. Immunocytochemical analysis confirmed the presence of α-globulin on the periphery of the prolamine protein bodies and packaging in Golgi-associated dense vesicles, as well as deposition and storage within peripheral regions of the PSV. Mis-targeting of α-globulin RNAs to the cisternal ER dramatically alters the spatial arrangement of α-globulin and glutelin within the PSV, with the accompanying presence of numerous small α-globulin particles in the cytoplasm. These results indicate that α-globulin RNA targeting to the PB-ER sub-domain is essential for efficient transport of α-globulins to the PSV and its spatial arrangement in the PSV. Such RNA localization prevents potential deleterious protein-protein interactions, in addition to performing a role in protein targeting."
4492483	"Albuminuria (>   30 mg/day) based on 24 h urine albumin excretion is one of the criteria for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and a predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Differences in urine albumin concentration and creatinine excretion rates between Indo-Asians and other populations may require different threshold values for detection of albuminuria. We compared the use of spot urine albumin concentration and urine albumin to creatinine excretion ratio for detection of albuminuria in this population.                                                                              A total of 577 subjects aged >   or=40 years, 54% of whom were women, were recruited from the general population in Karachi, Pakistan. Albumin concentration (mg/l) and albumin to creatinine ratio (mg/g of creatinine) were determined in a spot morning urine sample, and albuminuria (30 mg/day or greater) measured in a 24 h urine collected on the subsequent day.                                                                              The median (25-75 percentile) of urine albumin excretion was 4.8 (3.6-10.3) mg/day: 5.4 (3.7-12.5) mg/day in men and 4.5 (3.8-8.9) mg/day in women. The overall prevalence (95% CI) of albuminuria was 11.8% (7.2-12.0%): 14.8% in men and 9.2% in women (P = 0.04). The areas under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves for urine albumin concentration were 0.86 (0.82-0.90) and 0.88 (0.84-0.92), respectively, in women and men. The areas under the ROC curves for albumin to creatinine ratio were 0.86 (0.82-0.89) and 0.90 (0.86-0.93), respectively, in women and men. For urine albumin concentration, the sensitivity and specificity were 37 and 97%, respectively, in women and 69 and 94%, respectively, in men at the conventionally recommended value of 2 mg/dl. The discriminator value of urine albumin concentration identified in the analysis was 0.5 mg/dl in women (sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 75%) and 1.7 mg/dl in men (sensitivity of 74% and specificity of 93%). For the albumin to creatinine ratio, the sensitivity and specificity were 46 and 95%, respectively, in women and 60 and 97%, respectively, in men at cut-off value of 30 mg/g.                                                                                     Both urine albumin concentration and albumin to creatinine ratio are acceptable tests for population screening for albuminuria in Indo-Asians. While sensitivities may be suboptimal, particularly in women, lowering the existing thresholds would compromise specificity. Those who screen positive need evaluation and management of CKD and prevention of CVD."
7875619	"To preserve oral function and achieve acceptable cosmetic results, intraoperative control of surgical margins with frozen section evaluation may help to determine surgical technique in lip cancer. However, frozen section analysis is usually limited to suspicious areas and has not been systematically performed among surgeons. The accuracy of such analysis for detecting histological surgical margins is highly dependent on the methods used to obtain and analyze the margins. Improving the pathodiagnostic reliability of conventional intraoperative frozen section evaluation is the most important goal of surgical management in our method. We describe the successful use of the ""double-blade method"" in lip cancer treatment. The technique we describe has the advantage of histologically confirming clear margins in lip cancer. This method appears to be time-saving and easy to apply with existing surgical systems. In addition, this method may be used as an alternative to complete evaluation of lateral surgical margins that is important in planning a suitable surgical reconstruction procedure in lip cancer at many institutions where Mohs micrographic surgery is difficult to perform."

8092759	"To assess the risk of developing a basal cell carcinoma (BCC), and/or a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and/or Bowen disease (SCC in situ) after a nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) of a specific type.                                                                                   Four electronic databases were searched from January 1, 1966, to October 21, 1999.                                                                                      We included all studies published in English, identified by standard search strategies, that provided original data quantifying the risk of an NMSC among persons with a previous NMSC.                                                                                      For each study and separate histological type of index skin tumor and subsequent skin tumor (SCC, BCC, NMSC, or Bowen disease), we determined the 3-year cumulative risk and the incidence rate of second tumors per 100 000 person-years. In cases where more than 1 study was assessing the risk of one specific tumor type after another, we undertook a formal meta-analysis. We compared the incidence of a subsequent SCC after an index SCC and of a subsequent BCC after an index BCC with the incidence of the first occurrence of such tumors in the comparable general population.                                                                                     We identified and reviewed 17 studies that included data for 26 tumor combinations. Overall, the 3-year cumulative risk of a subsequent SCC after an index SCC is 18%, at least a 10-fold increase in incidence compared with the incidence of first tumors in a comparable general population. For BCCs, the 3-year cumulative risk is 44%, also at least a 10-fold increase in incidence compared with the rate in a comparable general population. The risk of developing a BCC in patients with a prior SCC is about equal to that risk among persons with a prior BCC, but the risk of developing an SCC in patients with a prior BCC is low (6%).                                                                                      Although these studies vary in their study type, location, and biases, their results are consistent. The risk of developing a subsequent skin cancer of a specific type depends on the type of prior NMSC and number of prior skin tumors of that type. Based on these findings, follow-up strategies for patients with BCC and SCC are suggested."
2992278	"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection after liver transplantation (LT) is associated with increased risk of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). Lowering immunosuppression is the current method to prevent PTLD in LT children with a high viral load. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of valganciclovir (VGCV) in children with EBV infection after LT. Forty-seven children showing detectable EBV-DNA (72% asymptomatic) were treated with VGCV (520 mg/sqm twice daily) with no immunosuppression decrease (except in 4 cases). VGCV treatment started 17 months (median) after the onset of EBV infection. A 30-day treatment applied to 26 patients led to undetectable EBV-DNA in 11/32 courses (34.3%), with 82% relapsing. A long VGCV treatment (median: 8 months) achieved undetectable EBV-DNA in 20/42 (47.6%), 60% of whom maintained response off therapy. There were no new PTLD cases. Symptoms worsened in 1 (2.1%) in whom PTLD was suspected but not confirmed in liver and jejunum biopsies. Factors associated with achievement of undetectable EBV-DNA were a longer time from LT and a lower rate of intervening infections in comparison with nonresponders. The safety profile for VGCV was excellent. Graft rejection occurred in 6%. In conclusion, in 47 LT children with a sustained increased EBV load treated with VGCV and unchanged immunosuppression, PTLD was suspected in 1 child (2.1%). A viral load decrease could be achieved as EBV-DNA was undetectable in 47% of patients under prolonged treatment."
2711609	We report a case of typical Letterer-Siwe disease associated with a subacute monocytic leukemia in a 75-year-old man. The simultaneous presentation of both diseases is rare.

2917746	"Systemic therapy is required in patients with severe atopic dermatitis (AD) refractory to adequate topical therapy. The aim of a systemic therapy is the rapid and efficient improvement of skin symptoms and pruritus in acute exacerbation and/or the long-term control of severe chronic disease. A number of immunosuppressive and immunomodulating substances are available that may efficiently reduce skin inflammation and thus lead to a relief of symptoms including pruritus. The excellent effects of cyclosporine as short-term as well as maintenance therapy have been documented in several studies in children and adults. Furthermore, other immunosuppressive substances such as azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil and methotrexate are effective in patients with moderate to severe AD. Intravenous immunoglobulins and γ-interferon exert immunomodulatory effects and thus may improve severe AD. Biological agents are a new approach in AD therapy since they may specifically target cells, cytokines or mediators involved in the pathogenesis of AD."

5140891	"Incubations of [14C]arachidonic acid [( 14C]AA) with cell-free preparations from normal, clinically involved and uninvolved epidermis from psoriatic subjects resulted in the formation of several radiolabeled metabolites of the lipoxygenase pathway. The identities of the monohydroxy-ETEs and dihydroxy-ETEs (products of the 12-lipoxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase pathways) were determined by comparison with authentic standards of 12L-hydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicotetraenoic acid (12-HETE) and authentic 5S,12R-dihydroxy-6,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (LTB4) by thin-layer chromatography in two solvent systems; by silicic acid column chromatography and by normal phase and straight phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Activity of the enzymes which catalyze this transformation are localized in the soluble (105,000 g supernatant) fraction of the epidermal preparations. The activity of enzymes of both pathways were inhibited by 5,8,11,13-eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA) and nor-dihydroguaretic acid (NDGA), known inhibitors of the lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase pathways. Transformation of [14C]AA into [14C]LTB4-like metabolite by the soluble preparations from clinically involved psoriatic epidermis was significantly higher (p less than 0.001) than from paired uninvolved soluble preparations or from soluble preparations from normal subjects. Furthermore, biosynthesis of LTB4-like metabolite by the uninvolved soluble preparation was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) than preparations from normal epidermis. These results imply that the [14C]LTB4-like metabolite biosynthesized by the clinically involved soluble preparation was due at least in part to the increased activity of the lesional enzymes and not entirely due to possible intraepidermal infiltrating neutrophils. Human epidermal preparations, therefore, contain enzymes which catalzye the transformation of labeled AA into labeled LTB4-like metabolite as well as into other yet unidentified dihydroxy-ETEs. Localization of a soluble 5-lipoxygenase-like activity in the epidermis implies a possible role of the lipoxygenase products in the proliferative and inflammatory processes in this tissue."
7192421	"From September 1990 to January 1992, 545 liver transplant patients were randomised to treatment with either FK506 and prednisolone or a conventional cyclosporin-based immunosuppressive regimen (CBIR). Eight European centres participated in the study. Adverse events were reported as defined by each centre. Hyperglycaemia was reported as an adverse event in 30.7% of patients receiving FK 506 compared with 20.5% in the CBIR group (P <    0.01). Diabetes mellitus was reported in 17.2% of patients treated with FK 506 and 9.5% of CBIR-treated patients (P <    0.05). Treatment with insulin was required in 12.0% of patients in the DK 506 treatment group and in 5% in the CBIR group at 6 months. Initially, higher doses of FK 506 were used. During the study, the protocol was changed to allow a lower dose of FK 506. When the early and late cohorts of patients were compared, the incidence of diabetes mellitus fell from 23.9% to 10.5% in FK 506-treated patients but remained relatively constant in the CBIR group (10.4% to 8.7%). The median cumulative doses of i.v. and p.o. corticosteroids were significantly greater in the CBIR group. Thus, in the overall series, the incidence of diabetes mellitus was significantly greater in the FK 506 group as compared with the CBIR group. However, when a lower FK 506 dose was used during the second half of the study, the difference in the incidence of diabetes mellitus disappeared."
5903381	"Sequencing of cDNA libraries for the development of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) as well as for the discovery of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) has been a common method of developing microsatellites or SSR-based markers. In this research, our objective was to further sequence and develop common bean microsatellites from leaf and root cDNA libraries derived from the Andean gene pool accession G19833 and the Mesoamerican gene pool accession DOR364, mapping parents of a commonly used reference map. The root libraries were made from high and low phosphorus treated plants.                                                                              A total of 3,123 EST sequences from leaf and root cDNA libraries were screened and used for direct simple sequence repeat discovery. From these EST sequences we found 184 microsatellites; the majority containing tri-nucleotide motifs, many of which were GC rich (ACC, AGC and AGG in particular). Di-nucleotide motif microsatellites were about half as common as the tri-nucleotide motif microsatellites but most of these were AGn microsatellites with a moderate number of ATn microsatellites in root ESTs followed by few ACn and no GCn microsatellites. Out of the 184 new SSR loci, 120 new microsatellite markers were developed in the BMc (Bean Microsatellites from cDNAs) series and these were evaluated for their capacity to distinguish bean diversity in a germplasm panel of 18 genotypes. We developed a database with images of the microsatellites and their polymorphism information content (PIC), which averaged 0.310 for polymorphic markers.                                                                                      The present study produced information about microsatellite frequency in root and leaf tissues of two important genotypes for common bean genomics: namely G19833, the Andean genotype selected for whole genome shotgun sequencing from race Peru, and DOR364 a race Mesoamerica subgroup 2 genotype that is a small-red seeded, released variety in Central America. Both race Peru and Mesoamerica subgroup 2 (small red beans) have been understudied in comparison to race Nueva Granada and Mesoamerica subgroup 1 (black beans) both with regards to gene expression and as sources of markers. However, we found few differences between SSR type and frequency between the G19833 leaf and DOR364 root tissue-derived ESTs. Overall, our work adds to the analysis of microsatellite frequency evaluation for common bean and provides a new set of 120 BMc markers which combined with the 248 previously developed BMc markers brings the total in this series to 368 markers. Once we include BMd markers, which are derived from GenBank sequences, the current total of gene-based markers from our laboratory surpasses 500 markers. These markers are basic for studies of the transcriptome of common bean and can form anchor points for genetic mapping studies in the future."
7604176	"Domino liver transplantation (DLT) has been developed as a method to expand the donor pool. In living donors DLT, the prime concern is to avoid any disadvantage to the donor and the first recipient. Seven DLTs were performed among 211 patients who underwent living donor liver transplantation. The domino recipients included six with hepatocellular carcinoma and one with citrullinemia. The domino grafts were obtained from patients with familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) including the left liver in three cases and the right liver in four. Among the seven domino recipients, a 64-year-old woman with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma died of lung metastasis. The other six domino recipients are alive without FAP symptoms. In living donor liver transplantation, because the vessels of the graft from the first donor are not long enough for anastomosis, the hepatic vessels must be left as long as possible when removing the liver from the FAP patients in order to ensure sufficient safety for vascular reconstruction. With careful decision making during the procedure, such as where to divide the vessels in the FAP patients, DLT may help address the shortage of liver grafts."

Today, these issues are more significant as women have delayed childbearing into their 30's and 40's, and the likelihood of diagnosis with melanoma during pregnancy is enhanced. More recent clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory studies have shed some light on the relationship among hormones, nevi, and melanoma in pregnancy."
4924361	"Lipid peroxidation due to oxygen free radicals (OFR) seems to play a major role in loss of liver graft viability after warm ischemia, preservation, and transplantation. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an antioxidant that has a direct effect on OFR, and is also a glutathione precursor, another antioxidant. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of NAC in preventing ischemia-reperfusion damage of liver grafts harvested from non-heart-beating donors. Liver transplantation was performed on pigs divided into five groups: group 1 (control group; n=5) received livers from heart-beating donors; livers were subjected to 30 min of warm ischemia in groups 2 (n=3, no NAC) and group 3 (n=3; NAC treatment); warm ischemia time lasted 60 min in groups 4 (n=4; no NAC) and 5 (n=5; NAC treatment). Studied parameters included graft survival for more than 3 days, aspartate aminotransferase plasma levels, liver histology, and hepatic total glutathione concentrations. Graft survival was 100% in groups 1, 2, and 3, 0% in group 4, and 20% in group 5. NAC treatment did not influence initial mean aspartate aminotransferase release which was greater in warm ischemic livers than in controls. NAC treatment had no effect on liver hepatic total glutathione after reperfusion of animals receiving warm ischemic grants. Finally, no effect on liver histology was observed with NAC treatment. Our study suggests that in liver transplantation from non-heart-beating donors, NAC has no effect in both graft viability and lipid peroxidation. The role of OFR in primary dysfunction of transplanted warm ischemic livers remains controversial."
3464467	"Control of apoptosis via death ligands plays a basic role for lymphocyte homeostasis and lymphoma development. In this study, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) cell lines revealed pronounced resistance to death ligands as compared to cell lines of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). The proapoptotic activity of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha was blocked, sensitivity to TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand was significantly reduced, and 1/4 CTCL cell lines was resistant to CD95 activation. In parallel, there was no activation of effector caspase-3 and initiator caspase-8 in nonresponsive CTCL cells, whereas caspase-10 was cleaved selectively in sensitive CTCL cells. No indication for a responsibility of typical downstream regulators of apoptosis was obtained, but loss of CD95 was found in 1/4, loss of TNF-R1 in 3/4, loss of caspase-10 in 2/4, loss of Bid in 1/4, and overexpression of cellular flice inhibitory protein was found in 4/4 CTCL cell lines. This clearly indicates an inhibition of apoptosis early in the extrinsic cascade, namely at the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex. Parallels with regard to expression of apoptosis regulators were seen in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and biopsies of CTCL patients. This study may indicate defects in apoptosis in CTCL and may help to guide CTCL therapy."

3420599	"Fatigue is a prevalent and substantial phenomenon in many patients with chronic inflammatory diseases, often rated by patients as the most troublesome symptom and aspect of their disease. It frequently interferes with physical and social functions and may lead to social withdrawal, long-standing sick leave and disability. Although psychological and somatic factors such as depression, sleep disorders, pain and anaemia influence fatigue, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms by which fatigue is generated and regulated are largely unknown. Increasing evidence points towards a genetic and molecular basis for fatigue as part of the innate immune system and cellular stress responses. Few studies have focused on fatigue in dermatological diseases. Most of these studies describe fatigue as a phenomenon related to psoriatic arthritis and describe the beneficial effects of biological agents on fatigue observed in clinical studies. It is therefore possible that this problem has been underestimated and deserves more attention in the dermatological community. In this review, we provide a definition and explanation for chronic fatigue, describe some commonly used instruments for measuring fatigue, and present hypothetical biological mechanisms with an emphasis on activation of the innate immune system and oxidative stress. An overview of relevant clinical studies covering the theme 'psoriasis and fatigue' is given."

Rapid differentiation and mineralization of osteoblast cultures grown on titanium alloy surfaces was observed. The successful short-term culture of mineralizing mandibular osteoblasts on titanium alloy surfaces occurred without the formation of a tenacious adhesive interface between the alloplastic material and the multilayered cell culture."
5462368	"Non-melanoma skin cancer is the most frequently occurring type of cancer worldwide and is caused by epidermal carcinogenesis and malignant progression that involve dysregulated expression of proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. The proto-oncogene pituitary tumor-transforming gene 1 (PTTG1) is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor that can promote enhanced proliferation of cultured epidermal keratinocytes. To investigate the potential roles of PTTG1 in epidermal carcinogenesis and malignant progression, the expression of PTTG1 was analysed by immunohistochemistry along with Ki67, keratin 10 (K10) and p53 in tissue samples of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), actinic keratoses (AK) and Bowen's disease (BD). Expression levels of PTTG1 were compared among these disease groups to test for correlations with proliferation, differentiation capacity or the existence of mutated tumor suppressor genes in each disease group. In each disease group, the expression levels of PTTG1 correlated positively with those of Ki67, although the differentiation status, measured by K10 expression, did not show any correlation. In contrast, the existence of mutated p53 proteins showed a positive correlation only in the SCC group. Moreover, the expression levels of PTTG1 in SCC did not correlate with known prognostic factors such as TNM staging or tumor thickness. These results suggest that PTTG1 may represent a proliferation marker associated with mutated p53 proteins but is not an informative predictor of poor clinical outcomes in SCC."
3775210	"The poor prognosis of stage IIIb melanoma (5-year survival: 36%) shows the need for effective adjuvant therapy to prolong disease-free survival.                                                                                  The feasibility and efficacy of interferon alfa-2b (IFN-alpha) therapy in stage IIIb melanoma patients was investigated.                                                                              alpha-IFN was given at a dose of 3 MU i.m. three times a week to 50 patients. Clinical and immunological controls were carried out.                                                                              The median follow-up was 43 months (range 5-84). Median survival was 43 months and median disease-free survival 39 months. Overall 5-year survival (62%) was higher than that reported in the literature to date. A significant increase of circulating CD56+ and DR+ lymphocytes after therapy was more evident in disease-free patients than in those with progressing disease.                                                                                      Adjuvant IFN-alpha therapy in stage IIIb melanoma patients is well tolerated and seems to increase survival. However, multicenter randomized trials are needed to confirm these preliminary findings."

7783332	"Keloid is a dermal fibroproliferative lesion of unknown etiology that commonly recurs after surgical excision. Post-operative adjuvant electron beam (EB) irradiation has been successfully used to reduce keloid recurrences. To provide new insights into the molecular mechanism behind the effect of EB irradiation, we used a cDNA microarray screening of more than 5000 genes to assess early changes in gene expression between EB-irradiated and non-irradiated keloid and non-lesional dermal fibroblasts. Primary fibroblast cultures from keloid and associated non-lesional dermis obtained from five patients were exposed to 15 Gy EB irradiation and analyzed after 15 min incubation. Early response to EB irradiation showed that 96 (1.8%) genes were modulated 2-fold or more in keloid fibroblasts. Upregulated genes accounted for 29.2% (28 genes), whereas downregulated genes comprised 70.8% (68 genes), indicating a silencing of many genes in keloid fibroblasts after EB irradiation. Many of the downregulated genes play roles in the enhancement of cell proliferation and extracellular matrix production, whereas several of the upregulated genes involves in the promotion of apoptosis and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. Using emerging bioinformatic tools and further corroboration, the interleukin 6 (IL-6) signaling pathway was found to be mainly involved in EB irradiation response. We also showed co-expression of IL-6 and its specific receptor (IL-6Ralpha) in keloid fibroblasts that points to the existence of an IL-6 autocrine loop in these cells. These results suggested that at the molecular level, EB irradiation might hinder keloid formation by regularizing disturbances in the homeostatic equilibrium between inducer and inhibitor activities in the matrix system most likely through the IL-6 pathway. Our study provides clues for the molecular mechanism(s) behind the beneficial effect of EB irradiation in reducing keloid recurrences and may help develop alternative strategies for the therapy and prophylaxis of this lesion."
6919818	"To assess the long-term risk of developing cancer among heart transplant recipients compared to the Canadian general population, we carried out a retrospective cohort study of 1703 patients who received a heart transplant between 1981 and 1998, identified from the Canadian Organ Replacement Register database. Vital status and cancer incidence were determined through record linkage to the Canadian Mortality Database and Canadian Cancer Registry. Cancer incidence rates among heart transplant patients were compared to those of the general population. The observed number of incident cancers was 160 with 58.9 expected in the general population (SIR = 2.7, 95% CI = 2.3, 3.2). The highest ratios were for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (SIR = 22.7, 95% CI = 17.3, 29.3), oral cancer (SIR = 4.3, 95% CI = 2.1, 8.0) and lung cancer (SIR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.2, 3.0). Compared to the general population, SIRs for NHL were particularly elevated in the first year posttransplant during more recent calendar periods, and among younger patients. Within the heart transplant cohort, overall cancer risks increased with age, and the 15-year cumulative incidence of all cancers was estimated to be 17%. There is an excess of incident cases of cancer among heart transplant recipients. The relative excesses are most marked for NHL, oral and lung cancer."
1358498	"With the increasing adoption of steroid-sparing immunosuppression protocols in renal transplantation, it is important to evaluate any adverse effects of steroid avoidance on graft function. Early graft function, measured by CrCl was retrospectively studied in 158 consecutive pediatric renal transplant recipients from 1996 to 2005, receiving either steroid-free or steroid-based immunosuppression. Patients receiving steroid-free immunosuppression vs. steroid-based immunosuppression had no difference change in CrCl (DeltaCrCl) in the first week post-transplantation (p = 0.12). When stratified by corticosteroid usage, patients with higher tacrolimus trough levels (>    or =14 ng/mL) had slower graft function recovery in the first week post-transplantation than those with lower tacrolimus trough levels (p = 0.008) in the steroid-free group only. Despite initial slower graft function recovery in this subgroup, there was no negative impact on graft function in the steroid-free group; in fact steroid-free patients trended towards better CrCl at six months (p = 0.047) and 12 months (p <    0.001) post-transplant than the steroid-based group. With the improved immunological outcomes with steroid avoidance, close surveillance should be performed of tacrolimus levels to avoid levels >   14 ng/mL. In patients with slow recovery of early graft function, short-term perioperative steroids may be considered."
6857618	"Guided bone regeneration (GBR) is a commonly utilized surgical technique in the craniofacial region. The transcriptional mechanisms associated with this type of bone regeneration are not well understood. The aim of this study was to characterize the transcriptome associated with GBR of a critical-size calvarial defect in the rat.                                                                                           Critical-size calvarial defects were created in six Wistar strain rats and treated according to the principles of GBR. The tissue filling the regenerating defect was harvested at 7 and 14 days. Total RNA was extracted and microarray analysis was carried out to identify the differences in the transcriptome between days 7 and 14.                                                                              Gene ontology (GO) analysis of the genes up-regulated at day 7 showed that immature wound healing-related mechanisms, such as protein metabolism and cell proliferation, were up-regulated at this time point. Furthermore, the immuno-inflammatory process was also up-regulated at the earlier time point. In contrast, by day 14, GO groups consistent with wound maturation, such as extracellular matrix formation, anatomical structure development and cell differentiation, were up-regulated. Furthermore, the functionally important GO categories of skeletal development, ossification and bone mineralization were up-regulated at day 14. Genes of interest that belonged to this group and were up-regulated at day 14 included growth and differentiation factors (Bmp2, Bmp3, Tgfb3), extracellular matrix proteins (osteocalcin, osteomodulin, stenniocalcin 1) and transcription factors (Runx2, Sox6, Satb2). Furthermore, a number of genes associated with Tgfβ/Bmp and Wnt signalling were also up-regulated. Besides skeletogenesis, genes associated with angiogenesis and neurogenesis were also up-regulated at day 14.                                                                                      The transcriptome associated with a maturing GBR-treated craniofacial bone defect is characterized by the down-regulation of the immuno-inflammatory response and up-regulation of skeletogeneis-, angiogenesis- and neurogenesis-associated genes. The Tgfβ/Bmp and Wnt signalling pathways play an important role in the regenerative process."
3374571	"A transient expression system based on a deleted version of Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) RNA-2, termed CPMV-HT, in which the sequence to be expressed is positioned between a modified 5' UTR and the 3' UTR has been successfully used for the plant-based expression of a wide range of proteins, including heteromultimeric complexes. While previous work has demonstrated that alterations to the sequence of the 5' UTR can dramatically influence expression levels, the role of the 3' UTR in enhancing expression has not been determined. In this work, we have examined the effect of different mutations in the 3'UTR of CPMV RNA-2 on expression levels using the reporter protein GFP encoded by the expression vector, pEAQexpress-HT-GFP. The results showed that the presence of a 3' UTR in the CPMV-HT system is important for achieving maximal expression levels. Removal of the entire 3' UTR reduced expression to approximately 30% of that obtained in its presence. It was found that the Y-shaped secondary structure formed by nucleotides 125-165 of the 3' UTR plays a key role in its function; mutations that disrupt this Y-shaped structure have an effect equivalent to the deletion of the entire 3' UTR. Our results suggest that the Y-shaped secondary structure acts by enhancing mRNA accumulation rather than by having a direct effect on RNA translation. The work described in this paper shows that the 5' and 3' UTRs in CPMV-HT act orthogonally and that mutations introduced into them allow fine modulation of protein expression levels."
2140399	"The implant failure rate in temporal bone has been reported to be about 5 to 10% over a 10-year period. A number of our elderly patients have shown increased failure rates over a long time period, which is the reason for the present study.                                                                                The aim of the present study was to find out if age is correlated with implant failure and to measure blood flow in implant sites.                                                                                            The long-time survival of 131 osseointegrated implants installed in the temporal bones of 81 patients was correlated with the age of the patient at the time of installation. The blood flow in 37 fixture installation sites in 22 patients was recorded by means of laser Doppler flowmetry.                                                                              The mean implant failure rate in the study group was 9.8% after a mean follow-up time of 7.6 years. There was a significant increase of implant failure in patients above 60 years of age. There was further a trend that implants used for the bone-anchored hearing aid were lost to a higher proportion than implants used for bone-anchored episthesis. There was also a trend that female patients lost fewer implants than males. Blood flow in the temporal bone correlated well with the age of the patient in that the highest values were recorded from the youngest patients.                                                                                      Increasing age affects failures of osseointegrated implants in the temporal bone. Blood flow is higher in the child's temporal bone, a factor that can be of importance to understand why age influences implant survival."
9094664	"In this study, we examined desmoglein (Dsg) 3 and other desmosomal molecules after pemphigus vulgaris (PV)-immunoglobulin G (IgG) binding to the Dsg3 on the cell surface in DJM-1 cells, a human squamous cell carcinoma cell line. After cells were incubated with PV-IgG for various time periods (0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 60 min, or 30 h), cells were fractionated into phosphate-buffered saline soluble (cytosol), phosphate-buffered saline insoluble-Triton X-100 soluble (membrane), and Triton X-100 insoluble (cytoskeleton) fractions, and subjected to immunoblotting and immunofluorescence microscopy using antibodies against Dsgl, Dsg3, plakoglobin, desmoplakin 1, and cytokeratins. Immunoblot analysis with PV-IgG revealed that Dsg3 was already dramatically depleted from the membrane fraction 20 min after PV-IgG treatment, whereas no reduction of Dsg3 was detected in the cytoskeleton fraction as examined by immunoblotting. A 30 h incubation with PV-IgG, however, caused a marked disappearance of Dsg3, but not other desmosomal molecules, from cytoskeleton fractions. Furthermore, double-staining immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that Dsg3 was depleted from the desmosomes whereas Dsg1, desmoplakin 1, plakoglobin, and keratin filaments were bound to desmosomes. These results provide a novel interpretation for a better understanding of mechanisms for blistering in PV; i.e., a possibility that PV-IgG generates the formation of aberrant desmosomes, which are lacking in Dsg3, but not other desmosomal constituents."
7510637	"There is a constant need to define the epidemiological and mycological characteristics of onychomycosis (OM) for optimal management strategies.                                                                                   To define the epidemiological and mycological characteristics of patients with dermatophyte toenail OM in a tertiary care hospital.                                                                                            Hundred consecutive patients of KOH and culture-positive dermatophyte toenail OM were subjected to detailed history, clinical examination and investigations.                                                                              Maximum number of patients (40%) belonged to 31-45 years age group and there was a male preponderance (M:F = 6.7:1). The mean duration of disease was 54 months. Thirty-three patients had fingernail involvement in addition to the toenail OM and 37% had co-existent cutaneous dermatophyte infection. Discoloration was the most common symptom (98%). Ninety-four (94%) patients had distal lateral subungual onychomycosis (DSLO) while two had superficial onychomycosis (SO) and only one had proximal superficial onychomycosis (PSO). Trichophyton interdigitale was the most common etiological agent (61%) followed by Trichophyton rubrum and Trichophyton verrucosum.                                                                                      Toenail OM is more common in males. DSLO was the most common clinical variant and T. interdigitale the most common etiological fungus responsible for toenail OM in our region. The importance of early diagnosis and treatment is highlighted as long-standing toenail OM predisposes to fingernail onychomycosis and recurrent tinea pedis."
7701010	"Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is secreted under stress and regulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. However, CRH is also secreted outside the brain where it exerts proinflammatory effects through activation of mast cells, which are increasingly implicated in immunity and inflammation. Substance P (SP) is also involved in inflammatory diseases. Human LAD2 leukemic mast cells express only CRHR-1 mRNA weakly. Treatment of LAD2 cells with SP (0.5-2 μM) for 6 hours significantly increases corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor-1 (CRHR-1) mRNA and protein expression. Addition of CRH (1 μM) to LAD2 cells, which are ""primed"" with SP for 48 hours and then washed, induces synthesis and release of IL-8, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 24 hours later. These effects are blocked by pretreatment with an NK-1 receptor antagonist. Treatment of LAD2 cells with CRH (1 μM) for 6 hours induces gene expression of NK-1 as compared with controls. However, repeated stimulation of mast cells with CRH (1 μM) leads to downregulation of CRHR-1 and upregulation in NK-1 gene expression. These results indicate that SP can stimulate mast cells and also increase expression of functional CRHR-1, whereas CRH induces NK-1 gene expression. These results may explain CRHR-1 and NK-1 expression in lesional skin of psoriatic patients."
5828129	"The search for a cereal promoter capable of driving preferential transgene expression in the pericarp epidermis (epicarp) of developing barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) resulted in the cloning of a novel gene. This encoded a polypeptide of 124 amino acids showing 87 identity with WBP1A, a wheat lipid transfer protein (LTP), but much lower homology to other barley LTPs. In addition to the epicarp, this Ltp-like gene, Ltp6, is highly expressed in coleoptiles and embryos under normal growth conditions. Messenger RNA levels increased in seedling tissues during salt and cold treatments and under applied abscisic acid (ABA) and salicylic acid (SA). Taken together, Ltp6 tissue-specific and response patterns are distinct from other known barley Ltp genes. Inverse PCR was used to derive 2345 bp of upstream Ltp6 sequence. The level of transcription conferred by different promoter deletion constructs was assessed by quantitative real time RT-PCR using gfp as a reporter in transient expression assays. All constructs containing at least 192 bp of upstream sequence and the 5'UTR conferred tissue-specific expression and retained most of the promoter strength. Deletion of 64 bp (-192/-128) from this upstream sequence reduced expression levels by 80. Moreover, a minimal 247 bp Ltp6 promoter continuously drove gfp expression during spike development, from early ovary differentiation through its final expression in the epicarp and during embryogenesis and germination in transgenic barley, reproducing the expression pattern of the native gene. The potential use of this promoter sequence for targeting transgene-mediated disease resistance in barley and wheat is discussed."

Less commonly, it may have extragenital involvement in 15 to 20% of cases. Lichen sclerosus has been reported at sites of injury as a Koebner phenomenon. We report a case of lichen sclerosus at the site of a tattoo with simultaneous genital involvement."
2782903	"Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) has been well documented in prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes, but its role in plants and animals remains elusive. In a recent study, we showed that at least 57 families of nuclear genes in the moss Physcomitrella patens were acquired from prokaryotes, fungi or viruses and that HGT played a critical role in plant colonization of land. In this paper, we categorize all acquired genes based on their putative functions and biological processes, and further address the importance of HGT in plant innovation and evolution."
3010999	"Prostaglandins can affect the vascular response and are locally produced in the peritoneal cavity. Prostaglandin inhibition in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients during peritonitis using indomethacin intraperitoneally was found to decrease the intrinsic permeability to macromolecules.                                                                              In the present study the effects of prostaglandin inhibition were studied during stable, uninfected CAPD. Two standard peritoneal permeability analyses (1.36% glucose) were performed in 10 stable CAPD patients within 1 week with and without addition of 12.5 mg/l indomethacin. Furthermore, possible effects on the parameters of nitric oxide synthesis were determined. In five other patients a high dose of indomethacin was tested. The night before the indomethacin test, 12.5 mg/l indomethacin was added to the nightdwell and the test was performed with 25 mg/l indomethacin.                                                                              In the normal dose indomethacin group, the dialysate concentrations of prostaglandin (PG) 6-keto-PGF1alpha and thromboxane (Tx) TxB2 were significantly lower with indomethacin (IND) compared with the control dwell (C): 6-keto-PGF1alpha median 93 (C) vs 7.5 (IND) ng/l, P=0.006 and TxB2 12.3 (C) vs 9.0 (IND) ng/l, P=0.04. The dialysate concentration of PGE2 was not different during the control dwell (68.5 ng/l) compared with the indomethacin experiment (50.3 ng/l, P=0.5). The mass transfer area coefficients (MTAC) of nitrate and cGMP, and parameters of nitric oxide synthesis, were similar during both experiments. The MTAC of creatinine and urate were not different with indomethacin: creatinine median 9.5 (C) vs 10.2 ml/min (IND), P=0.2 and urate 7.2 (C) vs 7.3 ml/min (IND), P=0.3. Only the MTAC of urea was marginally higher with indomethacin: 16.0 (C) vs 16.6 ml/min (IND), P=0.04. No differences were found in the clearances of the macromolecules beta2-microglobulin, albumin, IgG and alpha2-microglobulin. With the high indomethacin dose no inhibition of PGE2 was found: 69 (C) vs 63 ng/l(IND), not significant. Furthermore, no differences were found in the transport rates of small solutes or proteins. This indicates no effect of indomethacin on the peritoneal surface area and the size-selective permeability to macromolecules. In both groups no effect was found on the transcapillary ultrafiltration and the effective lymphatic absorption rate during the 4-h dwell. Consequently, the net ultrafiltration, the difference between these, did not change.                                                                                      The indomethacin induced inhibition of the synthesis of 6-keto-PGF1alpha and TxB2 did not lead to alterations in functional parameters of the peritoneal surface area, the intrinsic permeability to macromolecules and fluid kinetics. Therefore, these prostaglandins are not likely to be involved in the regulation of peritoneal transport during stable CAPD."
6488255	"Measurement of sirolimus in blood as a guide to dose adjustment is an accepted practice. To date, most data have resulted from the use of a chromatographic technique. With the imminent introduction of an immunoassay into this field, there is a need to know whether metabolites that could interfere with the performance of this assay, causing a bias compared with measurements made by a chromatographic assay, vary over a period of time or with changes in concomitant immunosuppressive therapy. This preliminary study measured several sirolimus metabolites in blood samples from a variety of clinical settings, using high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass-spectrometric detection. Two metabolites known to cross-react in one immunoassay system, single hydroxylation products and 41-O-demethyl rapamycin, were found to constitute the bulk of the metabolic products. They were also found to form a remarkably stable proportion of all metabolites measured, both with respect to the time since transplantation and the concomitant use of cyclosporine or tacrolimus. It is concluded that the analytical bias due to cross-reactivity with metabolites, inherent in this immunoassay, should be consistent across a wide spectrum of patients receiving the drug."
1465555	"The Arctic population of the kelp Saccharina latissima differs from the Helgoland population in its sensitivity to changing temperature and CO      2       levels. The Arctic population does more likely benefit from the upcoming environmental scenario than its Atlantic counterpart. The previous research demonstrated that warming and ocean acidification (OA) affect the biochemical composition of Arctic (Spitsbergen; SP) and cold-temperate (Helgoland; HL) Saccharina latissima differently, suggesting ecotypic differentiation. This study analyses the responses to different partial pressures of CO     2       (380, 800, and 1500 µatm pCO     2      ) and temperature levels (SP population: 4, 10 °C; HL population: 10, 17 °C) on the photophysiology (O     2       production, pigment composition, D1-protein content) and carbon assimilation [Rubisco content, carbon concentrating mechanisms (CCMs), growth rate] of both ecotypes. Elevated temperatures stimulated O     2       production in both populations, and also led to an increase in pigment content and a deactivation of CCMs, as indicated by      13      C isotopic discrimination of algal biomass (ε      p      ) in the HL population, which was not observed in SP thalli. In general, pCO     2       effects were less pronounced than temperature effects. High pCO     2       deactivated CCMs in both populations and produced a decrease in the Rubisco content of HL thalli, while it was unaltered in SP population. As a result, the growth rate of the Arctic ecotype increased at elevated pCO     2       and higher temperatures and it remained unchanged in the HL population. Ecotypic differentiation was revealed by a significantly higher O     2       production rate and an increase in Chl a, Rubisco, and D1 protein content in SP thalli, but a lower growth rate, in comparison to the HL population. We conclude that both populations differ in their sensitivity to changing temperatures and OA and that the Arctic population is more likely to benefit from the upcoming environmental scenario than its Atlantic counterpart."
3466203	"The life cycle of Ectocarpus siliculosus from Naples (Italy) was investigated, using well defined cultured material. Gametophytes and sporophytes differ morphologically and functionally. The gametophytes are dioecious, with genotypic determination of their sex. Sporophytes exist in the haploid, diploid and tetraploid phase. All sporophytes can form unilocular sporangia. In tetraploid and diploid sporophytes the formation of unilocular sporangia is connected with meiosis. Certain motile cells of haploid plants may spontaneously give rise to diploid or tetraploid sporophytes which are homozygous. Gametophytes can only be formed together with sporophytes form the swarmers of unilocular sporangia (heteroblasty). Meiosis in tetraploid sporophytes resulted in diploid gametophytes, the gametes of which fused with haploid female gametes. All observed nuclear phases and growth forms are connected with each other by meiosis, heteroblasty, fusion of gametes and spontaneous increase in chromosome number."
8274389	"For a long time, the mantra of acne pathogenesis debates has been that acne vulgaris lesions develop when (supposedly largely androgen-mediated) increased sebum production, ductal hypercornification, and propionibacteria come together with local inflammatory process in the unlucky affected individual. And yet, the exact sequence, precise interdependence, and choreography of pathogenic events in acne, especially the 'match that lights the fire' have remained surprisingly unclear, despite the venerable tradition of acne research over the past century. However, exciting recent progress in this--conceptually long somewhat stagnant, yet clinically, psychologically, and socioeconomically highly relevant--everyday battlefield of skin pathology encourages one to critically revisit conventional concepts of acne pathogenesis. Also, this provides a good opportunity for defining more sharply key open questions and intriguing acne characteristics whose underlying biological basis has far too long remained uninvestigated, and to emphasize promising new acne research avenues off-the-beaten-track--in the hope of promoting the corresponding development of innovative strategies for acne management."
5022372	"The traditional method to close two closely approximated cutaneous defects (i.e., a figure ""8""-shaped defect) sacrifices healthy skin and does not give optimal aesthetic results. We report a case with modified Burow's advancement flaps describing less sacrificed skin and shorter scars. Modified Burow's advancement flaps (""8""-to-""S"" plasty) were applied, sparing two Burow skin triangles. Application of that modified operation technique leads to shorter scars in comparison to traditional Burow's advancement flaps. A modified technique is presented here for skin defects shaped like an ""8""--namely, two similar round and adjoining lesions. The suture line after closing resembles an ""S"". With this 8-to-S plasty no additional incisions are necessary."
8552057	"Hereditary subtotal leuconychia is a rare nail disease. The gene(s) underlying this phenotype is (are) not known. Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies of nails are performed infrequently.                                                                                   To perform genetic linkage analysis and to assess ultrastructure and soft/hard keratin expression in hereditary white nails.                                                                              We have analysed microscopically and ultrastructurally the white nails of a patient from a family in which the trait is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner as an isolated symptom. No skin lesions or hair abnormalities could be detected. Genetic linkage studies were performed on DNA samples obtained from several members of the affected family. A longitudinal surgical biopsy of the nail from a great toe was split in two parts. One part was fixed in formalin and processed for histopathology. Another part was further subdivided and embedded either in Epon, following fixation in 2% glutaraldehyde, or in Lowicryl K4M, after fixation in 3% paraformaldehyde. Dewaxed nail sections and Lowicryl ultrathin sections were also stained with various antikeratin antibodies.                                                                              Genetic linkage studies of the family pointed to the disease gene mapping to the chromosomal 12q13 region. Genes mapping within this chromosomal region include the genes coding for type II (basic) cytokeratins and hard keratins. The nail matrix presented an abnormal hypergranulosis. The upper part of the nail plate, originating from the proximal nail matrix, had a nonhomogeneous lamellar appearance, with numerous intracellular 'lipidic' vacuoles and 'empty' spaces separating keratin filament bundles. These cells were progressively shed at the nail surface. The cell loss was compensated by hyperproliferation of the distal matrix and of the nail bed keratinocytes, with persistent marked parakeratosis and loose arrangement of keratin bundles. The distal matrix and the nail bed contributed equally to formation of the lower plate. This presented the characteristics of a tissue composed of soft keratins. Accordingly, there was virtually no labelling with the Hb1 antibody to a basic hard keratin in the white nail, whereas the labelling with AE3 antibody to all type II keratins and with KL1 recognizing suprabasal soft keratins was normal or even enhanced.                                                                                      Genetic linkage indicates that the gene defect underlying the leuconychia in the family studied resides on chromosome 12q13. As the type II keratins map within this chromosomal interval, it is possible that a mutation in one of these keratin genes may be a cause of the hereditary leuconychia. The white appearance of nails in this disease seems to be due to an abnormal keratinization of cells originating from the proximal nail matrix, leading to the presence of abundant intracellular vacuoles and to a lesser compactness of keratins."
5313075	"The aim of the present investigation was to determine the profile of peri-implant crevicular fluid (PICF) biomarkers combined with microbial profiles from implants with healthy peri-implant tissues and peri-implantitis to assess real-time disease activity.                                                                                           Sixty-eight patients were included in this cross-sectional study. They were divided into two groups: 34 patients with at least one healthy implant (control) and 34 with at least one peri-implantitis affected implant (test). Total DNA content and qPCR analysis for periodontal bacteria obtained from subgingival plaque samples (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, and Treponema denticola) and a PICF analysis for IL-1β, VEGF, MMP-8, TIMP-2, and OPG were performed. The individual and combined diagnostic ability of each biomarker for peri-implantitis and target bacterial species were analyzed.                                                                              The mean concentration of IL-1β (44.6 vs. 135.8 pg/ml; P <    0.001), TIMP-2 (5488.3 vs. 9771.8 pg/ml; P = 0.001), VEGF (59.1 vs. 129.0 pg/ml; P = 0.012), and OPG (66.5 vs. 111.7 pg/ml; P = 0.050) was increased in the peri-implantitis patients. The mean expression of MMP-8 (6029.2 vs. 5943.1 pg/ml; P = 0.454) and did not reveal a meaningful difference among groups. Total bacterial DNA of selected microorganisms was associated with a threefold or greater increase in peri-implantitis although no statistical significant difference. The ability to diagnose diseased sites was enhanced by T. denticola combined with IL-1β, VEGF, and TIMP-2 PICF levels.                                                                                     The present data suggest that the increased levels of the selected PICF-derived biomarkers of periodontal tissue inflammation, matrix degradation/regulation, and alveolar bone turnover/resorption combined with site-specific microbial profiles may be associated with peri-implantitis and could have potential as predictors of peri-implant diseases."
2874337	"The aim of this study was to determine whether CNIs can be safely withdrawn in paediatric patients with declining renal allograft function receiving MMF and corticosteroids for long-term immunosuppression following renal transplantation. We performed a retrospective review of paediatric renal transplant recipients who received MMF with corticosteroids at least three months after transplantation with or without CNI in a single centre. Thirty-eight children (71% male), mean age 7.2 +/- 3.7 yr received MMF and corticosteroids, with 29 (76%) receiving a CNI. Mean follow-up was 59.2 +/- 42 months post-MMF commencement and 109 +/- 98.8 months post-transplantation. Patient and renal allograft survival were 100% and 94%, respectively. There was a significant improvement in eGFR after MMF introduction both in children on a CNI and those where the CNI was withdrawn, with stabilisation of eGFR after two yr. There was no significant difference in the number of acute rejection episodes prior to or following introduction of MMF between the groups. MMF in combination with corticosteroids is a safe and effective immunosuppressive regimen in paediatric renal transplantation. Complete withdrawal of CNIs after conversion to MMF should be considered in all patients, to preserve renal function as evidenced by improved eGFR."
7767924	Erythema elevatum diutinum (EED) is a rare skin disease that initially presents as leucocytoclastic vasculitis and later resolves with fibrosis. Dermatitis herpetiformis is an autoimmune blistering disease characterized by granular deposits of immunoglobulin A (IgA) in dermal papillae. We report a rare association of these two disorders.
9604715	"The primary objective of this study was to determine the association between the size of the void established by using two different implant configurations and the amount of buccal/palatal bone loss that occurred during 16 weeks of healing following their installation into extraction sockets.                                                                                           The clinical trial was designed as a prospective, randomized-controlled parallel-group multicenter study. Adults in need of one or more implants replacing teeth to be removed in the maxilla within the region 15-25 were recruited. Following tooth extraction, the site was randomly allocated to receive either a cylindrical (group A) or a tapered implant (group B). After implant installation, a series of measurements were made to determine the dimension of the ridge and the void between the implant and the extraction socket. These measurements were repeated at the re-entry procedure after 16 weeks.                                                                              The study demonstrated that the removal of single teeth and the immediate placement of an implant resulted in marked alterations of the dimension of the buccal ridge (43% and 30%) and the horizontal (80-63%) as well as the vertical (69-65%) gap between the implant and the bone walls. Although the dimensional changes were not significantly different between the two-implant configurations, both the horizontal and the vertical gap changes were greater in group A than in group B.                                                                                      Implant placement into extraction sockets will result in significant bone reduction of the alveolar ridge."

To investigate the effects of aerobic exercise on arterial function, oxidative stress, lipid profile, and sympathetic nervous system activity, 20 heart transplant recipients (age, 54.3 +/- 9.1 years; 17 men, 3 women) were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of supervised treadmill exercise (Trained; n = 10) or standard medical care (Control; n = 10). Supervised exercise was initiated at 8 weeks after transplant. Brachial artery reactivity was assessed using flow-mediated dilation.                                                                              The VO2 peak increased 26% in the Trained patients (15.4 +/- 4.3 vs 19.4 +/- 5.5 ml/kg/min; p <    or = 0.05) but did not change in the Controls (16.2 +/- 5.2 vs 16.8 +/- 2.8 ml/kg/min; p >    or = 0.05). Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (10.1% +/- 6.1% vs 9.6% +/- 6.2%) and absolute brachial diameter (0.48 +/- 0.22 vs 0.42 +/- 0.24 mm) did not change in Trained patients, but brachial flow-mediated dilation (10.5% +/- 2.8% vs 7.9% +/- 5.1%) and the absolute change in brachial diameter (0.48 +/- 0.16 vs 0.36 +/- 0.24 mm) decreased significantly (p <    or = 0.05) in the Control patients. Resting norepinephrine decreased significantly (p <    or = 0.05) after training (0.32 +/- 0.19 vs 0.22 +/- 0.22 ng/ml), but there was a nonsignificant trend toward increased norepinephrine in the Controls (0.26 +/- 0.17 vs 0.53 +/- 0.41 ng/ml; p = 0.07). The lipid profile and marker of oxidative stress did not differ between the groups before or after the intervention.                                                                                      To our knowledge, this is the first prospective, randomized study to investigate the effects of heart transplantation and aerobic exercise on peripheral artery function in the same cohort of heart transplant recipients. Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation increased early in the post-operative period. Aerobic exercise preserved but did not improve brachial artery flow-mediated dilation. Heart transplant recipients who did not participate in supervised exercise showed a progressive decline in brachial artery flow-mediated dilation."
5082026	"Nitric oxide (NO) has several important roles in various physiological settings; one of the NO synthases, inducible NO synthase (iNOS), is induced by external stimulation of the skin. A prototypic example of external stimulation is hapten exposure, which induces the T-cell-mediated immune response known as contact hypersensitivity (CHS). We herein report on cutaneous dendritic cell (DC) function in the presence of an iNOS-specific inhibitor during the sensitization phase of CHS. First, we examined epidermal cell (EC) suspensions using flow cytometry with an iNOS antibody and confirmed that iNOS was expressed in the cytoplasm of Langerhans cells (LCs). We then studied the role of iNOS in CHS, and found that responses to DNFB were enhanced by the addition of an iNOS inhibitor during sensitization. Similarly, the iNOS inhibitor augmented FITC-induced migration of cutaneous DCs, including Langerin(+) LCs and Langerin(-) dermal DCs, to draining lymph nodes. Finally, we showed that iNOS inhibitor enhanced LC survival in vitro. We concluded that NO suppresses migration and survival of cutaneous DCs, resulting in a downmodulation of CHS."
2474950	"Amphicarpy is a fascinating reproductive strategy, defined as fruit produced both below the soil surface and as aerial fruit on the same plant. Trifolium polymorphum is a grassland species subject to herbivory that combines amphicarpy with vegetative reproduction through stolons. Underground flowers have been described as obligate autogamous and aerial ones as self-compatible allogamous, with aerial floral traits favouring cross-pollination. In the present work we performed different pollination treatments on aerial flowers to analyse rates of pollen tube development and offspring fitness, measured as fruit set, seed production and germination percentage. This last variable was compared to that of seeds produced underground. No significant differences were found between fruit set in self- and cross-pollinations. Seed production was higher in self-pollinations, which is consistent with the higher rate of pollen tube development observed in self-crosses. Spontaneous self-pollination is limited in aerial flowers; thus pollen transfer by means of a vector is required even within the same flower. Germination tests showed that aerial seeds produced after self- and cross-pollination did not differ in fitness, but underground seeds had higher germination percentage than aerial ones. Thus, we conclude that T. polymorphum has a mixed mating system. In grasslands with heavy grazing pressure, clonal propagation and underground seed production ensure persistence in the field. An intermediate level of selfing in aerial flowers ensures offspring, but morphological (herkogamy) and functional (dicogamy) floral traits maintain a window to incorporate genetic variability, allowing the species to tolerate temporal and spatial pressures."
9274094	"Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations and a variable course. In numerous investigations, it has been shown that exogenous factors, such as UV-light and drugs, can induce this disease. However, not all clinical aspects can be explained and therefore, the pathogenesis of CLE is currently under extensive research. The various cutaneous manifestations of LE are divided into LE-nonspecific and LE-specific skin disease based on histologic criteria. LE-nonspecific manifestations are mostly associated with systemic LE but can also occur in other diseases and include particularly vascular skin lesions such as pe-riungual telangiectases. LE-specific skin disease includes the subtypes of CLE such as acute cutaneous LE (ACLE), subacute cutaneous LE (SCLE), chronic cutaneous LE (CCLE), and intermittent CLE (ICLE). The subdivision of these subtypes with different prognosis and course is supported by genetic, clinical, histologic, and immunoserologic findings. The subtypes of CLE require a specific morphological and clinical analysis, which is described in the first part of this review. In the second part of this review, further diagnostic procedures and therapeutic strategies in patients with CLE are discussed."
3292443	"Chloroplasts are descendants of cyanobacteria and divide by binary fission. The number of chloroplasts is regulated in a cell type-specific manner to ensure that specialized cell types can perform their functions optimally. Several protein components of the chloroplast division apparatus have been identified in the past several years, but how this process is regulated in response to developmental status, environmental signals and stress is still unknown. To begin to address this we undertook a proteomic analysis of three accumulation and replication of chloroplasts mutants that show a spectrum of plastid division perturbations. We show that defects in the chloroplast division process results in changes in the abundance of proteins when compared to wild type, but that the profile of the native stromal and membrane complexes remains unchanged. Furthermore, by combining BN-PAGE with protein interaction assays we show that AtFtsZ2-1 and AtFtsZ2-2 assemble together with rpl12A and EF-Tu into a novel chloroplast membrane complex."
1570137	"A 29-year-old man was admitted to our department with renal failure secondary to glomerulonephritis. No history of deep venous thromboses was reported, and no iliac vessel abnormality was evident on routine ultrasound (B-mode) examination before the operation. Transplantation of his mother's left kidney revealed occlusion of his common iliac vein and distal inferior vena cava (IVC). The right spermatic cord vein was noted to be dilated and suitable for venous drainage of the allograft, which was accomplished by an end-to-side anastomosis between the renal vein and the right spermatic cord vein. The allograft showed immediate function; serum creatinine was decreased to a normal value at 5 days after surgery. After the operation, a vascular spiral computerized tomographic 3-dimensional reconstruction showed absence of the infrarenal IVC with the right spermatic cord vein draining into the end of IVC. Physical examination revealed a right-side varicocele with dilated epigastric vein. The donor kidney slower normal values upon routine follow-up at 2 years after the operation."

9123021	"Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are increasingly recognized as playing a major role in nondeletional tolerance. To avoid rejection before tolerance is established, clinical trials of tolerance induction include immunosuppressive drugs early posttransplant. It is therefore essential that immunosuppressive protocols do not block Tregs generation. Tregs function has been shown to depend upon interleukin-2 signaling, but there are limited data available on how calcineurin inhibitors influence Tregs development and function in vivo.                                                                              To study this, we used a previously established rat cardiac allograft model where donor-specific Tregs and tolerance are induced by pretransplant donor-specific blood transfusion (DSBT).                                                                              In this model, we found that adjunction of 50 mg/kg cyclosporine (CsA) (not a lower dose, 10 mg/kg) at the time of DSBT (not at the time of transplantation) abrogates Tregs development and causes rejection. Interestingly, 10 mg/kg CsA given posttransplant (day 0-11) in the absence of pretransplant DSBT induced the development of Tregs and provoked a state of tolerance indistinguishable from the one induced by DSBT. Finally, DSBT given the day of transplantation did not promote tolerance, unless recipients also received a delayed short course (day 5-9) of 10 mg/kg CsA.                                                                                      Adjunction of high-dose CsA to pretransplant DSBT abrogates Tregs generation. On the contrary, a lower dose (10 mg/kg) of CsA promotes Tregs development either in synergy with perioperative DSBT (providing that a drug-free interval is respected) or by its own effect. These data provide new guidelines for a more tolerogenic use of calcineurin inhibitors in the clinic, particularly when immunomodulatory strategies aimed at inducing Tregs are applied."

2842849	"Arsenic (As) hyperaccumulation trait has been described in a limited number of fern species. The physiological basis of hyperaccumulation remains unclear, especially in non-Pteris species such as Pityrogramma calomelanos. Aiming at a better understanding of As-induced responses, P. calomelanos plants were exposed to 1 mM As for 21 days and compared with control plants. Chemical analyses revealed that As accumulation was ten times higher in pinnae then in roots and stipes. In pinnae, As was present mainly as arsenite, whereas arsenate was the dominant form in stipes and roots. Arsenic promoted an increase in antioxidant enzyme activities in both fern parts and several alterations in mineral nutrition, especially with regard to P and K. A higher content of non-protein thiols was observed in pinnae of plants exposed to As, whereas As induced the increase in lipid peroxidation in roots. The results showed that Pityrogramma calomelanos shares with Pteris vittata several aspects of As metabolism. High root-shoot As translocation showed to be essential to avoid toxic effects in roots, since the root is more sensitive to the metalloid. The higher capacity of P. calomelanos to sequester arsenite in the pinna and its efficient antioxidant system maintain the reactive oxygen species at a low level, thus enhancing the continuous accumulation of As. Molecular investigations are needed to elucidate the evolution of As-tolerance mechanisms in Pteridaceae species, especially with regard to membrane transporters and ROS signaling."

All patients were treated with sulfasalzine at initial doses of 1.5 g/day, increasing by 0.5 g/week to 3 g/day for 4-16 weeks. Some patients also received descendent doses for 2-12 months. Complete responses were observed in 13 patients and partial responses in seven patients. All patients reported an early resolution of the pruritus. No changes were detected in mucosal LP. Most of the patients tolerated the treatment well and only eight patients presented some minor side-effects.

5417960	"Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is a multifocal vascular disease with uncertain histogenesis. It is characterized by clinical and histologic polymorphism. The ""lymphangioma-like"" variant is very uncommon, accounting for less than 5% of all cases. We report the case of a 76-year-old woman, HIV negative, with a 4-year history of classic Kaposi sarcoma treated with cryotherapy who developed new bullous lesions on her lower extremities. Biopsy revealed histologic findings of lymphangioma-like KS (LLKS), together with areas of classic KS; HHV-8 staining was positive. Diagnosis of LLKS was made and the patient was proposed for radiotherapy. The lymphangioma-like Kaposi sarcoma is a rare morphologic expression of KS characterized by dilated and bizarrely shaped vascular channels lined by flattened endothelium permeating the dermis. ""Bulla-like"" lesions have been considered as a clinical hallmark of this variant. Its histologic appearance suggests a lymphatic origin of KS and it may resemble other vascular tumors. Findings of areas of typical KS and positive staining for HHV-8 may help to make a definitive diagnosis."
2349153	Atopic eczema is a common pediatric skin disorder. This review examines the use of pimecrolimus cream in the treatment of acute and chronic stages of the disease. The standard therapy is the treatment of acute flares with topical medications including pimecrolimus. The use of pimecrolimus cream for the first sign and symptoms of atopic eczema reduces the occurrence of flares as defined by the need for topical corticosteroids. The side effects of pimecrolimus cream are mild without any increase of infections or systemic immune suppression.
6583734	"This single centre study assessed the incidence, kinetics and predictive factors of EBV reactivation and EBV-related lymphoproliferative diseases (LPD) in 33 consecutive patients who received a reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) before umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT). During the first 6 months after UCBT, weekly all patients were DNA-PCR screened in the peripheral blood for EBV reactivation and were clinically monitored for clinical features attributable to EBV. The cumulative incidences of EBV reactivation (defined as an EBV load >   1000 EBV copies per 10(5) cells measured at least once during follow-up) at 6 months and 2 years after UCBT were 9 (95% confidence interval (CI), 2-22%) and 17% (95% CI, 6-33%), respectively. In 28 patients (85%), the EBV load remained negative at all times, and none of these patients experienced any sign of LPD. Five patients (15%) experienced at least one EBV reactivation episode. EBV reactivation was observed at a median of 132 days (range, 85-438) after UCBT. Two patients developed EBV-related LPD (cumulative incidence, 6% at 3 years). With a median follow-up of 468 days (range, 92-1277) post UCBT, the OS was 62% at 3 years. Five patients died of disease progression and seven patients died of transplant-related complications, including one case of EBV-related LPD. Univariate analysis did not identify any significant risk factor associated with EBV reactivation. We conclude that patients undergoing RIC UCBT are at risk for EBV reactivation, with the need for close EBV monitoring and the use of preemptive rituximab treatment as some cases may progress to life-threatening LPD."
9256434	"The epoxidation of zeaxanthin to the di-epoxide violaxanthin via the mono-epoxide antheraxanthin (called the backward-reaction), is examined with several plant objects and under various conditions.In Chlorella and in the needles of Taxus baccata a backward-conversion can be observed immediately after the termination of strong illumination. The reaction can be accelerated somewhat by exposure of the plant material to pure O2 or dim light.One cannot observe such an epoxidation in leaf disks of Spinacia oleracea under normal conditions (dark, air). It begins only under the influence of dim light or when pure oxygen is supplied. The absence of the backward-reaction under the given experimental conditions is a consequence of a closure of the stomata, which begins during the strong illumination and continues in the succeeding dark period; it is therefore a consequence of anaerobiosis in the plastid-containing cells. Yet a backward-reaction starts if the O2-tension in the cells is increased either by pure O2 given from outside or by the intracellular evolution of photosynthetic O2 (associated with a partial opening of the stomata).The concentration of the intermediate antheraxanthin increases strongly more at the beginning of the O2- or dim-light-promoted backward-reaction than the concentration of the endproduct violaxanthin. Hence it follows that during epoxidation the two O-atoms are added to the 5,6- and the 5',6'-position of the zeaxanthin not simultaneously but one after the other.In isolated chloroplasts or cell fragments no backward-reaction could be observed under various conditions tested. An apparent backward-reaction in lyophilized cells or chloroplasts, which is triggered by light or O2-atmosphere, is a result of the different velocity of the photooxidative destruction of carotenoids.The in vivo epoxidation of zeaxanthin, which probably is catalysed by a Cu-containing enzyme, only proceeds in the presence of molecular O2."
4588090	"Hospital readmission after lung transplantation negatively affects quality of life and resource utilization. A secondary analysis of data collected prospectively was conducted to identify the pattern of (incidence, count, cumulative duration), reasons for and predictors of readmission for 201 lung transplant recipients (LTRs) assessed at 2, 6, and 12 mo after discharge. The majority of LTRs (83.6%) were readmitted, and 64.2% had multiple readmissions. The median cumulative readmission duration was 19 days. The main reasons for readmission were other than infection or rejection (55.5%), infection only (25.4%), rejection only (9.9%), and infection and rejection (0.7%). LTRs who required reintubation (odds ratio [OR] 1.92; p = 0.008) or were discharged to care facilities (OR 2.78; p = 0.008) were at higher risk for readmission, with a 95.7% cumulative incidence of readmission at 12 mo. Thirty-day readmission (40.8%) was not significantly predicted by baseline characteristics. Predictors of higher readmission count were lower capacity to engage in self-care (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.99; p = 0.03) and discharge to care facilities (IRR 1.45; p = 0.01). Predictors of longer cumulative readmission duration were older age (arithmetic mean ratio [AMR] 1.02; p = 0.009), return to the intensive care unit (AMR 2.00; p = 0.01) and lower capacity to engage in self-care (AMR 0.99; p = 0.03). Identifying LTRs at risk may assist in optimizing predischarge care, discharge planning and long-term follow-up."
3520255	"With aging there is alteration of elastic properties of the skin and skin-blood flow.                                                                            The purpose of this study was to compare age-related changes in selected biomechanical parameters of the skin (skin hardness, skin extensibility, relaxation time constant, τ) and subcutaneous microcirculatory quality (SMQ) in individuals with and without venous diseases.                                                                                            TWO GROUPS WERE STUDIED: the first group was of asymptomatic healthy individuals and the second group included patients with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) and venous ulceration, without edema. Both groups were subdivided to three age categories (21-40, 41-60 and 61-90 years old). Skin hardness was measured by durometer, extensibility and τ were measured using extensometer and SQM was assessed via postural vasoconstrictive response (LDF).                                                                              Results showed that skin hardness, extensibility, and τ-values were increased, whereas LDF was decreased in the older groups as compared with younger groups. These changes are attributed to alterations in the skin structure and reduced capillaries density networks. Similar behavior was found in the biomechanical and microcirculatory changes in patients with venous ulceration and CVI, but these changes were more increased further in older patients with venous ulceration as compared with older patients with CVI and that can be attribute to more intense response against tissue injury.                                                                                      Since aging elevated skin hardness and extensibility, but lowered vasoconstrictive response in individuals, with and without, venous diseases, we conclude that aging process is likely to cause an accumulation of damaged skin tissues and that could induce an apparent antigen-driven response that altered skin structure and the subsequent biomechanical properties obtained in this study."
4667802	"The aim of this survey was to determine current practice throughout Europe regarding use and monitoring of methotrexate therapy for psoriasis. A structured questionnaire with questions on methotrexate prescribing and monitoring was mailed to 150 dermatologists in 32 European countries in June 2002. Dermatologists' names were chosen at random from the 2001 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology membership directory. A reply was received from 69 dermatologists of whom 59 prescribed methotrexate regularly. In those patients receiving systemic treatment for psoriasis, methotrexate was the most widely used drug (4.4 patients of every 10) followed by acitretin (3.2) and cyclosporin (1.6). Myelosuppression was the commonest reported fatal side-effect of methotrexate (eight of a total of 10 cases). None of the respondents routinely requested a baseline liver biopsy before starting methotrexate treatment and of every 10 of their patients on long-term methotrexate it was estimated that less than two had had a liver biopsy some time during treatment. Serum measurement of the amino-terminal peptide of type III procollagen (PIIINP) was used routinely to detect liver fibrosis by 12 (20%) of the 59 respondents who regularly prescribed methotrexate. This survey demonstrates that, despite the advent of new therapies, methotrexate retains a central role in the treatment of severe psoriasis in Europe. The responses demonstrated variation in, among others, the methotrexate dose regimen utilized and the use of folate supplementation, confirming the need for randomized controlled studies to address these issues."

4612985	"Galectin-3 is a family member of the carbohydrate-binding proteins widely expressed by many cell types and exhibits multiple cellular functions. We demonstrate that melanocytes express galectin-3, which is predominantly localized to the cell body peripherally along the Golgi zone. Downregulation of galectin-3 in human melanocytes using short hairpin RNA technology resulted in the reduction of both melanin synthesis and expression/activity of tyrosinase-related protein-1 (Tyrp-1). In the cell body, galectin-3 colocalizes with melanosome-destined cargo, specifically tyrosinase and Tyrp-1. We studied melanocytes cultured from patients with forms of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) containing defects in trafficking steps governed by biogenesis of lysosome-related organelle complex-2 (BLOC-2) (HPS-5), BLOC-3 (HPS-1), and adaptin-3 (HPS-2). We found that galectin-3 expression mimicked the defective expression of the tyrosinase cargo in dendrites of HPS-5 melanocytes, but it was not altered in HPS-1 or HPS-2 melanocytes. In addition, galectin-3 colocalized predominantly with the HPS-5 component of BLOC-2 in normal human melanocytes. These data indicate that galectin-3 is a regulatory component in melanin synthesis affecting the expression of Tyrp-1."

DNA was collected from peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNL) posttransplantation. Oligonucleotide primers for the glycoprotein B gene (149 bp) were used in a PCR ELISA assay using an internal standard for quantitation. CMV disease was defined as histological evidence of end organ damage.                                                                              The median level CMV genome equivalents in patients with CMV disease was 2665/2 x 10(5) PMNL (range 1,200 to 61,606) compared to 100 x 10(5) PMNL (range 20 to 855) with infection but no CMV disease (p = 0.036). All patients with CMV disease had genome equivalents levels of >   1200/2 x 10(5) PMNL. A cut-off level of 1,200 PMNL had a positive predictive value for CMV disease of 100% and a negative predictive value of 100%. The first detection of levels of CMV genome equivalents above a level of 1200/2 x 10(5) PMNL was at a median of 58 days (range 47 to 147) posttransplant.                                                                                      Quantitative PCR assays for the diagnosis of CMV infection may predict patients at risk of CMV disease and thereby direct preemptive treatment to high-risk patients."
9430358	"Adenosine upregulates the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblast growth factor-7 in cultured dermal papilla cells. It has been shown that, in Japanese men, adenosine improves androgenetic alopecia due to the thickening of thin hair due to hair follicle miniaturization. To investigate the efficacy and safety of adenosine treatment to improve hair loss in women, 30 Japanese women with female pattern hair loss were recruited for this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Volunteers used either 0.75% adenosine lotion or a placebo lotion topically twice daily for 12 months. Efficacy was evaluated by dermatologists and by investigators and in phototrichograms. As a result, adenosine was significantly superior to the placebo according to assessments by dermatologists and investigators and by self-assessments. Adenosine significantly increased the anagen hair growth rate and the thick hair rate. No side-effects were encountered during the trial. Adenosine improved hair loss in Japanese women by stimulating hair growth and by thickening hair shafts. Adenosine is useful for treating female pattern hair loss in women as well as androgenetic alopecia in men."
9301500	"Serration pattern analysis of direct immunofluorescence (DIF) allows the differentiation of epidermolysis bullosa acquisita from other subtypes of pemphigoid. In daily practice its use is limited due to lack of experience and unfamiliarity.                                                                                   To test the learnability of DIF serrated-pattern recognition in groups with various a priori levels of competence.                                                                              An online nversusu-test (www.nversusu.umcg.nl) was created, which contained 26 DIF images of the epidermal basement membrane zone, IgG stained and photographed with a magnification of × 40 and × 63. All images represented patients with a form of subepidermal autoimmune bullous disease. Thirteen DIF images were presented before and 13 DIF images after an instruction video about n- and u-serrated patterns. There were three options to choose from: n-serrated, u-serrated or undetermined. The test was completed by three groups of professionals: dermatology residents in training at the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG), international experts on bullous diseases, and dermatologists and pathologists who had participated in the Groningen blistering course during the past 10 years.                                                                              The overall number of correct answers of serration patterns was significantly higher after instruction than before instruction (median 9.0 correct answers vs. 11.0 correct answers, P <    0.001). Participants showed a mean improvement after instruction of 15.4% in the UMCG group (66.7% vs. 82.1%), 16.2% in the international expert group (67.2% vs. 83.4%) and 12.1% in the blistering course group (60.7% vs. 72.8%). The u-serrated pattern was better recognized than the n-serrated pattern.                                                                                      Serration pattern analysis by DIF can be learned irrespective of background of expertise."
1868616	"Psoriasis is a disease of dysregulated inflammation and epithelial hyperproliferation in the skin, involving both the innate and adaptive immune system. Psoriatic keratinocytes express high levels of psoriasin (S100A7), a small calcium-binding protein.                                                                                   To determine if patients with active psoriasis have elevated serum levels of psoriasin and psoriasin-specific autoantibodies.                                                                              Blood was collected from 14 patients with psoriasis vulgaris at the start of narrowband ultraviolet (UV) B therapy and from 11 of these patients every 2 weeks during the course of the UVB treatment. Patient and control sera were tested for psoriasin antigen levels by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and for psoriasin autoantibody titres using recombinant purified psoriasin and overlapping peptides.                                                                              We confirmed strong and specific expression of psoriasin in psoriatic epidermis by immunohistochemistry. Systemic psoriasin antigen levels tended to be lower in patients (mean 213 ng mL(-1)) than in controls (mean 331 ng mL(-1), P = 0.308) and decreased with increasing disease severity. Psoriasin-specific autoantibodies were detected in a subset of patients with psoriasis and healthy normal donors (mean 0.347 vs. 0.255 units, P = 0.246). The epitopes recognized by the autoantibodies were mapped to an external loop domain of the molecule but did not show corresponding T-cell immunogenicity.                                                                                      Although psoriasin is overexpressed in psoriatic skin lesions, systemic levels of psoriasin tended to be lower with increasing disease severity, which may be due to the presence of psoriasin-specific autoantibodies. Neither psoriasin nor psoriasin-specific autoantibodies appear to be promising serum biomarkers for clinical psoriasis."
6490394	"Two-component signaling systems, involving His kinases, His-containing phosphotransfer proteins, and response regulators, have been implicated in plant responses to hormones and environmental factors. Genomic analysis of Arabidopsis supports the existence of 22 response regulators (ARRs) that can be divided into at least two distinct groups designated type-A and type-B. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the type-B family is composed of one major and two minor subfamilies. The expression of the type-B ARRs was examined by using both reverse transcription-PCR and beta-glucuronidase fusion constructs. The major subfamily of type-B ARRs showed particularly high expression in regions where cytokinins play a significant role, including cells in the apical meristem region and in young leaves that would be undergoing cell division. Multiple members within this same subfamily of type-B ARRs were expressed near the root tip with highest expression in the root elongation zone. beta-Glucuronidase-fusions to full-length ARR2, ARR12, and ARR19 were nuclear localized, consistent with a role in transcriptional regulation. These data suggest that differing expression levels of the type-B ARRs may play a role in modulating the cellular responses to cytokinin."
8708774	"Ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury following lung transplantation is exacerbated by the destruction of the endothelial cell barrier leading to pulmonary edema and dysregulated activated lymphocyte migration. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a G-coupled protein receptor (GPCR) agonist, has been previously shown to promote endothelial cell tight junction formation and prevent monocyte chemotaxis. We asked if S1P treatment could improve pulmonary function and attenuate I/R injury following syngeneic rat lung transplantation. In comparison to vehicle-treated recipients, S1P administered before reperfusion significantly improved recipient oxygenation following transplantation. Improved graft function was associated with reduced inflammatory signaling pathway activation along with attenuated intragraft levels of MIP-2, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta. Moreover, S1P-treated recipients had significantly less apoptotic endothelial cells, pulmonary edema and graft accumulation of neutrophils than did vehicle-treated recipients. Thus our data show that S1P improves lung tissue homeostasis following reperfusion by enhancing endothelial barrier function and blunting monocytic graft infiltration and inflammation."
5671162	"The fungus Ustilago maydis is a biotrophic pathogen of maize (Zea mays). In its genome we have identified an ortholog of YAP1 (for Yeast AP-1-like) from Saccharomyces cerevisae that regulates the oxidative stress response in this organism. yap1 mutants of U. maydis displayed higher sensitivity to H(2)O(2) than wild-type cells, and their virulence was significantly reduced. U. maydis yap1 could partially complement the H(2)O(2) sensitivity of a yap1 deletion mutant of S. cerevisiae, and a Yap1-green fluorescent protein fusion protein showed nuclear localization after H(2)O(2) treatment, suggesting that Yap1 in U. maydis functions as a redox sensor. Mutations in two Cys residues prevented accumulation in the nucleus, and the respective mutant strains showed the same virulence phenotype as Deltayap1 mutants. Diamino benzidine staining revealed an accumulation of H(2)O(2) around yap1 mutant hyphae, which was absent in the wild type. Inhibition of the plant NADPH oxidase prevented this accumulation and restored virulence. During the infection, Yap1 showed nuclear localization after penetration up to 2 to 3 d after infection. Through array analysis, a large set of Yap1-regulated genes were identified and these included two peroxidase genes. Deletion mutants of these genes were attenuated in virulence. These results suggest that U. maydis is using its Yap1-controlled H(2)O(2) detoxification system for coping with early plant defense responses."
4313920	"The accumulation of H2O2 by NaCl was observed in the roots of rice seedlings. Treatment with NaCl caused an increase in the activities of ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and glutathione reductase (GR) and the expression of OsAPX and OsGR in rice roots. Exogenously applied H2O2 also enhanced the activities of APX and GR and the expression of OsAPX and OsGR in rice roots. The accumulation of H2O2 in rice roots in response to NaCl was inhibited by the NADPH oxidase inhibitors, diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI) and imidazole (IMD). However, DPI, IMD, and dimethylthiourea, a H2O2 trap, did not reduce NaCl-enhanced activities of APX and GR and expression of OsAPX and OsGR. It appears that H2O2 is not involved in the regulation of NaCl-induced APX and GR activities and OsAPX and OsGR expression in rice roots."

Psychocutaneous diseases can be either primary psychiatric or primary cutaneous, with various degrees of associations between psyche and skin. Unless the dermatologist cultivates a special interest in this field, many an invisible mental disorder may be missed leading to sub optimal treatment of the visible skin condition. Though Dermatology Psychiatry liaison clinics are common in Europe and other western countries, it is just an emerging concept in India. Here we describe the working pattern of psychodermatology liaison clinic established in Manipal in August 2010 and describe briefly the type of cases attended to."

The distribution in the skin of IgG, IgM and C3 varied with the date, type and site of the biopsy sample. Thus IF patterns showed features of (a) pemphigus vulgaris, (b) pemphigus foliaceus and (c) pemphigus erythematosus. Indirect IF examination indicated the presence of circulating intercellular epithelial antibody of both the IgG and IgM class."
5458901	"Glyoxalase I is the first enzyme of the glyoxalase system that can detoxify methylglyoxal, a cytotoxic compound increased rapidly under stress conditions. Here we report cloning and characterization of a glyoxalase I from sugar beet M14 line (an interspecific hybrid between a wild species Beta corolliflora Zoss and a cultivated species B. vulgaris L). The full-length gene BvM14-glyoxalase I has 1,449 bp in length with an open reading frame of 1,065 bp encoding 354 amino acids. Sequence analysis shows the conserved glyoxalase I domains, metal and glutathione binding sites and secondary structure (α-helixes and β-sheets). The BvM14-glyoxalase I gene was ubiquitously expressed in different tissues of sugar beet M14 line and up-regulated in response to salt, mannitol and oxidative stresses. Heterologous expression of BvM14-glyoxalase I could increase E. coli tolerance to methylglyoxal. Transgenic tobacco plants constitutively expressing BvM14-glyoxalase I were generated. Both leaf discs and seedlings showed significant tolerance to methylglyoxal, salt, mannitol and H2O2. These results suggest an important role of BvM14-glyoxalase I in cellular detoxification and tolerance to abiotic stresses."
6717856	"In renal transplant recipients, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors have been reported to protect against cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease. Here, we questioned whether mTOR inhibitors specifically influence human CMV-induced T-cell responses.                                                                              We studied renal transplant recipients treated with prednisolone, cyclosporine A (CsA), and mycophenolate sodium (MPS) for the first 6 months after transplantation followed by double therapy consisting of prednisolone/everolimus, which is an mTOR inhibitor (P/EVL; n=10), prednisolone/CsA (P/CsA; n=7), or prednisolone/MPS (P/MPS; n=9). All patients were CMV-IgG positive before transplantation. CMV reactivation was detectable in the first 6 months after transplantation and not thereafter. None of the patients included in this study suffered from CMV disease. Both CD27CD8 and CD27CD28CD4 effector-type T-cell counts, known to be associated with CMV infection, were measured before transplantation and at 6 and 24 months after transplantation. Additionally, we determined both number and function of CMV-specific CD8 T cells at these time points.                                                                              The number of total CD8 T cells, CD27CD8 T cells, and CD28CD4 T cells increased significantly after switch to therapy with P/EVL but not after switch to P/CsA or P/MPS. Specifically, CMV-specific CD8 T-cell counts significantly increased after switch to therapy with P/EVL. Furthermore, the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus strongly inhibited alloresponses in vitro, whereas it did not affect CMV-specific responses.                                                                                     We observed a significant increase in (CMV-specific) effector-type CD8 and CD4 T-cell counts in everolimus-treated patients. These findings may at least in part explain the reported low incidence of CMV-related pathology in everolimus-treated patients."

Histological examination revealed a lymphocytic vasculitis targeting the arterioles in the deep dermis. In addition, a distinct hyalinised fibrin ring was noted at the periphery of the vessel lumen. These findings were consistent with the recently described entity known as lymphocytic thrombophilic arteritis. An extensive array of investigations did not show any underlying systemic disease, and the patient has remained in good health without treatment."
5506402	"The complete nucleotide sequence of the satellite virus of St. Augustine decline virus (sSADV) has been determined. It comprises 824 nucleotides and contains a single, large open reading frame that corresponds to the coat protein of the satellite virus, as confirmed by direct amino acid sequencing. The genome contains two other potential open reading frames, similar to the organization of satellite Panicum mosaic virus (sPMV). These two satellite viruses share significant sequence homology at both the nucleotide and the amino acid levels; there are 36 nucleotide differences, resulting in five amino acid changes. Other than the close homology with sPMV, there is no homology with the known satellite viruses at the nucleotide or amino acid level, while there is some similarity in the hydropathy profiles of the coat proteins of these viruses."
9128813	"The glutathione-ascorbate redox pathway in chloroplasts is a complex network of spontaneous, photochemical, and enzymatic reactions for detoxifying hydrogen peroxide. This article presents a comprehensive sensitivity analysis of the system. A model has been constructed to simulate oxidative stress conditions, enabling steady-state concentrations of the metabolites involved in the pathway and photochemical and enzymatic fluxes to be calculated. The model includes an electron source whose flux is distributed among three competitive routes (photogeneration of O2-, photoreduction of NADP+ to NADPH, and photoreduction of monodehydroascorbate to ascorbate) and that allows the simulation of variations in NADPH concentration with time. Each enzyme considered is introduced in the model, taking into account its particular catalytic mechanism, including the inactivation of ascorbate peroxidase in the presence of low-ascorbate concentrations. Computer simulations pointed to the great sensitivity of the system to the ratio among fluxes corresponding to ascorbate and NADPH photoproduction and NADPH consumption by the Calvin cycle. Under oxidative stress conditions, the model shows a sequential depletion of antioxidant power in chloroplasts in the order NADPH, glutathione, ascorbate and their recovery in the reverse order. Decreasing levels of glutathione reductase, ascorbate peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase led to the irreversible photoinactivation of ascorbate peroxidase and the subsequent increase in hydrogen peroxide concentration, preceded by a maximum in dehydroascorbate reductase activity."
7265203	"Treatment of vitiligo is a challenge, especially in children. Recently, topical calcineurin inhibitors have been introduced in the management of vitiligo, but significant repigmentation is not achieved except on the face. Large pretibial lesions of a 15-year-old female with progressive vitiligo were treated twice daily over six months with 0.1% tacrolimus ointment on the right and 1% pimecrolimus cream on the left side without effect. Additional overnight occlusion with polyurethane and hydrocolloid foils during the following 18 months led to substantial repigmentation on both sides (tacrolimus-treated side, 88% repigmented area; pimecrolimus-treated side, 73%). Tacrolimus serum levels measured at four different time points did not exceed 1.8 ng/ml. This case report on a direct comparison of topical tacrolimus and pimecrolimus in vitiligo shows that on the shins considerable improvement could be induced with both agents only by additional long-term occlusion and that tacrolimus was somewhat more effective than pimecrolimus."
3219664	"Die Dermatologie ist zunehmend mit Patienten konfrontiert, die unter einer körperdysmorphen Störung (KDS) leiden. Die KDS ist gekennzeichnet durch die übermäßige Beschäftigung mit einem oder mehreren wahrgenommenen Defekten oder Makeln in der äußeren Erscheinung, die für andere nicht oder allenfalls minimal erkennbar sind. Bislang gibt es nur wenige Prävalenzstudien bei KDS im ambulanten dermatologischen Setting. Darüber hinaus wurde die Motivation zu psychotherapeutischer Beratung bei ambulanten dermatologischen Patienten mit körperdysmorphen Symptomen noch nicht systematisch erfasst. Ziel der vorliegenden Studie war daher, die Häufigkeit körperdysmorpher Symptome, die soziale Anpassung sowie die Motivation zu psychotherapeutischer Beratung bei ambulanten dermatologischen Patienten zu untersuchen.                                                                                                252 ambulante Patienten einer Universitäts-Hautpoliklinik wurden konsekutiv rekrutiert und mittels Dysmorphic Concerns Questionnaire, Soziale Aktivität Selbstbeurteilungs-Skala sowie Veränderungsstadien-Skala untersucht.                                                                                    7,9 % der unselektierten Gesamtstichprobe erzielten Testresultate, die auf klinisch relevante körperdysmorphe Symptome hinweisen.

2084509	"It is currently a challenge to determine the biomechanical properties of the hard tissue-dental implant interface. Recent advances in intraoral imaging and tomographic methods, such as microcomputed tomography (micro-CT), provide three-dimensional details, offering significant potential to evaluate the bone-implant interface, but yield limited information regarding osseointegration because of physical scattering effects emanating from metallic implant surfaces. In the present study, it was hypothesized that functional apparent moduli (FAM), generated from functional incorporation of the peri-implant structure, would eliminate the radiographic artifact-affected layer and serve as a feasible means to evaluate the biomechanical dynamics of tissue-implant integration in vivo.                                                                                            Cylindric titanium mini-implants were placed in osteotomies and osteotomies with defects in rodent maxillae. The layers affected by radiographic artifacts were identified, and the pattern of tissue-implant integration was evaluated from histology and micro-CT images over a 21-day observation period. Analyses of structural information, FAM, and the relationship between FAM and interfacial stiffness (IS) were done before and after eliminating artifacts.                                                                              Physical artifacts were present within a zone of about 100 to 150 Μm around the implant in both experimental defect situations (osteotomy alone and osteotomy + defect). All correlations were evaluated before and after eliminating the artifact-affected layers, most notably during the maturation period of osseointegration. A strong correlation existed between functional bone apparent modulus and IS within 300 Μm at the osteotomy defects (r >    0.9) and functional composite tissue apparent modulus in the osteotomy defects (r >    0.75).                                                                                     Micro-CT imaging and FAM were of value in measuring the temporal process of tissue-implant integration in vivo. This approach will be useful to complement imaging technologies for longitudinal monitoring of osseointegration."

3639260	"This study demonstrates that the detection of rearrangement of the T-cell receptor gene and adult T cell leukemia virus or human T cell lymphotropic virus type I (ATLV/HTLV-I) integration in the genome are sensitive and practical methods for the diagnosis and characterization of cutaneous T cell neoplasms. Biopsy specimens obtained from small skin nodules containing a dense infiltration of lymphocytes were analyzed by Southern blotting with the use of probes for both the beta-chain of the T-cell receptor gene and the ATLV/HTLV-I genome. DNA samples from one patient with early, chronic adult T cell lymphoma or leukemia, revealed the monoclonal proliferation of lymphocytes. For another patient with early cutaneous T cell lymphoma analysis by Southern blotting with the beta-chain probe of DNA from three separate lesions revealed identical rearranged bands, indicating not only the monoclonal proliferation of T cells in each lesion but also the clonal origin of each lesion. In contrast, analysis by Southern blotting of DNA samples extracted from three nodules from a patient with lymphomatoid papulosis showed no rearranged band and therefore no clonal proliferation. DNA extracted from blood lymphocytes of these patients failed to hybridize with the probes described above as a rearranged band. These results indicate that analysis of DNA extracted from skin lesions may have diagnostic value in determining monoclonal proliferation of lymphocytes in patients with early stage cutaneous lymphomas."
1969379	"Trichophyton rubrum causes 90% of chronic dermatophyte infections. Most patients with widespread chronic T. rubrum infection fail to express a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to intradermally injected trichophytin. We propose that cell-mediated immunity to T. rubrum may be suppressed in chronic infections by the mannan cell wall component of the fungus. The proposed suppressive effect of T. rubrum mannan on cell-mediated immunity was tested by measuring the ability of extracted mannan to inhibit lymphoproliferative responses of human mononuclear leukocytes to antigens, mitogens, and an anti-T-cell receptor antibody (anti-CD3) in vitro. Mannan was found to be highly antigenic in two of five donors and weakly antigenic in the other three. Despite its antigenic property, mannan exhibited a dose-related ability to inhibit lymphoproliferation stimulated by other agents including 1) antigens from Candida albicans, T. rubrum, and tetanus toxoid (ID50 = 250 micrograms/ml); 2) anti-CD3 antibody (ID50 = 250 micrograms/ml); and 3) Phaseolus limensis mitogenic lectin (ID50 = 64 micrograms/ml). Mannan added to cultures later than 24 h after initiation had no inhibitory influence, but culture of cells with mannan for a period of 24 h prior to the addition of stimulus enhanced the inhibitory effect of the glycoprotein. Lymphoproliferation in response to recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2) was not inhibited. The influence of time of addition of mannan and the failure of mannan to inhibit IL-2-stimulated lymphoproliferation demonstrate that the suppressive effect of mannan must be pharmacologic rather than cytotoxic. The observed ability of T. rubrum cell wall mannan to suppress cell-mediated immune function in vitro may provide an important clue to a mechanism enabling the fungus to avoid elimination in chronically infected patients."

The setting was a tertiary care referral center in India (Kalawati Saran Children's Hospital, New Delhi) during January 1997 to December 2003. A total of 30,078 children less than 12 years of age with 32,341 new dermatoses were recorded, with a male to female ratio of 1.07:1. Most of the disease was seen in the 1- to 5-year age group (44.94%). The most common skin diseases were infections and infestations (47.15%) consisting of bacterial infections (58.09%) and scabies (21.54%), followed by eczemas (26.95%), infantile seborrheic dermatitis, scabies, and pityriasis alba. Other unique dermatoses in our settings were papular uticaria (3.59%), miliaria (5.46%), postinflammatory pigmentary abnormalities (1.68%), and nutritional deficiency dermatoses (0.45%). A majority of patients were diagnosed clinically and special diagnostic tests were conducted in 2.6% of patients. The most common diagnostic test used was KOH mount (59.2%), followed by skin biopsy (39%). Nearly 90% of patients were seen without any referral and in the remaining, a majority were referred by pediatricians (75%). A majority of patients were diagnosed to have infection followed by dermatitis in our setting."
8881462	"DNA histograms of skin and blood specimens from 64 patients with known or suspected cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) have been examined and compared with normal blood mononuclear cells and skin biopsy samples from 50 patients with various benign cutaneous conditions (i.e. patch test infiltrates, eczema, psoriasis, lichen planus, atopic dermatitis) in an attempt to establish whether DNA measurements by flow cytometry may improve the early recognition of CTCL. The results indicate that right-skewed G0/G1 peaks are seen frequently in both benign disorders and known and suspected CTCL. Such peaks may reflect increased stainability of DNA due to chromatin dispersion during cell activation and/or cell proliferation and do not constitute reliable evidence of malignancy. In contrast, discrete aneuploid DNA peaks are confined to malignant lesions, but are seen almost exclusively in the advanced stages in which the diagnosis can be established easily based on routine histological criteria. These data indicate that DNA measurements by flow cytometry is of only limited help in the early recognition of CTCL and support the view that the lymphoid infiltrate in early CTCL may be reactive (rather than neoplastic) or alternatively may contain only minor reactive (rather than neoplastic) or alternatively may contain only minor populations of abnormal (malignant) cells which cannot be detected by currently available DNA measurement techniques."
8455698	"Evaluation of graft quality remains a major problem in liver transplantation. The aim of this retrospective analysis was to examine the impact of donor criteria on postoperative graft function. Between June 1986 and September 1993 324 liver transplantations were performed at our institution. Criteria for exclusion from analysis were postoperative thrombosis of graft vessels, retransplantation, death prior to the 5th postoperative day or missing donor criteria. For the eligible 255 transplantations the impact of the following donor criteria were examined: age (range 1-62 years, median 28 years), size/body weigt index, duration of intensive care, cause of death, circulatory condition, need for vasopressive support and liver function tests (bilirubin, GOT, GPT, GGT, LDH, ALP, prothrombin time (PT), creatinine, sodium). The following intraoperative factors were also assessed: type of protective solution, cold ischaemic time (CIT), anhepatic period and blood transfusions. Graft function during the first 5 postoperative days was categorized into four groups: (1) good function (GOT max <    1000 U/l, spontaneous PT >    50%, bile production >    100 ml/day); (2) fair function (GOT 1000-2500 U/l, clotting factor support <    2 days, bile <    100 ml/day); (3) poor function (GOT >    2500 U/l, clotting factor support >    2 days, bile <    20 ml/day); (4) primary non-function (retransplantation required within 7 days). A univariate analysis revealed duration of intensive care (P = 0.001), circulatory condition (P = 0.005), anhepatic period (P = 0.0004), blood transfusions (P = 0.03) and CIT (P = 0.039) as significant risk factors for postoperative graft function. Entering these factors in a multivariate regression model we identified creatinine (P = 0.007), duration of intensive care (P = 0.009) and the size/body weight index (P = 0.03) as donor-related factors of high significance. Analysis of the intraoperative data revealed the anhepatic period as the factor of highest significance (P = 0.0004) together with CIT (P = 0.02) and intraoperative blood transfusions (P = 0.008). A doubling of the number of days of intensive care resulted in a threefold increased risk of postoperative graft failure. Prolonged intensive care is a variable representing multiple risk factors. Accepting donors with a longer history of hypotension or who show signs such as elevated creatinine should be carefully considered. In patients with expected surgical difficulties resulting in an extended anhepatic period and a higher blood loss, transplantation of organs retrieved from donors with a long duration of intensive care and a long CIT should be avoided."
4123857	"Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma is an aggressive vascular tumor, named for its striking histologic resemblance to Kaposi sarcoma and locally invasive growth. Mortality is high, and ranges from 10% to 24% for all kaposiform hemangioendothelioma lesions, with a significantly higher mortality for deep soft-tissue or visceral lesions occurring in infants less than 6 months. Mediastinal and neck kaposiform hemangioendothelioma in particular merit special discussion, as involvement of these critical anatomic locations results in significant site-specific therapeutic challenges due to invasion of vital structures, inherent delays in establishing histopathologic confirmation, and difficulties in monitoring disease status. We report our experience with three cases of mediastinal and neck kaposiform hemangioendothelioma, emphasizing the unique diagnostic and management challenges, variable response to treatment and outcome of this anatomic variant of kaposiform hemangioendothelioma."
6360314	"Potted Colchium plants were subjected to a temperature of 4°C±1° for 2 1/2 to 27 weeks between April and November (1959) and then planted in the garden.Some plants flowered during the fall of the same year in spite of the cold treatment; some of them even flowered during the cold treatment itself. In other plants, the fall flowering of that year was suppressed to different degrees depending on the treatment.Plants that had been exposed to at least 13 weeks of low temperature after the middle of July had some of their fall buds arrested in the development and only flowered in the following spring. Any earlier or later cold treatment was without effect on the time of flowering.Thus the normally fall flowering Colchium was forced by experimental means to flower in spring. This effect resembles the spontaneous spring flowering that is sometimes observed in nature and which has been subject to controversial interpretations.None of the plants that flowered in the spring following the experimental year continued this behavior during consecutive years. The fall flowering of the year following on the experimental year was also influenced by the time and duration of the cold treatment. This indicates that the effects of the cold treatment reached into the next generation of bulbs."
9640354	"Inflammatory chemokines, such as macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC/CCL22), are elevated in the serum and lesioned skin of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD), and are ligands for C-C chemokine receptor 4, which is predominantly expressed on T helper 2 lymphocytes, basophils and natural killer cells. We have previously reported that quercetagetin has an inhibitory activity on inflammatory chemokines, which is induced by interferon (IFN)-γ and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, occurring via inhibition of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) signal.                                                                                   To investigate the specific mechanisms of quercetagetin on the STAT1 signal.                                                                              We confirmed the inhibitory activity of quercetagetin on MDC and STAT1 in HaCaT keratinocytes. The interaction between STAT1 and IFN-γR1 was investigated using immunoprecipitation. The small interfering RNA approach was used to investigate the role of suppressor of cytokine signalling 1 (SOCS1) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 induced by quercetagetin.                                                                              Quercetagetin inhibited the expression of MDC at both the protein and mRNA levels in IFN-γ- and TNF-α-stimulated HaCaT human keratinocytes. Moreover, quercetagetin inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT1 through upregulation of SOCS1. Increased expression of SOCS1 disrupted the binding of STAT1 to IFN-γR1. Furthermore, quercetagetin augmented the expression of TGF-β1, which is known to modulate the immune response and inflammation.                                                                                      These results suggest that quercetagetin may be a potent inhibitor of the STAT1 signal, which could be a new molecular target for anti-inflammatory treatment, and may thus have therapeutic applications as an immune modulator in inflammatory diseases such as AD."

It tends to be resistant to both topical and systemic treatments for psoriasis. We present an infant with Acrodermatitis Continua of Hallopeau affecting nineteen nails, with an excellent response to the combination of thalidomide and ultraviolet B phototherapy."
5770409	"The dynamics of heat loss by 2 patients with classic anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia were studied. Both were active in high school athletics and avoided heat injuries by various forms of behavior modification. Elevated core and skin temperature measurements were found at rest in comfortable environments. In a warm environment 35-45% of the heat generated was lost by radiation, 44-52% by conduction and convection, and only 4-6% by evaporation. Heat loss in control subjects was 9% by radiation, 17% by conduction/convection, and 67% by evaporation. The dry routes of heat dissipation used by the anhidrotic patients were inadequate to prevent a rise in core temperature."
1374865	"Previous epidemiological studies of overall alcohol intake and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) are inconsistent, with some evidence for differences by type of alcoholic beverage. While alcohol may enhance the carcinogenicity of ultraviolet (UV) radiation, this has not been evaluated in existing epidemiological studies.                                                                                   To evaluate alcohol intake in relation to early-onset BCC, and explore potential interactions with UV exposure.                                                                              Basal cell carcinoma cases (n = 380) and controls with benign skin conditions (n = 390) under 40 years of age were identified through Yale Dermatopathology. Participants provided information on lifetime alcohol intake, including type of beverage, during an in-person interview. Self-reported data on indoor tanning and outdoor sunbathing were used to categorize UV exposure. We calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using unconditional multivariate logistic regression in the full sample and in women only.                                                                              There was no statistically significant association between lifetime alcohol intake and early-onset BCC overall [above median intake vs. no regular alcohol intake (OR 1·10, 95% CI 0·69-1·73)] or in women only (OR 1·21, 95% CI 0·73-2·01). Similarly, intake of red wine, white wine, beer or spirits and mixed drinks was not associated with early-onset BCC. In exploratory analyses, we saw limited evidence for an interaction (P(interaction) = 0·003), with highest risk for high alcohol and high UV exposures, especially in women, but subgroup risk estimates had wide and overlapping CIs.                                                                                      Overall, we did not observe any clear association between lifetime alcohol intake and early-onset BCC."
5338143	"A survey, using a postal questionnaire, was carried out to examine the current practice of UVB phototherapy in dermatology centres in the U.K. The questionnaire was sent to 115 dermatology departments, and sought information regarding the type and age of each machine used for ultraviolet B (UVB) phototherapy, methods of prescribing, recording and terminating patient exposure, and the skin conditions treated. Completed questionnaires were received from 87 of the 115 centres, giving a response rate of 76%. The survey showed that an appreciable number of U.K. phototherapy centres are using equipment which is both old, and suboptimal in producing a therapeutic response. There appeared to be a wide variation in the approach to phototherapy, both in terms of prescribing initial and incremental exposure, and in terminating treatment. The findings suggest that effectiveness and efficiency might be improved, and the risk/benefit ratio of phototherapy further reduced, by some rationalization of treatment protocols."
3699054	"The large genome size of many species hinders the development and application of genomic tools to study them. For instance, loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.), an ecologically and economically important conifer, has a large and yet uncharacterized genome of 21.7 Gbp. To characterize the pine genome, we performed exome capture and sequencing of 14 729 genes derived from an assembly of expressed sequence tags. Efficiency of sequence capture was evaluated and shown to be similar across samples with increasing levels of complexity, including haploid cDNA, haploid genomic DNA and diploid genomic DNA. However, this efficiency was severely reduced for probes that overlapped multiple exons, presumably because intron sequences hindered probe:exon hybridizations. Such regions could not be entirely avoided during probe design, because of the lack of a reference sequence. To improve the throughput and reduce the cost of sequence capture, a method to multiplex the analysis of up to eight samples was developed. Sequence data showed that multiplexed capture was reproducible among 24 haploid samples, and can be applied for high-throughput analysis of targeted genes in large populations. Captured sequences were de novo assembled, resulting in 11 396 expanded and annotated gene models, significantly improving the knowledge about the pine gene space. Interspecific capture was also evaluated with over 98% of all probes designed from P. taeda that were efficient in sequence capture, were also suitable for analysis of the related species Pinus elliottii Engelm."
8090154	"It was previously reported that telomere homologue oligonucleotides (T-oligos) can induce a variety of cellular responses in skin including increased melanogenesis. To assess the effects of T-oligos on hair pigmentation, we administered thymidine dinucleotide (pTT), one-third of the TTAGGG telomere repeat sequence, intradermally at distinct time points of the depilation-induced hair cycle in C3H/HeJ mice. Penetration of T-oligos into the hair follicle (HF) was monitored by using FITC-labelled pTT and confocal microscopy. pTT treatment on days 1-5 after depilation, during early anagen, did not significantly alter the number and proliferation of melanocytes (Trp-2-positive cells), compared with vehicle-treated controls. However, pTT treatment on days 5-12 after depilation, during mid- to late anagen, resulted in the formation of darker hairs, that showed a significantly increased eumelanin/total melanin ratio in their sub-apical agouti band region, compared with vehicle-treated controls (P <    0.05). By RT-PCR and western blot, full thickness skin of pTT-treated mice showed increases in Trp-1, Trp-2 and tyrosinase mRNA and protein levels, compared with control mice. Western blot analyses of two receptors that positively regulate eumelanogenesis, melanocortin type 1 receptor (MC-1R) and kit, showed increased expression of MC-1R protein in pTT-treated versus control skin, while the levels of c-kit receptor remained unchanged. These data demonstrate that pTT treatment increases eumelanogenesis in HFs, associated with increased tyrosinase, TRP-1 and MC-1R expression. These data also raise the possibility of using T-oligos to modulate hair pigmentation."
7027907	"We examined the effects of daily topical application of 0.05% tretinoin cream on photodamaged Caucasian facial skin by electron microscopy. Specimens obtained pretreatment, after 6 and 12 months of tretinoin therapy (20 patients), and after 6 months of vehicle treatment (5 patients) were compared in a blinded fashion, with special attention to the dermoepidermal junction and papillary dermis. Baseline specimens disclosed various degrees of damage including reduplication of basal lamina, smudging and sparsity of collagen fibers, and nodular arrangement of degenerated microfibrils in the papillary dermis. No significant changes were observed at 6 months in the papillary dermis of either tretinoin-treated or vehicle-treated patients. After 12 months of tretinoin treatment, however, disorganized collagen fibers, which were conspicuous in 11 patients at baseline, were replaced by new well-organized collagen fibers in a wavy pattern in 6 patients. In addition, the amount of nodularly degenerated microfibrillar material decreased in 15 of 18 patients with this finding at baseline. In contrast, no significant change was noted in the number of anchoring fibrils per unit length of the lamina densa. These observations provide further evidence that topical treatment with 0.05% tretinoin produces papillary dermal reconstruction, for which more than 6 months of application were required."
4921964	"The plant hormone auxin is secreted in root apices via phospholipase Dzeta2 (PLDzeta2) activity which produces specific population of phosphatidic acid that stimulates secretion of vesicles enriched with auxin. These vesicles were reported to be localized at plant synapses which are active in auxin secretion, especially at the transition zone of the root apex. There are several implications of this vesicular secretion of auxin. In root apices, auxin emerges as plant neurotransmitter-like signal molecule which coordinates activities of adjacent cells via electric and chemical signaling. Putative quantal release of auxin after electrical stimulation, if confirmed, would be part of neuronal communication between plant cells. As auxin transport across plant synapses is tightly linked with integrated sensory perception of environment, especially of omnipresent gravity and light, this process is proposed to mediate the plant perception of environment. These neuronal features allow sessile plants to integrate multitude of sensory signals into the adaptive behavior of whole plants and the animal-like exploratory behavior of growing roots."
4709284	"Although cavitation and refilling cycles could be common in plants, it is unknown whether these cycles weaken the cavitation resistance of xylem. Stem or petiole segments were tested for cavitation resistance before and after a controlled cavitation-refilling cycle. Cavitation was induced by centrifugation, air drying of shoots, or soil drought. Except for droughted plants, material was not significantly water stressed prior to collection. Cavitation resistance was determined from ""vulnerability curves"" showing the percentage loss of conductivity versus xylem pressure. Two responses were observed. ""Resilient"" xylem (Acer negundo and Alnus incana stems) showed no change in cavitation resistance after a cavitation-refilling cycle. In contrast, ""weakened"" xylem (Populus angustifolia, P. tremuloides, Helianthus annuus stems, and Aesculus hippocastanum petioles) showed considerable reduction in cavitation resistance. Weakening was observed whether cavitation was induced by centrifugation, air dehydration, or soil drought. Observations from H. annuus showed that weakening was proportional to the embolism induced by stress. Air injection experiments indicated that the weakened response was a result of an increase in the leakiness of the vascular system to air seeding. The increased air permeability in weakened xylem could result from rupture or loosening of the cellulosic mesh of interconduit pit membranes during the water stress and cavitation treatment."
2532425	"We describe a rare case of unilateral leiomyoma of the nipple in a man presenting with pruritus of the nipple for 3 months. A conservative surgical excision is performed for diagnosis. Histologic examination and immunostaining confirmed the diagnosis of leiomyoma. The leiomyoma is completely excised, and the patient denies pruritus after surgery. Conservative surgical excision of a persistently hard and pruritic nipple can be effectively used as both diagnostic measure and treatment modality."
7077228	"In the January issue of New Phytologist Vallejo-Marín and O'Brien1 documented that in the genus Solanum (Solanaceae) clonality and self-incompatibility, a common genetic mechanism enforcing cross-fertilization, co-occur more often than expected by chance. Using a phylogenetic approach the authors showed that the statistical association between clonality and self-incompatibility persists even after taking into account phylogenetic relationships among species, uncertainty in the phylogenetic reconstruction, and associations between clonality and life history (annual/perennial). Vallejo-Marín and O'Brien1 suggest that clonality and self-incompatibility tend to co-occur because clonality, by allowing the persistence and propagation of a genotype in environments with limited pollinator or mate availability, reduces the selective pressure favoring the breakdown of self-incompatibility. In addition to promoting the maintenance of self-incompatibility, when clonality results in the spatial aggregation of genetically identical individuals, clonality may promote its breakdown by restricting pollen transfer between different genotypes. Here I call attention to these contradictory predictions of the effects of clonality on the evolution of self-incompatibility, and suggest that the outcome of this paradox depend on both the extent to which clonal propagation compensates for limited seed production, and on the extent to which clonality reduces pollen transfer between genotypes."
8665623	"This study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of iron sucrose in hemodialysis (HD) patients with documented hypersensitivity reactions to iron dextran. Of 205 HD patients who received low molecular weight iron dextran, 15 (7.3%) patients developed documented hypersensitivity reactions. The patients were treated with iron sucrose (100 mg administered as an intravenous push over 5-10 minutes once a week) for 8 weeks. Complete blood count, serum iron, serum ferritin, and parathyroid hormone were measured at the beginning and at the end of the study (except parathyroid hormone). All patients received subcutaneous erythropoietin at a constant dose of 5000 IU twice weekly unless a change was required. All the patients completed the study period and none of them developed hypersensitivity reactions to iron sucrose. The mean hematocrit increased from 23.8% to 32.27% (p <    0.0001), the mean serum ferritin from 185 ng/mL to 599 ng/mL (p <    0.0001), and the mean serum iron from 29.3 ng/dL to 76.8 ng/dL (p = 0.01). We conclude that iron sucrose is safe and effective in HD patients with documented hypersensitivity reactions to low molecular weight iron dextran."
1668475	"Idiopathic calcinosis of the scrotum is a rare condition of unknown etiology. As counterparts of this male disorder, only two female cases have been reported. We report a third case, the first of its kind, in Japan. Histochemical stains revealed acid mucopolysaccharide (acid-MPS) within the calcinosis and many infiltrated mast cells near it; these might histogenese the calcium deposition. Immunohistochemically, polyclonal carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and keratin stains revealed no positive cells near the calcium depositions."
4285435	"The starch excess phenotype of Arabidopsis mutants defective in the starch phosphorylating enzyme glucan, water dikinase (EC 2.7.9.4) indicates that phosphorylation of starch is required for its degradation. However, the underlying mechanism has not yet been elucidated. In this study, two in vivo systems have been established that allow the analysis of phosphorylation of transitory starch during both biosynthesis in the light and degradation in darkness. First, a photoautotrophic culture of the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was used to monitor the incorporation of exogenously supplied (32)P orthophosphate into starch. Illuminated cells incorporated (32)P into starch with a constant rate during 2 h. By contrast, starch phosphorylation in darkened cells exceeded that in illuminated cells within the first 30 min, but subsequently phosphate incorporation declined. Pulse-chase experiments performed with (32)P/(31)P orthophosphate revealed a high turnover of the starch-bound phosphate esters in darkened cells but no detectable turnover in illuminated cells. Secondly, leaf starch granules were isolated from potato (Solanum tuberosum) plants grown under controlled conditions and glucan chains from the outer granule layer were released by isoamylase. Phosphorylated chains were purified and analyzed using high performance anion-exchange chromatography and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. Glucans released from the surface of starch granules that had been isolated from darkened leaves possessed a considerably higher degree of phosphorylation than those prepared from leaves harvested during the light period. Thus, in the unicellular alga as well as in potato leaves, net starch degradation is accompanied with an increased phosphorylation of starch."
1283439	Erythema nodosum (EN) is a panniculitis frequently encountered secondary to medical therapy. We present a case of a 66-year-old gentleman with JAK2-positive myelofibrosis who developed transient EN-like lesions on his trunk and upper and lower extremities approximately three weeks after starting lenalidomide therapy.

5917846	A 55-year-old black woman with an eight-year history of prurigo nodularis was treated successfully with blistering cryotherapy. Cryotherapy resulted in smooth macule formation and afforded extended relief of pruritus. Several standard modalities of treatment had been used previously and had resulted in only partial relief of symptoms and minimal reduction of nodule size. This case demonstrates that cryotherapy can be a useful therapeutic alternative for prurigo nodularis.
7654911	"The NF-κB pathway performs pivotal roles in diverse physiological processes such as immunity, inflammation, proliferation, and apoptosis. NF-κB is kept inactive in the cytoplasm through association with inhibitors (IκB), and translocates to the nucleus to activate its target genes after the IκBs are phosphorylated and degraded. Here, we demonstrate that loss of function of SHANK-associated RH domain interacting protein (SHARPIN) leads to activation of NF-κB signaling in skin, resulting in the development of an idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (IHES) with eosinophilic dermatitis in C57BL/KaLawRij-Sharpin(cpdm)/RijSunJ mice, and clonal expansion of B-1 B cells and CD3(+)CD4(-)CD8(-) T cells. Transcription profiling in skin revealed constitutive activation of classical NF-κB pathways, predominantly by overexpressed members of IL1 family. Compound-null mutants for both the IL1 receptor accessory protein (Il1rap(tm1Roml)) and SHARPIN (Sharpin(cpdm)) resulted in mice having decreased skin disease severity. Inhibition of IκBA degradation by the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib alleviated the dermatitis in Sharpin(cpdm) mice. These results indicate that absence of SHARPIN causes IHES with eosinophilic dermatitis by NF-κB activation, and bortezomib may be an effective treatment for skin problems of IHES."
6765557	"In this study the skin permeation and the topical anti-inflammatory properties of ginger extracts were investigated. A commercial ginger dry extract (DE) and a gingerols-enriched dry extract (EDE) were evaluated for their in vivo topical anti-inflammatory activity by inhibition of Croton oil-induced ear oedema in mice. Furthermore, the feasibility of an anti-inflammatory plaster containing DE or EDE was evaluated. Since the in vivo activity was evaluated in mice, the ex vivo skin permeation study was performed by using mouse skin or human epidermis. The DE from the acetonic solution exerted a dose-dependent topical anti-inflammatory activity (ID (50) = 142 microg/cm (2)), not far from that of the potent reference substance indomethacin (ID (50) = 93 microg/cm (2)). Similarly, the EDE induced a dose-dependent oedema reduction though its potency (ID (50) = 181 microg/cm (2)) was slightly lower than that of DE. Increase of the 6-gingerol concentration in the extract did not improve the anti-inflammatory activity. The medicated plasters, containing 1 mg/cm (2) of the commercial DE or EDE, had good technological characteristics and exerted a significant antiphlogistic effect, too. By using the plaster containing EDE, the 6-gingerol amount that permeated through human epidermis was 6.9 microg/cm (2) while the amount that passed through mouse skin was 22.1 microg/cm (2). Nevertheless, the amounts of 6-gingerol permeated through human epidermis and mouse skin in the early period (8h) were comparable (p >    0.3). This preliminary result suggests that the anti-inflammatory effect observed in mice could also be exerted in humans."
7078874	"We sought to study microchimerism in a group of kidney transplant recipients.                                                                                            In this study, the peripheral blood microchimerism (PBM) after renal transplantation was retrospectively evaluated in 32 male-to-female recipients of living unrelated or cadaveric donor renal transplants. Using a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification specific for SRY region of the Y chromosome, microchimerism was detected with a sensitivity of 1:1,000,000. Recipients were compared according to the presence of PBM, acute and chronic rejection episodes, type of allotransplant, recipient and donor age at transplantation, previous male labor or blood transfusion, allograft function (serum creatinine level), and body mass index.                                                                              Among 32 recipients, 7 (21.9%) were positive for PBM upon multiple testing at various posttransplant times. All microchimeric recipients had received kidneys from living unrelated donors. No significant difference was observed with regard to other parameters. In addition the acute rejection rate in the microchimeric group was 3 (42%) versus 4 (16%) in the nonmicrochimeric recipients (not significant).                                                                                     Our results suggested better establishment of microchimerism after living donor kidney transplantation. However, doubt persists concerning the true effect of microchimerism after renal transplantation. It seems that microchimerism alone has no major protective role upon renal allograft survival."
1642381	"Leprosy is characterized by a disease spectrum having two polar clinical forms dependent on the presence or not of cell-mediated immunity. In the tuberculoid forms, granuloma-activated macrophages kill Mycobacterium leprae in conjunction with a Th1 response while, in multibacillary (MB) lesions, M. leprae nonactivated macrophages infiltrate the nerves and internal organs together with a Th2 response. The functional properties and activation pathways of macrophages isolated from patients with MB leprosy remain only partially understood.                                                                                   To establish an ex vivo methodology capable of evaluating the activation pathways, grade and fate of cultured macrophages isolated from MB lesions.                                                                              Skin biopsies from patients with borderline tuberculoid, bordeline lepromatous and lepromatous leprosy (LL) were characterized by immunohistochemistry and transcriptional analysis. To isolate inflammatory cells, a portion of the samples was submitted to enzymatic digestion. These same cells, maintained in culture for a minimum 7-day period, were characterized morphologically and via flow cytometry at different culture time points. Cytokine [interferon (IFN)-gamma, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-10] mRNA levels were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction and protein secretion in the culture supernatants was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the nitric oxide levels by Griess reagent.                                                                              RNA expression in tuberculoid and MB lesions showed the profile expected of characteristic Th1 and Th2 responses, respectively. The inflammatory cells in all biopsies were successfully isolated. Although the number of cells varied between biopsies, it was highest in LL biopsies. The frequency of isolated CD14+ and CD3+ cells measured by flow cytometry correlated with the percentages of macrophages and lymphocytes in the lesions. Throughout the culture period, CD68+ macrophages showed morphological changes. A progressive increase in cell number and reduction of infected cells were perceptible in the cultures. In contrast to the biopsies, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma and IL-10 expression in the tuberculoid and MB leprosy cells in 24-h culture and the cytokine levels in the supernatants did not differ significantly. During the culture period, cytokine expression in the MB cells progressively declined, whereas, from days 1 to 7, nitrite levels progressively increased. After day 40, the remaining macrophages were able to ingest fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled M. leprae. These data need to be confirmed.                                                                                      This study confirmed the feasibility of obtaining ex vivo macrophages from leprosy lesions and keeping them in long-term culture. This procedure may open new pathways to studying the interaction between M. leprae and human macrophages, which might, in turn, lead to the development of therapeutic tools capable of overcoming the specific anergy found in patients with MB leprosy."
4850289	"Recurrent focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) after renal transplantation with nephrotic syndrome is a serious problem with a high risk of graft loss. The therapeutic role of renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) blockers in recurrent FSGS is not clear. We present the safety and efficacy of an intensified triple RAS blockade with an ACE-inhibitor, an AT 1 receptor blocker and the direct renin inhibitor aliskiren in a 29-year-old renal transplant recipient with biopsy proven recurrence of FSGS and relapsing severe nephrotic syndrome. We subsequently used full dose ramipril, candesartan and aliskiren under a close monitoring of kidney function and electrolytes and examined the effect on proteinuria, clinical course and tolerability over 12 months. We found a significant and sustained antiproteinuric effect under triple RAS blockade. RAS blockade was generally well tolerated. This can offer a new therapeutic approach in selected hypertensive patients with recurrent FSGS."
9830922	Darier disease is an uncommon genodermatosis characterized by verrucous papules in a seborrheic distribution. The linear form of this disease is rare and could result from genetic mosaicism in this autosomal dominant disorder. We report a case of linear Darier disease that involved the right lower limb with a zosteriform distribution.
2788317	"Psoriasis is a common, chronic immune-mediated inflammatory skin disorder that significantly impacts quality of life and has potential systemic complications. The majority of psoriatic patients have mild to moderate disease and are adequately controlled with topical medications. However, approximately 20% of patients have moderate-to-severe disease. Phototherapy has remained a mainstay option for patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis resistant to topical treatments due to its efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and relative lack of side effects, in particular a lack of systemic immunosuppression seen with traditional and biologic systemic therapies. There are several well-established guidelines for phototherapy treatment of psoriasis proposed in the United States by the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD), in Europe by the European S3, and in the United Kingdom by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). The guidelines set by these groups are largely based on current evidence or expert panel consensus where evidence is lacking. This article reviews and compares the current recommendations of these guidelines for psoriasis phototherapy in regards to the initial clinical encounter, dosage, adverse reactions, and special considerations.<   br />   <   br />    <   em>   J Drugs Dermatol<   /em>   . 2016;15(8):995-1000."
3777020	"A novel dominant mutant designated 'dwarf in light 1' (dfl1-D) was isolated from screening around 1200 Arabidopsis activation-tagged lines. dfl1-D has a shorter hypocotyl under blue, red and far-red light, but not in darkness. Inhibition of cell elongation in shoots caused an exaggerated dwarf phenotype in the adult plant. The lateral root growth of dfl1-D was inhibited without any reduction of primary root length. The genomic DNA adjacent to the right border of T-DNA was cloned by plasmid rescue. The rescued genomic DNA contained a gene encoding a GH3 homologue. The transcript was highly accumulated in the dfl1-D. The dfl1-D phenotype was confirmed by over-expression of the gene in the wild-type plant. The dfl1-D showed resistance to exogenous auxin treatment. Moreover, over-expression of antisense DFL1 resulted in larger shoots and an increase in the number of lateral roots. These results indicate that the gene product of DFL1 is involved in auxin signal transduction, and inhibits shoot and hypocotyl cell elongation and lateral root cell differentiation in light."
7468732	"After allogenic transplantations, a dramatic increase in the development of arteriosclerotic plaques can be observed, which might be due to metabolic alterations, changes in the transplant organ, or the immunosuppression regimen. Many studies have demonstrated beneficial effects of tacrolimus compared with cyclosporine with regard to these conditions. These results have suggested that conversion to tacrolimus from cyclosporine is advantageous. Our study investigated whether patients with deteriorating renal function profit from this conversion. Thirty renal transplant patients were studied retrospectively, using data recorded from 3 years before to 3 years after conversion from cyclosporine to tacrolimus. While renal function (GFR) deteriorated progressively under cyclosporine, it stabilized and even improved under tacrolimus (creatinine: DeltaCyc = +1.4 mg/d; DeltaTac = -0.7 mg/dL; GFR: DeltaCyc = -35 mL/min; DeltaTac = 14 mL/min). In addition, uric acid levels (7.0 mg/dL vs 6.4 mg/dL, P <    .05) and cholesterol levels (258 mg/dL vs 225 mg/dL, P <    .05) were both significantly lower under tacrolimus. Conversion from cyclosporine to tacrolimus is recommended for kidney transplant patients in whom there has been a progressive fall in renal function. It leads to stabilization or even improvement of transplant function and a reduction in cardiovascular risk factors."
1399052	"As most efforts in the last decade have focused on the immunologic basis of inflammatory skin disease, there has been less emphasis on the role of the nervous system in the disease process of psoriasis. Evidence in support of the neurocutaneous pathway has come from observations of patients experiencing unilateral improvement and even complete remission following nerve damage in the affected dermatomal region. The aim of this review was to investigate the role of neuropeptides in the intricate pathophysiology of psoriasis. The PubMed database was searched for individual case reports or case series that reported clearance or significant improvement in psoriatic disease in patients following documented nerve injury. A total of 11 cases were found that reported improvement of psoriatic lesions in areas afflicted by central or peripheral nerve injury. The most common causes of denervation were inadvertent surgical interruption, cerebrovascular accident, and poliomyelitis. In four cases the patients eventually regained neurologic function, which was associated with a recurrence of skin lesions. In cases of permanent nerve damage, there was remission of psoriasis. The cases reported in the literature to date provide clinical evidence that absence of neural input leads to psoriasis improvement, suggesting a crucial role of the nervous system in the pathophysiology of psoriatic disease. In fact, neuropeptides such as nerve growth factor, substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and vasoactive intestinal peptide may be important contributors of psoriatic disease and potential targets for future therapies."
8677098	"The ATP2A2 gene encodes Ca2+-dependent ATPase, the dysfunction of which causes Darier disease. In this study, we analyzed the promoter structure of the human ATP2A2 gene using primary normal human keratinocytes (NHK). Reporter assays showed that deletion of -550/-529, -488/-472, -390/-362, or -42/-21 resulted in a significant decrease in human ATP2A2 promoter activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed that Sp1 is a transcription factor that binds to the -550/-529 and -488/-472 regions of the promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay demonstrated that Sp1, but not Sp3, binds to the promoter region of the ATP2A2 gene in NHK cells in vivo. Knockdown of Sp1 expression by small interfering RNA resulted in a marked reduction in ATP2A2 promoter activity and ATP2A2 mRNA levels in NHK, suggesting that Sp1 positively transactivates the ATP2A2 promoter in NHK. This is early evidence demonstrating that Sp1 plays an important and positive role in ATP2A2 gene expression in NHK in vivo and in vitro."

4563806	"The screening of enhancer detector lines in Arabidopsis thaliana has identified genes that are specifically expressed in the sporophytic tissue of the ovule. One such gene is the MADS-domain transcription factor AGAMOUS-LIKE6 (AGL6), which is expressed asymmetrically in the endothelial layer of the ovule, adjacent to the developing haploid female gametophyte. Transcription of AGL6 is regulated at multiple stages of development by enhancer and silencer elements located in both the upstream regulatory region and the large first intron. These include a bipartite enhancer, which requires elements in both the upstream regulatory region and the first intron, active in the endothelium. Transcription of the AGL13 locus, which encodes the other member of the AGL6 subfamily in Arabidopsis, is also regulated by elements located in the upstream regulatory region and in the first intron. There is, however, no overlapping expression of AGL6 and AGL13 except in the chalaza of the developing ovule, as was shown using a dual gene reporter system. Phylogenetic shadowing of the first intron of AGL6 and AGL13 homologs from other Brassicaceae identified four regions of conservation that probably contain the binding sites of transcriptional regulators, three of which are conserved outside Brassicaceae. Further phylogenetic analysis using the protein-encoding domains of AGL6 and AGL13 revealed that the MADS DNA-binding domain shows considerable divergence. Together, these results suggest that AGL6 and AGL13 show signs of subfunctionalization, with divergent expression patterns, regulatory sequences and possibly functions."
8029285	"Organ transplantations are among the most expensive surgical treatments performed today, but estimates of the costs of organ transplantations vary widely between settings. The aim of this study is to estimate the costs of renal, liver and heart transplantation in a university hospital, adopting a similar costing methodology for all the three kinds of transplantation. Resource use data were collected from 803 patients transplanted between January 1995 and August 2001. Data about the time physicians and other hospital employees spent per transplantation were based on interviews. All costs from pretransplantation screening up to 3 years post-transplantation were taken into account and divided into costs of patient care and programme-related costs. Mean cost of renal transplantation varied from 70,723 Euros for cadaveric donor transplantations to 76,577 Euros for living donor transplantations. Mean costs of liver transplantation were 141,510 Euros and the mean costs of heart transplantation were 17, 828 Euros. Direct costs of patient care contributed to 79%, 87% and 92% of the costs of renal, liver and heart transplantation respectively. Inpatient hospital days were the largest contributor to the costs of patient care. The mean number of inpatient hospital days from pretransplantation screening to 3 years post-transplantation varied from 46 days for renal transplantation from a living donor to 58 days for renal transplantation from cadaveric donors, 83 days for heart transplantation and 108 days for liver transplantation. In conclusion, costs of liver and heart transplantation were approximately 2.0 and 2.5 times higher than the cost of renal transplantation. Length of inpatient hospital stay for transplantation did not change substantially over time between 1995 and 2001."
2189202	"Research in plant science laboratories often involves usage of many different species, cultivars, ecotypes, mutants, alleles or transgenic lines. This creates a great challenge to keep track of the identity of experimental plants and stored samples or seeds.                                                                              Here, we describe PlantDB - a Microsoft(R) Office Access database - with a user-friendly front-end for managing information relevant for experimental plants. PlantDB can hold information about plants of different species, cultivars or genetic composition. Introduction of a concise identifier system allows easy generation of pedigree trees. In addition, all information about any experimental plant - from growth conditions and dates over extracted samples such as RNA to files containing images of the plants - can be linked unequivocally.                                                                                     We have been using PlantDB for several years in our laboratory and found that it greatly facilitates access to relevant information."
5775860	"Simple cold storage of canine small intestine is accompanied by ischemic damage to the intestinal mucosa. Progression of damage observed during cold storage is unique and has not been observed with other organs. The mucosal damage begins within 15 min after the onset of the storage, with progressive involvement of the gut as the storage period lengthens. Cytoplasmic blebs develop from the base of the epithelial cells and detach the epithelium from the basal lamina. While the process begins uniformly along the length of the villus, separation of the epithelium occurs first at the villus tip. The epithelium, which is shed into the intestinal lumen, is otherwise undamaged. Blebbing occurs in enteroendocrine and goblet cells and is not restricted to enterocytes. Early blebs occur in proximity to mucosal mast cells and subepithelial nerves. Tissue damage in cold is possibly related to enzymes that are still active at storage temperatures."
4179143	"Six patients with malignant lymphoma of lymphoblastic type involving cutaneous sites at time of diagnosis are presented. Skin sites of the head and neck were involved in all patients and included the scalp (three patients), forehead (two patients), and malar region of the face (one patient). Two patients also had additional sites of skin disease (neck, breast, and anterior trunk). In two patients the skin was the predominant site of disease, whereas in the remaining patients staging workup revealed generalized lymphoma. The histologic findings in each patient were typical of lymphoblastic lymphoma; the neoplastic cells were small with blastic nuclear chromatin. In three patients the neoplastic cells were convoluted, and in three they were nonconvoluted. Immunophenotypically, four lymphomas were of pre-B cell type, and two lymphomas were of T cell type. There was no correlation between histologic features and the immunophenotype. Since the majority of lymphoblastic lymphomas are of T cell type, the predominance of pre-B cell tumors involving the skin may suggest that pre-B cell neoplasms have a predilection for cutaneous involvement. In further support of this hypothesis, both lymphomas that appear to have arisen in the skin had a pre-B cell immunophenotype."

Our purpose was to determine the effects of these drugs on in vivo production of various cytokines.                                                                              Serum cytokine levels were measured sequentially by radioimmunoassay in psoriasis patients treated with either cyclosporine or etretinate.                                                                              Interferon-gamma levels were initially elevated and rapidly returned to baseline levels before clinical improvement in both treatment groups. A transient increase before the relapse was also observed in some patients. Etretinate treatment resulted in a substantial decrease in tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels, whereas an unpredictable increase was found during the late phase of cyclosporine treatment.                                                                                     The in vivo effects of antipsoriatic drugs on cytokine production are different from those demonstrated in vitro. Measurement of serum cytokine levels is useful for monitoring patients with psoriasis."
9931101	"In this work, suspension-cultured cells of Linum usitatissimum L. were used to evaluate the effect of two types of cyclodextrins, β-glucan and (Z)-3-hexenol separately or in combination on phytosterol and tocopherol production. Suspension-cultured cells of L. usitatissimum were able to produce high levels of phytosterols in the presence of 50 mM methylated-β-cyclodextrins (1325.96 ± 107.06 μg g dry weight(-1)) separately or in combination with β-glucan (1278.57 ± 190.10 μg g dry weight(-1)) or (Z)-3-hexenol (1507.88 ± 173.02 μg g dry weight(-1)), being cyclodextrins able to increase both the secretion and accumulation of phytosterols in the spent medium, whereas β-glucan and (Z)-3-hexenol themselves only increased its intracellular accumulation. Moreover, the phytosterol values found in the presence of hydroxypropylated-β-cyclodextrins were lower than those found in the presence of methylated-β-cyclodextrins in all cases studied. However, the results showed that the presence of methylated-β-cyclodextrins did not increase the tocopherols production and only an increase in tocopherol levels was observed when cells were elicited with 50 mM hydroxypropylated-β-cyclodextrins in combination with β-glucan (174 μg g dry weight(-1)) or (Z)-3-hexenol (257 μg g dry weight(-1)). Since the levels of tocopherol produced in the combined treatment were higher than the sum of the individual treatments, a synergistic effect between both elicitors was assumed. To sum up, flax cell cultures elicited with cyclodextrins alone or in combination with β-glucan or (Z)-3-hexenol were able produce phytosterols and tocopherols, and therefore, these elicited suspension-cultured cells of L. usitatissimum can provide an alternative system, which is at the same time more sustainable, economical and ecological for their production."
5168058	"Renal diseases in diabetes include diabetic nephropathies (DN) and non-diabetic renal diseases (NDRD). The clinical differentiation between these two categories is usually not so clear and effective. This study aims to develop a quantified differential diagnostic model.                                                                              We consecutively screened the diabetic patients with overt proteinuria but no severe renal failure for kidney biopsy from 1993 to 2003. The finally enrolled 110 patients were divided into two groups according to pathological features (60 in DN group and 50 in NDRD group). Clinical and laboratory data were compared between two groups. Then a diagnostic model was developed based on the logistic regression analysis.                                                                              Forty-six percent of patients were NDRD including a variety of pathological types. Many differences between DN and NDRD were found by comparison of the clinical indices. In the final logistic regression analysis, only diabetes duration (Dm), systolic blood pressure (Bp), HbA1c (Gh), haematuria (Hu) and diabetic retinopathy (Dr) showed statistical significance. Based on the logistic regression model: pi = e(z)/(1 + e(z)), a diagnostic model was constructed as follows: P(DN) = exp(-13.5922 + 0.0371Dm + 0.0395Bp + 0.3224Gh - 4.4552Hu + 2.9613Dr)/ [1 + exp(-13.5922 + 0.0371Dm + 0.0395Bp + 0.3224Gh - 4.4552Hu + 2.9613Dr)]. P(DN) was the probability of DN diagnosis (P(DN) >   or= 0.5 as DN, P(DN) <    0.5 as NDRD). Validation tests showed that this model had good sensitivity (90%) and specificity (92%).

9482742	"The promoter sequences that contribute to quantitative differences in expression of the petunia genes (rbcS) encoding the small subunit of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase have been characterized. The promoter regions of the two most abundantly expressed petunia rbcS genes, SSU301 and SSU611, show sequence similarity not present in other rbcS genes. We investigated the significance of these and other sequences by adding specific regions from the SSU301 promoter (the most strongly expressed gene) to equivalent regions in the SSU911 promoter (the least strongly expressed gene) and assaying the expression of the fusions in transgenic tobacco plants. In this way, we characterized an SSU301 promoter region (either from -285 to -178 or -291 to -204) which, when added to SSU911, in either orientation, increased SSU911 expression 25-fold. This increase was equivalent to that caused by addition of the entire SSU301 5'-flanking region. Replacement of SSU911 promoter sequences between -198 and the start codon with sequences from the equivalent region of SSU301 did not increase SSU911 expression significantly. The -291 to -204 SSU301 promoter fragment contributes significantly to quantitative differences in expression between the petunia rbcS genes."
9537345	"Red coloration of apple (Malus x domestica) skin is an important determinant of consumer preference and marketability. Anthocyanins are responsible for this coloration, and their accumulation is positively correlated with the expression level of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes. Regulation of expression of these genes is believed to be controlled by MYB transcription factors, and the MYB transcription factors involved in the activation of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes have been isolated in various plants. In the present study, we isolated and characterized a MYB transcription factor gene (MdMYBA) from apple skin. Characterization of MdMYBA demonstrated that (i) MdMYBA expression was specifically regulated depending on the tissue and cultivar/species; (ii) its expression level was much higher in a deep-red cultivar ('Jonathan') than in a pale-red cultivar ('Tsugaru'); (iii) when cauliflower mosaic virus 35S::MdMYBA was introduced into the cotyledons of apple seedlings by means of a transient assay, reddish-purple spots were induced, and MdMYBA also induced anthocyanin accumulation in reproductive tissues of transgenic tobacco; (iv) the expression of MdMYBA was induced by UV-B irradiation and low-temperature treatment, both of which are known to be important in the promotion of anthocyanin accumulation in apple skin; (v) MdMYBA bound specifically to an anthocyanidin synthase (MdANS) promoter region in a gel-shift assay; and (vi) MdMYBA was mapped to the near region of the BC226-STS (a1) marker for the red skin color locus (R(f)). These results suggest that MdMYBA is a key regulatory gene in anthocyanin biosynthesis in apple skin."
7845416	"High levels of 5alpha-reductase activity have been detected in human apocrine glands, and the concentration of dihydrotestosterone has been found to be higher than that of testosterone in the nuclear fraction of the skin of patients who suffer from excessive or abnormal odour derived from apocrine sweat (osmidrosis). Although these results suggest that 5alpha-reductase may play a central role in the action of androgens in the apocrine gland, the isozyme responsible is not known. We therefore assayed 5alpha-reductase type I and type II activity and mRNA expression in isolated apocrine glands from four patients with osmidrosis. When we incubated gland homogenates with [3H]testosterone, we found that the biochemical properties of the apocrine gland enzyme were consistent with those of type I 5alpha-reductase: at substrate concentrations of both 50 nmol/L and 1 micromol/L, the optimum pH was in the range 6.0-7.5, and the apparent Km was 21.1 micromol/L. The apocrine gland enzyme was inhibited by MK386, a specific inhibitor of type I 5alpha-reductase, in a dose-dependent manner, but it was hardly affected by finasteride, a specific inhibitor of type II isozyme, in that a nanomolar concentration of finasteride produced only a slight inhibition. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction showed that the apocrine gland expressed type I 5alpha-reductase mRNA exclusively, except for a faint band of type II isozyme in a few preparations. These data indicate that the type I isozyme is the predominant form of 5alpha-reductase in the apocrine gland and may play a central role in the anabolic activity of androgens, as reported for the sebaceous gland. In addition, a small amount of type II isozyme may be expressed by mesenchymal cells that surround the apocrine glands and also contribute to their development."
2790603	"Fluorescent proteins are extraordinary tools for biology studies due to their versatility; they are used extensively to improve comprehension of plant-microbe interactions. The viral infection process can easily be tracked and imaged in a plant with fluorescent protein-tagged viruses. In plants, fluorescent protein genes are among the most commonly used reporters in transient RNA silencing and heterologous protein expression assays. Fluorescence intensity is used to quantify fluorescent protein accumulation by image analysis or spectroscopy of protein extracts; however, these methods might not be suitable for medium- to large-scale comparisons.                                                                              We report that laser scanners, used routinely in proteomic studies, are suitable for quantitative imaging of plant leaves that express different fluorescent protein pairs. We developed a microtiter plate fluorescence spectroscopy method for direct quantitative comparison of fluorescent protein accumulation in intact leaf discs. We used this technique to measure a fluorescent reporter in a transient RNA silencing suppression assay, and also to monitor early amplification dynamics of a fluorescent protein-labeled potyvirus.                                                                                      Laser scanners allow dual-color fluorescence imaging of leaf samples, which might not be acquired in standard stereomicroscope devices. Fluorescence microtiter plate analysis of intact leaf discs can be used for rapid, accurate quantitative comparison of fluorescent protein accumulation."
4546991	"Glycolic acid chemical peeling is effective for treating comedones, and some clinical data show that it also improves inflammatory eruptions. The purpose of this study was to identify the mechanism of glycolic acid chemical peeling to improve inflammatory acne. To assess growth inhibitory and bactericidal effects of glycolic acid on Propionibacterium acnes in vitro, we used an agar diffusion method and a time-kill method. To reveal bactericidal effects in vivo, we established an agar-attached method which correlated well with the ordinary swab-wash method, and we used the agar-attached method to compare the numbers of propionibacteria on the cheek treated with glycolic acid chemical peeling. Our results show that 30% glycolic acid (at pH 1.5, 3.5 and 5.5) formed growth inhibitory circles in the agar diffusion method, but the diameters of those circles were smaller than with 1% nadifloxacin lotion or 1% clindamycin gel. In the time-kill method, 30% glycolic acid (at pH 1.5 and 3.5) or 1% nadifloxacin lotion reduced the number of P. acnes to less than 100 CFU/mL within 5 min. In contrast, in 30% glycolic acid (at pH 5.5) or in 1% clindamycin gel, P. acnes survived for more than 4 h. Chemical peeling with 35% glycolic acid (at pH 1.2) decreased the number of propionibacteria on the cheeks of patients compared with untreated controls (P <    0.01). Our results demonstrate that glycolic acid has moderate growth inhibitory and bactericidal effects on P. acnes, and that chemical peeling with glycolic acid works on inflammatory acne via those effects."
8929287	"Cyclosporine, a potent immunosuppressant, has nephrotoxic adverse effects that may be mediated by oxidative stress. The reduced form of coenzyme Q10 has antioxidant effects. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of the reduced form of coenzyme Q10 on cyclosporine nephrotoxicity.                                                                                            Six-week-old male Wistar rats were divided into 3 groups (10 animals each). Group 1 (control) received olive oil only. Group 2 received cyclosporine (30 mg/kg/d, which is an experimentally nephrotoxic dose). Group 3 received cyclosporine (30 mg/kg/d) and the reduced form of coenzyme Q10 (600 mg/kg/d). The cyclosporine and the reduced form of coenzyme Q10 were given orally for 4 weeks. Daily urinary albumin excretion, serum creatinine level, and urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine level were measured, and renal tissue was evaluated by immunohistochemistry.                                                                              In rats treated with cyclosporine and the reduced form of coenzyme Q10 (group 3), there were significantly less abnormalities in mean urinary albumin excretion (group 1: 2.8 ± 0.5; group 2: 41 ± 7; group 3: 21 ± 4 μg/d), serum creatinine (group 1: 1.0 ± 0.2; group 2: 1.8 ± 0.4; group 3: 1.4 ± 0.3 mg/dL), and urine 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine levels (group 1: 7 ± 3; group 2: 10 ± 3; group 3: 7 ± 1 mg/mL creatinine) than rats treated with cyclosporine alone (group 2). There were 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine deposits seen in the proximal tubular cells of group 2 that were not present in rats treated with the reduced form of coenzyme Q10 (group 3).                                                                                      The reduced form of coenzyme Q10 may prevent or minimize cyclosporine nephrotoxicity by an antioxidant effect."
8272436	"Anthraquinones of the shikimate-glutarate-mevalonate pathway occur generally in the roots of Galium species. In order to use this chemical character of the genus Galium on the level of polyploid complexes, a chemical analysis has been carried out of anthraquinones which accumulate in the roots of cytologically defined Galium album Mill. (2n = 44). Fractionation of anthraquinone mixtures was performed by applying successive extractions with solvents of the eluotropic sequence and aqueous alkaline solutions of increasing pH. Single anthraquinones were obtained by means of preparative thin-layer chromatography. The identification of ten isolated compounds is described on the basis of chromatographic, chemical and spectroscopical data. Four of the described anthraquinones are new structures."
3441253	"CD1+ antigen-presenting cells in involved epidermis of patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma exhibit and enhanced functional capacity to activate autologous CD4+ T cells compared with CD1+ antigen-presenting cells from uninvolved and normal epidermis. Class II major histocompatibility complex molecules are involved in antigen presentation, and their expression on CD1+ Langerhans cells is known to vary. The expression of all three class II (HLA-DR, -DQ, -DP) molecules was therefore determined on CD1+ epidermal cells from both involved and uninvolved epidermis, using flow cytometry. The involved CD1+ epidermal cells exhibited a 1.5-1.6-fold, statistically significant increase in fluorescence intensity after staining of the class II molecules (HLA-DR, -DQ, -DP) compared with CD1+ epidermal cells from uninvolved epidermis. The autologous CD4+ T cells, activation was almost completely blocked by anti-HLA-DR, and partly by anti-HLA-DQ and anti-HLA-DP. In contrast, an antibody against class I, and an irrelevant control antibody, had no blocking effect. In a pokeweed mitogen assay it was demonstrated that autologous CD4+ T cells, activated by involved epidermal cells, demonstrated suppressor activity rather than helper activity. The suppressor activity was dependent on the presence of HLA-DR-positive epidermal cells. Thus, in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, class II molecules on the individual CD1+ antigen-presenting cell are upregulated in clinically involved compared with uninvolved epidermis, and these molecules are crucially involved in activation of CD4+ T cells."
2730891	"A high-throughput RNA-mediated gene silencing system was developed for Cochliobolus sativus (anamorph: Bipolaris sorokiniana), the causal agent of spot blotch, common root rot and black point in barley and wheat. The green fluorescent protein gene (GFP) and the proteinaceous host-selective toxin gene (ToxA) were first introduced into C. sativus via the polyethylene glycol (PEG)-mediated transformation method. Transformants with a high level of expression of GFP or ToxA were generated. A silencing vector (pSGate1) based on the Gateway cloning system was developed and used to construct RNA interference (RNAi) vectors. Silencing of GFP and ToxA in the transformants was demonstrated by transformation with the RNAi construct expressing hairpin RNA (hpRNA) of the target gene. The polyketide synthase gene (CsPKS1), involved in melanin biosynthesis pathways in C. sativus, was also targeted by transformation with the RNAi vector (pSGate1-CsPKS1) encoding hpRNA of the CsPKS1 gene. The transformants with pSGate1-CsPKS1 exhibited an albino phenotype or reduced melanization, suggesting effective silencing of the endogenous CsPKS1 in C. sativus. Sectors exhibiting the wild-type phenotype of the fungus appeared in some of the CsPKS1-silenced transformants after subcultures as a result of inactivation or deletions of the RNAi transgene. The gene silencing system established provides a useful tool for functional genomics studies in C. sativus and other filamentous fungi."
3515419	"Chalcone synthase (CHS) catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of flavonoids that function in flower pigmentation, protection against stress, and induction of nodulation. The petunia genome contains eight complete chs genes, of which four are differentially expressed in floral tissues and UV-light-induced seedlings. The 5[prime]-flanking regions of these four chs genes were fused to the [beta]-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene and introduced into petunia plants by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. We show that expression of each construct is identical to the expression of the authentic chs gene, implying that the differences in expression pattern between these chs genes are caused at least in part by their promoters. Histochemical analyses of GUS expression show that chs promoters are not only active in pigmented cell types (epidermal cells of the flower corolla and tube and [sub] epidermal cells of the flower stem) but also in a number of unpigmented cell types (mesophylic cells of the corolla, several cell types in the ovary and the seed coat). Comparison of chs-GUS expression and flavonoid accumulation patterns in anthers suggests that intercellular transport of flavonoids and enzymes occurs in this organ. Analysis of the flavonoids accumulated in tissues from mutant lines shows that only a subset of the genes that control flavonoid biosynthesis in the flower operates in the ovary and seed. This implies that (genetic) control of flavonoid biosynthesis is highly tissue specific."
1317163	"Both morphea and lichen sclerosus et atrophicus (LSA) are connective tissue diseases that mainly affect the skin. A recent report suggested that a substantial portion of morphea coexists with LSA. In this report, we describe a case of LSA on the abdomen accompanied by morphea; we employed immunohistochemical staining for periostin as well as MMP-7 and MMP-28, both of which are reported to facilitate fibrosis in the development of various organs, including skin. To our knowledge, this is first English language paper that demonstrates the immunohistochemical staining of periostin, MMP-7 and MMP-28 for morphea and LSA. Our present case might suggest possible mechanisms for the coexistence of two different sclerotic skin disorders."

3736750	"Bioelectrical impedance analysis was introduced more than a decade ago to measure body composition and nutritional status. There are presently limited data on the nutritional status and body composition measured with bioelectrical impedance analysis in renal transplant recipients, especially among the Asian population. The normal values for these data in renal transplant recipients remain unknown.                                                                              All renal transplant recipients with stable graft function who attended the outpatient renal transplant clinic in June 2003 were recruited for this cross-sectional study. Demographic and clinical data were obtained from participating patients and their outpatient clinic notes. Body composition and bioelectrical impedance data were obtained using the Metron BioScan 916 v3 analyzer.                                                                              Out of a total of 168 renal transplant recipients, 110 participated in this study of body composition and bioelectrical impedance for comparison with data from a previous study of 419 normal healthy volunteer controls. When compared to the healthy Malaysians, renal transplant recipients showed similar body composition in terms of body mass index, body cell mass, muscle bulk, percentage of body fat, percentage of fat free mass, and percentage of total body water. However, renal transplant recipients have more extracellular water, a lower phase angle, and a lower reactant.                                                                                     Malaysians who have undergone renal transplantation have similar body composition to the healthy Malaysians when measurements are obtained using bioelectrical impedance analysis."
9330282	"Coronary allograft vasculopathy, a rapidly progressive form of atherosclerosis, remains the limiting factor in the long-term survival of heart transplant recipients. Some centers have attempted percutaneous coronary intervention to slow the disease process and thereby reduce mortality in these patients, but long-term follow-up data are scarce. We compared clinical outcomes in heart transplant recipients with coronary allograft vasculopathy who were treated either with percutaneous coronary intervention or with aggressive medical therapy alone.                                                                              A retrospective analysis of all heart transplant recipients at our institution who underwent surveillance coronary angiography for coronary allograft vasculopathy between 1995 and 2000 was performed. Patients with coronary allograft vasculopathy were stratified according to whether they received medical therapy or percutaneous coronary intervention. Baseline demographics, results of re-vascularization procedures and outcomes were analyzed.                                                                              From 1995 to 2000, 301 patients underwent 602 coronary angiograms. Of the 79 patients who had angiographic evidence of coronary allograft vasculopathy, 53 were treated with aggressive medical therapy, while 26 underwent percutaneous coronary intervention in addition to aggressive medical therapy. At baseline, patients treated with aggressive medical therapy tended to be younger (54.6 +/- 13.8 years) than patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (62.6 +/- 7.6 years; p = 0.0079). Ejection fraction at time of diagnosis of coronary allograft vasculopathy was similar for both groups (medical therapy group, 44.4 +/- 13.4% vs percutaneous coronary intervention group, 47.2 +/- 12.7%; p = 0.38). In our cohort, heart transplant recipients with coronary allograft vasculopathy demonstrated greater mortality than heart transplant recipients without coronary allograft vasculopathy (p = 0.016). Patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention had a 60% re-stenosis rate at 6 months if they were treated with coronary angioplasty and an 18% re-stenosis rate if they received a coronary stent. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed no significant difference in survival in either treatment group at 1 year (80% for medical therapy group vs 95% for percutaneous coronary intervention group) or 3 years (68% for medical therapy group vs 79% for percutaneous coronary intervention group) after the angiographic diagnosis of coronary allograft vasculopathy.                                                                                     In this non-randomized trial, heart transplant recipients with coronary allograft vasculopathy were less likely to survive than patients without it. In addition, we found no statistical difference in mortality in heart transplant recipients with coronary allograft vasculopathy, regardless of whether they received percutaneous coronary intervention or aggressive medical therapy alone."
2585517	"Patients affected by pemphigus vulgaris will occasionally present with associated and characteristic nail changes. This manuscript was prepared as a review of this unique presentation of pemphigus. Articles describing pemphigus vulgaris of the nail were compiled and reviewed and pertinent information was extracted to provide a concise analysis. The literature on this topic is still maturing. Publications to date suggest the incidence of nail and periungal involvement may correlate with the severity of mucocutaneous symptoms and the duration of the disease. The most common nail manifestations reported were acute or chronic paronychia and onychomadesis, and involvement of the fingernails. The nail changes may precede or develop concurrently with the mucocutaneous presentation. The diagnosis can be made by histologic identification and/or by the presence of IgG and C3 with direct immunoflourescence testing. Systemic treatment is required and highly effective; it includes a tailored combination of anti-inflammatory medications, immunosuppressive agents, and/or immunomodulatory treatments. This review aims to provide a better understanding of pemphigus vulgaris nail changes and guidance for clinical treatment. Unknown etiologies, predisposing factors, discrepancies evident in the literature, and limited research warrant further investigation of pemphigus vulgaris of the nail."
3128830	"One of the most important dermatologic diseases from the sociologic viewpoint has been leprosy. Those with leprosy were isolated, excluded from society, and stigmatized. Such a stigma indicates the strong feeling that a leprosy patient is shameful and should not be accepted by society. During the first millennium, leprosy was rapidly inscribed in the system of religious prohibitions-the disease was a punishment by God for wrongdoing, and the disease was associated with the lower spheres of the society. Social perception of leprosy gradually changed during the time of Crusades. The care for lepers became a Christian obligation, and celebrating Holy Masses as for the dead was forsaken. The sick were forced to stay at leprosaria, particularly from the 14th through the 19th centuries when fear of leprosy was at a high point. Admission to a leprosarium was mandatory not only for patients with leprosy but also even those suspected of having the disease."
7285563	A heterozygous mutation in the Langerin gene corresponding to position 837 in the Langerin mRNA was identified in a person deficient in Birbeck granules (BG). This mutation results in an amino acid replacement of tryptophan by arginine at position 264 in the carbohydrate recognition domain of the Langerine protein. Expression of mutated Langerin in human fibroblasts induces tubular-like structures that are negative for BG-specific antibodies and do not resemble the characteristic structural features of BG.
4687740	"Gentiana macrophylla Pall. is a commonly used antirheumatic herb. There are four species of Gentiana recorded as herbal drugs in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. The other species are often marketed as G. macrophylla, and thus the therapeutic effects of G. macrophylla are not achieved. A novel one-step methodology based on real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology has been developed for the identification of G. macrophylla. This relative quantification methodology does not require a known amount of standard, allowing the analysis of many more samples together. The utilization of real-time PCR does not require sample handling, preventing contamination and resulting in much faster and higher throughput results."
7136522	"Cyclosporine (CsA) and MTX are commonly used for GVHD prophylaxis in pediatric allo-SCT. Mucositis and hepatic toxicity frequently restrict the delivery of the fourth dose of MTX. Folinic acid (FA) may ameliorate MTX toxicity. We conducted a retrospective chart review of all pediatric patients who received CsA and MTX for GVHD prophylaxis from January 2000 to July 2010. Patients treated before July 2007 (N=29) did not receive FA and those treated from July 2007 onward did receive FA (N=18). Patients who received FA were significantly more likely to receive day +11 MTX (odds ratio (OR) 10.42, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.21-262.27) but there was no significant difference in Grade III-IV GVHD between the two groups (OR 1.15, 95% CI: 0.08-18.14). FA did not impact relapse-free survival (RFS) (P=0.82). Increased likelihood of receiving day +11 MTX suggests that FA ameliorates MTX toxicity, such as severe mucositis. FA administration for MTX GVHD prophylaxis should be studied in a prospective, randomized fashion."
3532229	"Although homeostasis of rapidly renewing tissues like skin epithelia is maintained by stem cells, the committed progeny of stem cells in the basal layer of epidermis retain regenerative potential and are capable of forming epidermis in response to environmental cues. It is not clear, however, at what point within the epidermal lineage keratinocytes lose this regenerative potential. In this study, we examined the extent of tissue formation by post-mitotic differentiated keratinocytes. We show that cultures of mouse keratinocytes that were, by all measures, differentiated were able to reform a self-renewing, hair-bearing skin when transplanted onto suitable sites in vivo. Genetic labeling and lineage-tracing studies in combination with an involucrin-driven Cre/lox reporter system confirmed that transplanted differentiated keratinocytes were indeed the source of the regenerated skin. More importantly, analysis of early stages of skin regeneration showed hallmarks of dedifferentiation of transplanted differentiated keratinocytes. These data indicate that commitment to differentiation does not prohibit cells from re-entering the cell cycle, de-differentiating, and acquiring ""stemness"". These findings suggest that epidermis can use different strategies for homeostasis and tissue regeneration."
8406421	"This study was conducted to determine whether the inhibition of nitrate reductase activity (NRA; EC 1.6.6.1) in barley (Hordeum vulgare L. var. CM-72) roots by the amino acids (glutamic, aspartic, glutamine and asparagine) is a direct effect or indirect due to inhibition of the NO(3)(-) uptake system. Roots of 8-day-old intact seedlings were supplied with the amino acids (I mM) individually either with NO(3)(-) (0.1 or 10 mM) or roots were pretreated with the amino acids and then supplied with NO(3)(-) only. Nitrate uptake was determined by following NO(3)(-) depletion from the uptake solution containing 0.1 mM NO(3)(-). All the amino acids inhibited the increase in NO(3)(-) uptake similarly (50-60%) when the roots were supplied with 0.1 mM NO(3)(-). Pretreatment with glutamic and aspartic acids was more inhibitory (70-80%) than with glutamine and asparagine (30%). The amino acids partially inhibited (35%) the induction of NRA in roots supplied with 0.1 mM NO(3)(-); however, no inhibition occurred at 10 mM NO(3)(-). Likewise, pretreatment with glutamic or aspartic acid inhibited the induction of NRA at 0.1 mM NO(3)(-) but not at 10 mM NO(3)(-). In contrast, pretreatment with glutamine or asparagine had no effect on the subsequent induction of NRA, even at 0.1 mM NO(3)(-). The results suggest that, at low NO(3)(-) supply, the inhibition of induction of NRA by the amino acids is a result of the lack of substrate availability due to inhibition of the NO(3)(-) uptake system."
2677835	"Effector proteins represent a refined mechanism of bacterial pathogens to overcome plants' innate immune systems. These modular proteins often manipulate host physiology by directly interfering with immune signaling of plant cells. Even if host cells have developed efficient strategies to perceive the presence of pathogenic microbes and to recognize intracellular effector activity, it remains an open question why only few effectors are recognized directly by plant resistance proteins. Based on in-silico genome-wide surveys and a reevaluation of published structural data, we estimated that bacterial effectors of phytopathogens are highly enriched in long-disordered regions (>   50 residues). These structurally flexible segments have no secondary structure under physiological conditions but can fold in a stimulus-dependent manner (e.g., during protein-protein interactions). The high abundance of intrinsic disorder in effectors strongly suggests positive evolutionary selection of this structural feature and highlights the dynamic nature of these proteins. We postulate that such structural flexibility may be essential for (1) effector translocation, (2) evasion of the innate immune system, and (3) host function mimicry. The study of these dynamical regions will greatly complement current structural approaches to understand the molecular mechanisms of these proteins and may help in the prediction of new effectors."
9744623	"When planning implant therapy, knowledge of the bone volume in the implant area is needed to plan and place implants in the most appropriate locations from the prosthetic and surgical perspectives. Commercial software for digital planning of implants in the craniofacial region is not yet available. This article describes a method that enables digital planning of extraoral implants in the mastoid region utilizing commercially available computer-aided design (CAD) software and rapid-prototyping techniques to manufacture a corresponding surgical guide.                                                                                            With the aid of CAD software designed for reverse engineering and three-dimensional animation, digital implant planning based on cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scanning was performed. On the basis of this planning, surgical guides were digitally designed to facilitate the placement of dental implants in the mastoid area. The guides were fabricated using rapid prototyping. The appropriateness of the digitally designed surgical guides for placing extraoral implants was tested on six human cadaver heads with simulated bilateral ear defects. After implant placement, a second CBCT scan was performed to compare preoperative planning with the actual postoperative implant positions.                                                                              Twenty-four implants were placed. The surgical guide helped the surgeon to place the implants at the preoperatively planned positions. Comparison of the CBCT scans revealed that adequate accuracy of implant placement was achieved, both for deviation of the neck (1.56 ± 0.56 mm) and the tip (1.40 ± 0.53 mm) of the implant, and for deviation of the angulation of the implant (0.97 ± 2.33 deg).                                                                                     The presented method for digitally planning extraoral implants in the mastoid area and designing surgical guides allows for placement of implants in the mastoid area in close proximity to the preoperatively planned implant position. The actual implant positions were satisfactory both surgically and prosthetically."
3059852	"The Chlamydomonas reinhardtii genomic DNA database contains a predicted open reading frame (ORF-P) without an apparent stop-codon and unknown coding sequence, located in close proximity and immediately upstream of the TLA1 gene (GenBank Accession No. AF534570). The latter was implicated in the regulation of the light-harvesting chlorophyll antenna size of photosynthesis (Tetali et al. Planta 225:813-829, 2007). To provide currently lacking information on ORF-P and its potential participation in TLA1 gene expression, thus in the regulation of the chlorophyll antenna size, genetic and biochemical analyses were undertaken. The coding and UTR regions of the ORF-P were defined and delineated from those of the adjacent TLA1 gene. ORF-P is shown to encode a protein with a distinct RING-like zinc finger domain that is present in numerous eukaryotic proteins, believed to play a role in cellular ubiquitination, leading to regulation of cellular processes like signaling, growth, transcription, and DNA repair. It is further shown that the two genes share a 74-bp overlap between the 3' UTR region of ORF-P and the 5' UTR region of TLA1. However, they possess distinct start and stop codons and separate coding sequences, and transcribed as separate mRNAs without any trans-splicing between them. Complementation experiments showed that the TLA1 gene alone is sufficient to rescue the truncated chlorophyll antenna size phenotype of the tla1 mutant. Protein sequence alignments in C. reinhardtii and the colorless microalga Polytomella parva suggested that TLA1 defines the relationship between nucleus and organelle in microalgae, indirectly affecting the development of the chlorophyll antenna size."
6430370	"In higher plants, although several genes involved in shoot apical meristem (SAM) formation and organ separation have been isolated, the molecular mechanisms by which they function are largely unknown. CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON (CUC) 1 and CUC2 are examples of two such genes that encode the NAC domain proteins. This study investigated the molecular basis for their activities. Nuclear localization assays indicated that green fluorescent protein (GFP)-CUC proteins accumulate in the nucleus. Yeast one-hybrid and transient expression assays demonstrated that the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the CUC has transactivation activity. Domain-swapping experiments revealed that the functional specificity of the CUC for promoting adventitious shoot formation resides in the highly conserved NAC domain, not in the CTD in which motifs specific to the CUC subfamily are located. Taken together, these observations suggest that CUC proteins transactivate the target genes involved in SAM formation and organ separation through a specific interaction between the NAC domain and the promoter region of the target genes."

1576508	"Using the short-lived isotope (11)C (t(1/2) = 20.4 min) as (11)CO(2), we captured temporal changes in whole-plant carbon movement and partitioning of recently fixed carbon into primary and secondary metabolites in a time course (2, 6, and 24 h) following simulated herbivory with the well-known defense elicitor methyl jasmonate (MeJA) to young leaves of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Both (11)CO(2) fixation and (11)C-photosynthate export from the labeled source leaf increased rapidly (2 h) following MeJA treatment relative to controls, with preferential allocation of radiolabeled resources belowground. At the same time, (11)C-photosynthate remaining in the aboveground sink tissues showed preferential allocation to MeJA-treated, young leaves, where it was incorporated into (11)C-cinnamic acid. By 24 h, resource allocation toward roots returned to control levels, while allocation to the young leaves increased. This corresponded to an increase in invertase activity and the accumulation of phenolic compounds, particularly anthocyanins, in young leaves. Induction of phenolics was suppressed in sucrose transporter mutant plants (suc2-1), indicating that this phenomenon may be controlled, in part, by phloem loading at source leaves. However, when plant roots were chilled to 5°C to disrupt carbon flow between above- and belowground tissues, source leaves failed to allocate resources belowground or toward damaged leaves following wounding and MeJA treatment to young leaves, suggesting that roots may play an integral role in controlling how plants respond defensively aboveground."
8394232	"Pigmented basal cell epithelioma (BCE) arose in the scar of an onchocercoma nodule in a 45-year-old white man. There were extensive fibrosis, inflammation, epidermal hyperplasia, and nests of basal cancer cells. The authors believe that the development of epithelioma in this case was more than a chance occurrence. There is little doubt that the malignant change was subsequent to the scarring-proliferative process of the disease. To the authors' knowledge, this complication has not been reported previously."

The ears and dorsal skin of pigmented hairless mice were treated for 12 d with compounds in ethanol, at equi-optical concentrations, and exposed to subphototoxic doses of ultraviolet A. Increased pigmentation was observed with 6,4,4'-trimethylangelicin >    psoralen >    8-methoxypsoralen >    5-methoxypsoralen >    4,4',5'-trimethylazapsoralen = bergamot oil. Assessment of melanocyte numbers and morphology in epidermal sheet dihydroxyphenylalanine preparations showed that 6,4,4'-trimethylangelicin was the best compound with 536 ear melanocytes/mm2 +/- 15 SEM compared with 46 +/- 4 in controls. Psoralen induced 297/mm2 +/- 33, compared with its methoxy derivatives with ranges between 200 and 240/mm2.6,4,4'-trimethylangelicin had a striking effect on dorsal skin with 462 +/- 18 melanocytes/mm2 compared to less than 80/mm2 in all other ultraviolet A treatment groups. Khellin, 5-GOP and ultraviolet A only and all non-ultraviolet A controls had no effect. Melanogenesis was associated with increased dendricity, melanocyte size, especially with 5-methoxypsoralen, and giant melanocytes were noted with some treatments. The potency of 6,4,4'-trimethylangelicin, which does not form DNA interstrand crosslinks, may be related to its high DNA binding constant. Our data may be useful in the selection of compounds to treat vitiligo."
1818630	"We isolated the cortical microtubules (CMTs) from tobacco BY-2 cells to identify their components. By centrifugation of protoplasts homogenized in the presence of taxol, a MT-stabilizing reagent, in a density gradient of Percoll, we obtained membranous vesicles to which MTs forming a sheet-like bundle were attached. Rhodamine-conjugated Ricinus communis agglutinin I (RCA-I), a lectin that bound to the surface of protoplasts, stained these vesicles, indicating that they were plasma membrane (PM) vesicles that retained CMTs. CMTs were released by solubilization of PM vesicles with Triton X-100. A sheet-like array of CMTs was retained even after solubilization of PM vesicles. Immunoblot analysis of the isolated CMTs demonstrated the presence of tubulin, actin, the 65 kDa microtubule-associated protein (MAP) and a 130 kDa RCA-I binding protein. Purification of the isolated CMTs by the temperature dependent disassembly-reassembly cycling method revealed four polypeptides, 190, 120, 85 and 65 kDa, co-assembling with CMTs."
8735237	"The homing of hematopoietic precursor cells (HPC) within the bone marrow is most likely to be mediated by specific adhesion via surface receptors to cellular and extracellular matrix (ECM) components and to be regulated by cytokines. We investigated the effects of serum and cytokines on the expression of adhesion molecules on cryopreserved and fresh peripheral blood-derived progenitor cells (PBPC) and on the adhesion of PBPC to various ECM proteins. PBPC were collected from patients by leukapheresis during G-CSF-supported recovery from conventional cancer chemotherapy. Freezing markedly reduced the fraction of CD34+ cells with L-selectin (CD62L) expression from 62 to 11% and also diminished the fluorescence intensity for the integrin subunits CD29 and CD49d on CD34+ cells. A 14 h incubation of thawed PBPC with serum induced re-expression of adhesion molecules. The addition of the cytokine cocktails (G-CSF + SCF + IL-3 + IL-11 or IL-4 + IL-1beta + IFN-gamma) or MGDF, however, exerted no effects in addition to serum alone. Furthermore, when compared to serum alone, the addition of cytokine cocktails or MGDF did not alter the fraction of fresh PB-CD34+ cells adhering to collagen I, collagen IV, fibronectin, laminin or vitronectin. HPC adhesion to ECM components might be refractory to short-term alterations of the cytokine environment. Alternatively, longer incubation times or other cytokines may be necessary to modulate the expression of adhesion molecules on hematopoietic progenitor cells or adhesion itself under ex vivo conditions."
2420702	"The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between interleukin 4 (IL4) polymorphisms/haplotypes and dental implant loss.                                                                                            Two hundred and seventy eight (n = 278) unrelated patients were divided into 2 groups: (1) control group (C) composed of 186 individuals presenting at least 1 osseointegrated implant and (2) study group (S) composed of 94 individuals presenting at least 1 implant loss. After DNA collection, IL4 polymorphisms were investigated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism and for the variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) only by PCR.                                                                              No association between alleles/genotypes of -590 (C/T) (P = 0.9704/P = 0.5992) and VNTR (P = 0.7155/P = 0.8789) polymorphisms and implant loss were found between the groups. Regarding +33 (C/T) polymorphism, no difference was found in genotype frequency (P = 0.1288), but the C allele was associated with implant loss (P = 0.0236, odds ratio = 1.61, 95% confidence interval = 1.1-2.4). Haplotype analysis showed no statistical differences between the groups.                                                                                     The C allele of the +33 (C/T) polymorphism in the IL4 gene was associated with susceptibility to dental implant loss in Brazilians in the studied population."
9476947	"Venous malformations are common vascular anomalies which only occur sporadically.                                                                                  We present a series of 25 patients with extratruncular venous malformations of the skin or the neighboring mucosa that are arranged in a segmental pattern.                                                                              All lesions were sporadic and mostly unilateral. According to the extent of the vascular malformation, two subgroups were defined: large- to medium-sized and small localized lesions ('acrofacial distribution'). In large- or medium-sized lesions, we noted a strict midline separation of the disorder. Thus, we assume that this segmental arrangement reflects genetic mosaicism.                                                                                      This type of venous malformation originates from a postzygotic mutation that occurs at an early developmental stage. Hence, the type of vascular disorder present in our 25 patients seems to fulfil each criterion of the term 'nevus'. This vascular nevus should be distinguished from other forms of venous malformations such as the varicose veins associated with the Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome, the dermal nodules of the blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome and the vascular skin lesions of the Maffucci syndrome. Thus, we propose the new term 'venous nevus' or 'nevus venosus'."
3313267	"The aim of this study was to evaluate, with a new gas flow technique, leakage at the implant/abutment junction in systems with four different connections.                                                                                            Five Branemark System, five One Morse, five Intra-lock System, and five Ankylos Plus implants and abutments were used. A hole was drilled in the apex of each implant to allow gas to flow through the connection from negative to atmospheric pressure. The gas flow was calculated (slope of pressure decrease, in hPa.s-1). Each connection was tested after both manual and key tightening. Statistical analysis was performed on a generalized linear model with repeated measurements. The significance level was set at α=.05.                                                                              A global significant difference was observed between the various systems (P=.0001). After manual tightening, gas leakage was (Ln[hPa.s-1], means±standard deviations): One Morse: 0.20 (±1.70); Branemark System: -4.56 (±2.61); Intra-lock: -4.31 (±4.17); Ankylos Plus; -7.59 (±0.76). After key tightening, mean values were: One Morse: -2.51 (±2.72); Branemark System: -7.23 (±1.01); Intra-lock: -7.76 (±0.50); Ankylos Plus; -7.73 (±0.62).                                                                                     This study confirms that gas flow is an appropriate method to assess connection leakage. Ankylos Plus connection leakage was very low when the assembly was tightened manually. Among conical connection systems, low (Ankylos Plus) and high (One Morse) leakage was observed. This gas flow study suggests, therefore, that connection design is not the most important parameter for implant/abutment connection leakage."
4104366	We report a case in which en bloc kidneys with bilateral double ureters from a 5-month-old donor were successfully transplanted into a 25-year-old recipient. No stents were used. There were no complications after the transplant. The patient remains well at more than 1.5 years post-transplantation with serum creatinine 1.2 mg/dl.
5312729	"In the past 7 years we have extensively studied an uncommon hypopigmented disorder that, apart from hypopigmentation, showed many common features with parapsoriasis en plaque (PSEP), both clinically and histopathologically.                                                                                  We sought to verify whether this disorder should be considered a hypopigmented variant of PSEP and thus be referred to as hypopigmented PSEP.                                                                              A total of 34 patients presenting with this peculiar hypopigmented disorder were included (2003-2010). Patients were subjected to a predesigned algorithm excluding all possible differential diagnoses of hypopigmented lesions.                                                                              Our findings indicated that this disorder can be diagnosed as hypopigmented PSEP. These findings included: (1) exclusion of all other disorders causing similar hypopigmented lesions; (2) shape and size of the lesions being very similar to those of classic small PSEP (small-plaque parapsoriasis [SPP]); (3) similar distribution of the lesions (trunk, proximal upper and lower limbs) to the classic PSEP; (4) digitiform extensions of most the lesions (70.5% of our patients) as in SPP; (5) absence of itching as in PSEP (SPP type); (6) good response to narrowband ultraviolet B in 76.4% of the patients (n = 26); and (7) during follow-up 5 patients (14.7%) converted into hypopigmentd mycosis fungoides.                                                                                      A limitation in our study is that we did not perform clonal T-cell receptor gene rearrangement because of limited resources.                                                                                     Based on our findings we believe that this hypopigmented disorder is a well-defined new variant of the PSEP family that shows, apart from the hypopigmentation, all the features of PSEP, particularly the SPP variant, and accordingly could be referred to as hypopigmented PSEP."
8311148	A 12-year-old boy with common variable immunodeficiency (CVI) who developed severe alopecia is presented. His sister also had alopecia and recurrent infections and died of lung infection at the age of 7 years. The loss of hair in both children was total; the pathology of a scalp skin biopsy specimen was typical for alopecia areata. The boy was subjected to clinical and immunologic evaluation and the results were compatible with common variable immunodeficiency.
2271521	"Aquatic nodulation on the tropical legume Sesbania rostrata occurs at lateral root bases via intercellular crack-entry invasion. A gene was identified (Srprx1) that is transiently up-regulated during the nodulation process and codes for a functional class III plant peroxidase. The expression strictly depended on bacterial nodulation factors (NFs) and could be modulated by hydrogen peroxide, a downstream signal for crack-entry invasion. Expression was not induced after wounding or pathogen attack, indicating that the peroxidase is a symbiosis-specific isoform. In situ hybridization showed Srprx1 transcripts around bacterial infection pockets and infection threads until they reached the central tissue of the nodule. A root nodule extensin (SrRNE1) colocalized with Srprx1 both in time and space and had the same NF requirement, suggesting a function in a similar process. Finally, in mixed inoculation nodules that were invaded by NF-deficient bacteria and differed in infection thread progression, infection-associated peroxidase transcripts were not observed. Lack of Srprx1 gene expression could be one of the causes for the aberrant structure of the infection threads."
7306915	"The blood flow rate in subcutaneous adipose tissue was measured on the lower legs of 11 patients with chronic lower-leg venous insufficiency and ulceration and in eight age-matched control subjects for 12-20 h, under ambulatory conditions, using the 133Xe wash-out technique with portable Cadmium telluride (CdTe(Cl)) detectors. In both groups, the change from an upright to a supine position at the beginning of the night period elicited an instantaneous increment in the blood flow rate of 30-40% with a decrease in the central and local postural sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity. After approximately 1 h of sleep, a considerable increase in blood flow rate was seen in both patient and control groups which persisted for nearly 100 min. In the patient group, the mean increase was 137% compared to a mean increase of 68% in the control group (P less than 0.01). The blood flow then returned to the same level as at the beginning of the night and remained stable until the subjects woke in the morning. The differences between this nocturnal hyperaemic phase and the adjacent phases were highly significant in both groups (P less than 0.0001 and P less than 0.005, respectively). The blood flow levels measured on the second day were of the same magnitude as those registered on the first day. The mean values of the wash-out rate constants (k) of the two groups were of the same magnitude in all phases of subcutaneous blood flow level, except in the hyperaemic phase, where it was significantly higher in the patient group (P less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
8771867	"The use of expanded criteria donors (ECDs) is still limited because of inferior graft survival compared to standard criteria donors (SCDs). We assessed the impact of immediate graft function (IGF) on renal graft survival among recipients of SCD and ECD grafts to determine whether these kidneys performed equally well under ""ideal"" conditions favoring IGF.                                                                              We included all cadaveric renal transplants performed from 1990 to 2002 (n = 335). Delayed graft function (DGF) was defined as the need for dialysis in the first 7 days posttransplant. Slow graft function (SGF) and IGF were defined as a serum creatinine fall by <   20% versus >   20% in the first 24 hours posttransplant, respectively. Non-death censored actual graft survivals are reported herein.                                                                              Seventy-two of the 335 subjects (21.5%) received organs from ECDs and displayed IGF in 54.7%, SGF 16.2%, and DGF 29.1%. Among SCDs, the SGF and DGF rates were 15.3% and 23.4%, respectively. In ECD, the SGF and DGF rates were 19.4% and 50% (P <    .02). Actual graft survivals at 1 and 5 years was 86.3% and 70.4%, respectively. Patients with IGF had higher actual graft survival at 5 years compared to SGF and DGF (83.5% vs 74.1% vs 45.4%). DGF had an equally bad impact on actual 5-year graft survival in SCDs and ECDs (42.6% vs 50%).                                                                                     DGF has a strong detrimental impact on 5-year graft survival. There is a higher rate of DGF in ECD versus SCD kidneys. The detrimental impact on 5-year actual graft survival is equal in SCD and ECD kidneys. Minimizing DGF should be our goal."
3207880	"In contrast to phytochrome-, cryptochrome- and phototropin-sensing systems, about which considerable knowledge has accumulated, the ultraviolet-B (UVB) photoreceptor is not yet known at the molecular level. Information about the downstream signalling events that underlie UVB-provoked physiological responses is limited. Recent whole-genome transcript profiling, isolation of mutants that are impaired in specific UVB-induced responses and detailed photobiological studies suggest that responses that are triggered by shorter wavelength UVB and longer wavelength UVB are mediated by two different sensory systems. The bZIP transcription factor HY5 was recently identified as an important player in the long-wavelength UVB-induced signal transduction cascade. Advances in the development of luciferase-reporter lines will make it feasible to perform high-throughput genetic screens to isolate novel mutants that are impaired in sensing or transducing signals downstream of the putative UVB photoreceptor(s)."
5615130	"Leprosy and vitiligo are common affections in the West Indies. Vitiligo frequently occurs in lepromatous patients, an observation rarely reported in the literature.                                                                              We studied the prevalence of vitiligo in patients affected by leprosy by performing a retrospective study between 1978 and 1999 in the French West Indies (Martinique).                                                                              Eleven patients presented with vitiligo among 101 with lepromatous (multibacillary) leprosy. None presented with vitiligo among the 364 with the tuberculoid (paucibacillary) form. The mean age of the vitiligo patients was 55. 4 years at vitiligo onset. The sex ratio was 0.8. Vitiligo occurred 19 years after the diagnosis of leprosy, with a range from 3 to 42 years. The prevalence of vitiligo in lepromatous patients was 10.9%, compared to 0% in tuberculoid patients. Such an increase in prevalence compared with that in the general population (0.34%) was shown to be highly significant (P<    0.0001).                                                                                      Our data confirmed that the association of vitiligo and leprosy was not fortuitous. The physiopathology leading to this high rate of vitiligo in lepromatous leprosy is unclear, despite the fact that autoimmunity plays a major role in both diseases."
3129857	"Fecal incontinence (FI) remains a socially isolating condition with profound impact on quality of life for which autologous myoblast cell therapy represents an attractive treatment option. We developed an animal model of FI and investigated the possibility of improving sphincter function by intrasphincteric injection of syngeneic myoblasts. Several types of anal cryoinjuries were evaluated on anesthetized Fischer rats receiving analgesics. The minimal lesion yielding sustainable anal sphincter deficiency was a 90° cryoinjury of the sphincter, repeated after a 24-h interval. Anal sphincter pressure was evaluated longitudinally by anorectal manometry under local electrostimulation. Myoblasts were prepared using a protocol mimicking a clinical-grade process and further transduced with a GFP-encoding lentiviral vector before intrasphincteric injection. Experimental groups were uninjured controls, cryoinjured + PBS, and cryoinjured + myoblasts (different doses or injection site). Myoblast injection was well tolerated. Transferred myoblasts expressing GFP integrated into the sphincter and differentiated in situ into dystrophin-positive mature myofibers. Posttreatment sphincter pressures increased over time. At day 60, pressures in the treated group were significantly higher than those of PBS-injected controls and not significantly different from those of normal rats. Longitudinal follow-up showed stability of the therapeutic effect on sphincter function over a period of 6 months. Intrasphincteric myoblast injections at the lesion borders were equally as effective as intralesion administration, but an injection opposite to the lesion was not. These results provide proof of principle for myoblast cell therapy to treat FI in a rat model. This strategy is currently being evaluated in humans in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial."
3988490	"We successfully implemented virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) in barley (Hordeum vulgare) for the functional characterization of genes required for Mla13-mediated resistance toward the biotrophic barley pathogen Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei. Initially, barley cultivars were screened for their ability to host the barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV)-VIGS vector by allowing its replication and systemic movement without causing excessive symptoms. Phytoene desaturase silencing leading to photobleaching was used as a phenotypic marker alongside reverse transcription-PCR data to characterize the silencing response at the molecular level. Barley cultivar Clansman, harboring the Mla13 resistance gene, was chosen as the most suitable host for BSMV-VIGS-based functional characterization of Rar1, Sgt1, and Hsp90 in the Mla-mediated resistance toward powdery mildew. BSMV-induced gene silencing of these candidate genes, which are associated in many but not all race-specific pathways, proved to be robust and could be detected at both mRNA and protein levels for up to 21 d postinoculation. Systemic silencing was observed not only in the newly developed leaves from the main stem but also in axillary shoots. By examining fungal development from an incompatible mildew strain carrying the cognate Avr13 gene on plants BSMV silenced for Rar1, Sgt1, and Hsp90, a resistance-breaking phenotype was observed, while plants infected with BSMV control constructs remained resistant. We demonstrate that Hsp90 is a required component for Mla13-mediated race-specific resistance and that BSMV-induced VIGS is a powerful tool to characterize genes involved in pathogen resistance in barley."
8780152	"Inactivation of a plastid located quinone-oxygen oxidoreductase gene in the immutans Arabidopsis mutant leads to a photobleached phenotype because of a lack of photoprotective carotenoids. Inactivation of the corresponding gene in the ghost tomato mutant leads to a similar phenotype in leaves and to carotenoid deficiency in petals and ripe fruits. This plastid terminal oxidase (the first to be cloned and biochemically characterized) resembles the mitochondrial cyanide-insensitive alternative oxidase. Here, we propose a model integrating this novel oxidase as a component of an electron transport chain associated to carotenoid desaturation, as well as to a respiratory activity within plastids."

7610790	"Cutaneous manifestations of avian mite bites are not well recognized by physicians or patients. Clinical signs and symptoms are usually caused by bites from avian mites that have infested domestic poultry or birds nesting in or near human habitation. This report details 2 cases of pruritic papules acquired from avian mites that had infested pet gerbils and reviews the dermatologic literature about avian mites.                                                                                   An 11-year-old boy and an unrelated 10-year-old girl each had mysterious, pruritic papules for many months before their pet gerbils were found to be infested with Ornithonyssus sylviarum (the northern fowl mite) and Dermanyssus gallinae (the chicken mite), respectively. Symptoms resolved when the gerbils were removed from the home.                                                                                      Because infestation of pet gerbils with avian mites has never been reported, cases of avian mite bites and dermatitis may have gone unrecognized or misdiagnosed. Inquiry about ownership of pet gerbils may be helpful in patients with mysterious bites."
8153429	A retrospective study was carried out to investigate possible reasons for a marked increase in fusidic acid-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (FusR S. aureus) identified by our routine hospital microbiology service. Information was obtained on a sample of 64 consecutive patients from whom resistant S. aureus had been cultured. The source of isolates was found to be diffuse within the hospital and community. The site of sample was most frequently chronic cutaneous infections (68%). All the S. aureus isolates were resistant to both fusidic acid and penicillin and many were resistant to multiple antibiotics. Topical fusidic acid had been used by 40% of patients in the preceding 6 months and none had received oral fusidic acid (sodium fusidate). Most (80%) had received an oral antibiotic in the preceding 2 years. Information from the Prescriptions Pricing Authority revealed that the total number of prescriptions for fusidic acid-containing preparations for the period September 1997 to August 1998 was markedly higher in Harrogate than in five other local areas where increases in (FusR) S. aureus have not been observed.
2005567	"Staurosporine, a protein kinase (PK) inhibitor, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), a PKC activator and A23187 calcium ionophore were added to human melanocyte cultures with or without dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dbcAMP). After 2 days' incubation, changes in various melanogenic factors were examined such as tyrosinase activity and the amount of tyrosinase-related protein (TRP) as well as the morphology of the melanocytes. dbcAMP stimulated all the melanogenic factors. Staurosporine increased tyrosinase activity and amount of TRP and caused morphological changes with the formation of numerous dendrites, regardless of the presence of dbcAMP. In contrast, PMA did not significantly affect tyrosinase activity, TRP content or dendrite formation, with or without dbcAMP. The effects of staurosporine on tyrosinase activity and TRP content were completely inhibited by PMA, but PMA did not significantly affect the staurosporine-induced morphological changes. A23187 inhibited both tyrosinase activity and TRP content, regardless of the presence of dbcAMP, but did not affect the morphology of melanocytes. These findings suggest that tyrosinase activity and TRP content are regulated by adenylate cyclase and Ca2+ and partly by PKC, while the morphological features of melanocytes are affected by intracellular cAMP accumulation and by the inhibition of PKC."
2295057	"Measures of quality of life (QOL) and patient satisfaction are of great importance in dermatology, as both impact upon treatment adherence and health outcomes. Patients' assessment of QOL often differs from their doctors' predictions and their assessments of skin disease severity do not correlate with patients' own perceptions. The development of laser technology has facilitated successful treatment of many skin conditions, but studies on patient satisfaction are lacking.                                                                                   Our aim was to determine the extent of discordance between patient and dermatologist-assessed disease severity and assess the impact of acne scarring, rosacea and photoaging on QOL. Our secondary aim was to assess patient satisfaction with laser therapy.                                                                              A prospective study of patients undergoing laser treatment for acne scarring, rosacea and photoaging was conducted over 1 year at the Skin &     Cancer Foundation Australia. Subjective disease severity was determined using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Two dermatologists determined objective severity using validated grading scales to score photographs. QOL impact was measured by Skindex-16, satisfaction was measured using an amended Comprehensive Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ-18).                                                                              A total of 147 individuals sought laser therapy for acne scarring, rosacea and photoaging. Dermatologists' subjective disease severity correlated weakly with patient-reported severity. All conditions negatively impacted upon QOL. Patients with rosacea had the most symptomatic impact; acne scarring was associated with the greatest self-esteem and social functioning issues; photoaging patients were the least affected. There were significant correlations between subjective severity assessment and Skindex-16 scores. There was notable discordance between dermatologist's skin severity assessment and patient's self-reported QOL impact.                                                                                     Skin conditions can have a profound impact on patient QOL, which is affected by patients' perception of disease severity and not fully appreciated by dermatologists' own severity assessments. Laser therapy is associated with high patient satisfaction."

The patients had no other cutaneous metastatic lesions. Two of the patients died within two years of the appearance of the penile nodules, but the lesions in the third patient, followed up for one year to date, responded to intravenously administered mitomycin."
8881625	"The aim of this study was to examine the wear behavior of conical crowns with electroplated gold copings that are used to connect implants and teeth to a removable denture. Gold alloy and zirconium dioxide ceramic crowns were compared.                                                                                            Fifteen crowns each were milled for two groups: gold alloy and zirconium dioxide. Each specimen had a 2-degree taper. The electroplated coping was established by direct electroforming. The retentive forces and the correlating distance during insertion and separation were measured after 10,000 wear cycles were applied. The wear testing was separated into a start phase, an initial wear phase, and the long-term wear period. The retention force value and the force-distance integral of the first 0.3 mm of each cycle were calculated.                                                                              The changes in retention force and integral did not differ significantly between both groups in the start and the initial wear phase. No differences were seen in force development during the long-term wear period. Only the force-distance integral showed a significant difference: the median values of the gold crowns increased slightly, and they decreased slightly for the zirconia crowns. The median force values never fell below 6 N for gold and 4 N for zirconia.                                                                                      Within the limitations of this study, the tested conical crowns showed clinically acceptable retentive properties. As with other retentive elements for dentures, the specimens tested showed the greatest amount of change in retentive forces during the first 2,000 cycles. The development of retention force in both groups was not significantly different. However, the zirconia specimens showed reduced variability, which is preferable in clinical practice."
1011053	"Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a component of the innate immune system that binds the surface of pathogens, activating the complement pathway and acting as opsonin. Certain single-nucleotide polymorphisms of MBL2 are associated with a decrease in the circulating levels of MBL. Our aim was to evaluate the influence of MBL2 polymorphisms in the invasiveness of Cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease after solid organ transplantation.                                                                              We include those solid organ transplant recipients who developed CMV disease posttransplant from 2000 to 2006. MBL2 genotyping was performed by sequencing of exon 1 (wild-type allele A and variants B, C, and D) and promoter regions (alleles H and L, X and Y, and P and Q). In the case of liver transplantation, donor MBL2 genotypes were analyzed. Associations were calculated by the chi-square test and binary logistic regression.                                                                              We included 45 transplant recipients with CMV disease (22 renal, 7 simultaneous kidney-pancreas, 11 liver, and 5 heart), of whom 10 (22%) had invasive CMV disease. No differences were found regarding HH (versus HL or LL), YY and YX (versus XX) and QQ (versus QP and PP) haplotypes with invasive CMV disease (P = 1.000 for all 3 comparisons). Patients with an exon 1 wild-type (AA) haplotype had 36% invasive CMV disease in comparison with 9% of patients with A/O or O/O haplotypes (P = .035). Binary logistic regression analysis showed that patients with exon 1 AA haplotype had an independent risk of developing invasive CMV disease (odds ratio, 6.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-32.5).                                                                                      Our results suggest that exon 1 wild-type genotypes are associated with a higher risk of invasive CMV disease after solid organ transplantation."
6683604	"Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are important antioxidant enzymes that catalyze the disproportionation of superoxide anion to oxygen and hydrogen peroxide to guard cells against superoxide toxicity. The major pathway for activation of copper/zinc SOD (CSD) involves a copper chaperone for SOD (CCS) and an additional minor CCS-independent pathway reported in mammals. We characterized the CCS-dependent and -independent activation pathways for three CSDs localized in different cellular compartments in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). The main activation pathway for CSD1 in the cytoplasm involved a CCS-dependent and -independent pathway, which was similar to that for human CSD. Activation of CSD2 in chloroplasts depended totally on CCS, similar to yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) CSD. Peroxisome-localized CSD3 via a CCS-independent pathway was similar to nematode (Caenorhabditis elegans) CSD in retaining activity in the absence of CCS. In Arabidopsis, glutathione played a role in CCS-independent activation, as was reported in humans, but an additional factor was required. These findings reveal a highly specific and sophisticated regulation of CSD activation pathways in planta relative to other known CCS-independent activation."
6004293	"Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is a severe hereditary mechanobullous disease resulting from mutations in the COL7A1 gene, coding for type VII collagen. Patients with RDEB tend to develop squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) at sites of chronic ulceration or scarring on the whole body. Distinguishing SCC from benign hyperkeratotic lesions is often difficult, not only clinically but also histologically in patients with RDEB. We investigated several matrix metallopeptidase (MMP) subtypes by comparing the DNA amplification microarray findings between evident SCCs and benign hyperkeratotic lesions in the same patient with RDEB. We report that MMP13 was found to be strongly positive in SCCs but negative in benign hyperkeratotic lesions. We found that there is an evident difference in the transitional area between SCCs and benign hyperkeratotic lesions. We propose that MMP13 may be a useful differentiating marker between SCC and benign hyperkeratotic lesions in RDEB."
7934218	"Androgenetic alopecia (AGA), or pattern hair loss, is a common disorder in both Asian men and women. There are several guidelines for the treatment of AGA which are suitable for Caucasian patients; however, each of these has some limitations. Furthermore, in comparison with Caucasian patients, Asian patients with AGA have different types of hair loss and family histories which may alter the treatment response. There is currently no published AGA guideline for Asian patients.                                                                                   The Asian Consensus Committee for Androgenetic Alopecia aimed to develop an algorithmic guideline, based on the basic and specific (BASP) classification, for the treatment of AGA especially in Asian patients.                                                                              The committee collaborated extensively on reviewing available literature on AGA treatment in order to formulate an algorithmic guideline on AGA management.                                                                              Previously published guidelines based on pre-existing classifications of AGA cannot easily classify the patterns of AGA that are more frequently seen in Asians. The BASP classification not only facilitates the development of a unified and simplified algorithm, but also overcomes the disadvantages of previously reported classification systems.                                                                                      The proposed treatment guideline for AGA based on the BASP classification may be useful for dermatologists in their approach to treating Asian patients with AGA in clinical practice. Ideally, clinicians should try to utilize this guideline consistently in their practice to monitor treatment response with the goal of enhancing successful outcomes. This will help boost patients' confidence and self-esteem, thus improving patient' compliance with the prescribed treatments."
6140451	"Patients with end-stage renal failure undergoing haemodialysis (HD) are exposed to oxidative stress. Increased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) were demonstrated in plasma of uraemic patients, indicating accelerated lipid peroxidation (LPO) as a consequence of multiple pathogenetic factors. The aim of our investigation was to examine the role of renal anaemia in oxidative stress in HD patients.                                                                              MDA and 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) were measured in three groups of patients undergoing HD: group I comprised eight patients with a blood haemoglobin (Hb) <    10 g/dl (mean Hb = 8.1+/-1.3 g/dl), and group II were eight patients with a Hb >    10 g/dl (mean Hb=12.4+/-1.9g/dl); none of these 16 patients had been treated with human recombinant erythropoietin (rHuEpo). Group III comprised 27 patients with a mean Hb of 10.5+/-1.6 g/dl after long-term rHuEpo treatment.                                                                              Mean plasma concentrations of both MDA and HNE were significantly higher (P<   0.0001) in all 43 HD patients than in 20 healthy controls (MDA 2.85+/-0.25 vs 0.37+/-0.03 microM, HNE 0.32+/-0.03 vs 0.10+/-0.01 microM). Comparing the three groups, it was shown that HD patients with a Hb <   10 g/dl had significantly higher plasma levels of LPO products (MDA 3.81+/-0.86 microM, HNE 0.45+/-0.07 microM) than HD patients with a Hb >   10g/dl (MDA 2.77+/-0.58 UM, HNE 0.25+/-0.05 microM), and than HD patients treated with rHuEpo (MDA 2.50+/-0.12 microM, HNE 0.29+/-0.03 microM). Furthermore, an inverse correlation between plasma concentration of LPO products and haemoglobin levels was seen (r=0.62, P<   0.0001).                                                                                     Radical generation in HD patients might be caused in part by renal anemia itself. Treatment with rHuEpo may decrease radical generation effectively in HD patients due to the increase in the number of red blood cells and blood haemoglobin concentration."
2665251	"The polyphenolic products of the phenylpropanoid pathway, including proanthocyanidins, anthocyanins and flavonols, possess antioxidant properties that may provide health benefits. To investigate the genetic architecture of control of their biosynthesis in apple fruit, various polyphenolic compounds were quantified in progeny from a 'Royal Gala' × 'Braeburn' apple population segregating for antioxidant content, using ultra high performance liquid chromatography of extracts derived from fruit cortex and skin.                                                                              Construction of genetic maps for 'Royal Gala' and 'Braeburn' enabled detection of 79 quantitative trait loci (QTL) for content of 17 fruit polyphenolic compounds. Seven QTL clusters were stable across two years of harvest and included QTLs for content of flavanols, flavonols, anthocyanins and hydroxycinnamic acids. Alignment of the parental genetic maps with the apple whole genome sequence in silico enabled screening for co-segregation with the QTLs of a range of candidate genes coding for enzymes in the polyphenolic biosynthetic pathway. This co-location was confirmed by genetic mapping of markers derived from the gene sequences. Leucoanthocyanidin reductase (LAR1) co-located with a QTL cluster for the fruit flavanols catechin, epicatechin, procyanidin dimer and five unknown procyanidin oligomers identified near the top of linkage group (LG) 16, while hydroxy cinnamate/quinate transferase (HCT/HQT) co-located with a QTL for chlorogenic acid concentration mapping near the bottom of LG 17.                                                                                     We conclude that LAR1 and HCT/HQT are likely to influence the concentration of these compounds in apple fruit and provide useful allele-specific markers for marker assisted selection of trees bearing fruit with healthy attributes."
5082045	"The elastic modulus is determined as a function of water content for untreated stratum corneum, and stratum corneum treated with urea and LiBr. The modulus is also determined for stratum corneum at temperatures from 2 degrees C to 45 degrees C and on samples with the water solubles extracted. The modulus is independent of temperature, but may be modified by binding of small molecules to the protein in stratum corneum. The modulus is found to be a function of water content, not water activity."
3220591	"From April, 1980 to November, 1988, 163 one or two haplotype-mismatch living related (LR) or living unrelated (LUR) potential renal transplant recipients received three 200 ml aliquots of donor specific transfusion (DST) at biweekly intervals with concomitant azathioprine (2 mg/kg/day). Following transplantation, only prednisone and azathioprine were given for immunosuppression. The results for the DST group are compared with those for HLA identical living recipients (57 patients) transplanted during this same interval (1980-1988). Comparison is also made with a group of one or two haplotype-mismatched living donor recipients (54 patients) not treated with DST but with triple drug therapy (prednisone, azathioprine, cyclosporine) and antithymocyte globulin (ATG) or OKT-3 induction. Permanent T cell crossmatch sensitization occurred in 11 of 163 patients (7%). Successful DST donor transplants were performed between 121 one HLA haplotype-mismatched, 14 two HLA haplotype-mismatched LR, and 7 two haplotype-mismatched LUR pairs. Actual one- and five-year graft survivals were 94%, 100%, 100%, and 72%, 85%, and 71%, respectively, for these three subgroups of DST treated patients. The graft survival for all DST pretreated recipients at one, five, and ten years was comparable to the HLA-identical group (94%, 79%, 64% vs. 91%, 80% and 77%). At a mean follow-up of 10 1/2 years, 54% (80 patients) of the entire group of 147 patients transplanted after DST have functioning transplants with a mean serum creatinine of 1.7 mg/dl. Fifteen percent of DST patients (21 patients) died with a functioning graft 2 to 132 months after transplantation, 26% (37 patients) rejected the DST graft after 1 to 128 months, and 6% (9 patients) were lost for nonimmunological reasons. No lymphoproliferative disease developed in the DST group and the incidence of cytomegalovirus sepsis was only 2% (3 patients). The long-term beneficial effects of DST on renal allograft survival and function and the lower incidence of the complications of nonspecific immunosuppression should encourage increased utilization of DST in renal transplantation."
2011986	"Intradermal or skin-graft sensitization always results in accelerated rejection of subsequent MHC-disparate mouse heart transplants; intravenous or intrasplenic sensitization almost always results in prolonged survival. The survival time after intraperitoneal sensitization is unpredictable: hyperacute or accelerated rejection, as well as normal or prolonged survival, occurs suggestive of a delicate balance between suppressive and rejecting immune responses. We have observed a positive correlation between transplant survival and the distribution of 51Cr-labeled antigenic cells early after i.v., i.d., i.p., and intrasplenic injection. Label recovery from the viscera was already high 2 hr after i.v. injection, while after i.d. injection virtually all label was still confined to the carcass, even at the end of a 24-hr period. After i.p. injection label recovery varied significantly from mouse to mouse, from very low to a level approximating that seen after i.v. injection. This close correlation suggests that the fate of a subsequent transplant is decided within a few hours after antigen deposition, well before placement of the transplant itself."
6624865	"Induction and secretion of acid phosphatases (APases) is thought to be an adaptive mechanism that helps plants survive and grow under phosphate (Pi) deprivation. In Arabidopsis, there are 29 purple acid phosphatase (AtPAP) genes. To systematically investigate the roles of different AtPAPs, we first identified knockout or knock-down T-DNA lines for all 29 AtPAP genes. Using these atpap mutants combined with in-gel and quantitative APase enzyme assays, we demonstrated that AtPAP12 and AtPAP26 are two major intracellular and secreted APases in Arabidopsis while AtPAP10 is mainly a secreted APase. On Pi-deficient (P-) medium or P- medium supplemented with the organophosphates ADP and fructose-6-phosphate (Fru-6-P), growth of atpap10 was significantly reduced whereas growth of atpap12 was only moderately reduced, and growth of atpap26 was nearly equal to that of the wild type (WT). Overexpression of the AtPAP12 or AtPAP26 gene, however, caused plants to grow better on P- or P- medium supplemented with ADP or Fru-6-P. Interestingly, Pi levels are essentially the same for the WT and overexpressing lines, although these two types of plants have significantly different growth phenotypes. These results suggest that the APases may have other roles besides enhancing internal Pi recycling or releasing Pi from external organophosphates for plant uptake."
3956463	"With current immunosuppressive protocols, the incidence of graft loss to acute rejection has been markedly reduced; however, there has been no change in graft loss to chronic rejection. Recently, attention has been focused on the prevention and management of chronic rejection. Because neither the clinical course nor the biopsy is definitive for the diagnosis of chronic rejection, we believe both should be included in the definition. For kidney transplant recipients, the major risk factor for development of chronic rejection appears to be a previous acute rejection episode. Other risk factors include low-dose maintenance immunosuppression and previous infection. For extrarenal transplant recipients, CMV and HLA mismatch have been implicated. Noncompliance probably plays a role for all patients. Laboratory studies have suggested that the development of chronic rejection (or lack thereof) may be due to an interplay of immunoregulatory factors. Patients with anti-HLA antibodies have an increased incidence of late graft loss whereas those with antiidiotypic antibodies or with donor-specific hyporesponsiveness (in MLC) have improved outcome and less chronic rejection. These findings have led to five testable hypotheses as to the pathogenesis of chronic rejection: 1) chronic rejection is inadequately treated acute rejection; 2) chronic rejection can be prevented by maintaining adequate long-term immunosuppression; 3) preventing or adequately treating infection will prevent chronic rejection; 4) the balance of immunoregulatory factors determines chronic rejection; 5) chronic rejection is the result of noncompliance. Each may play a role in some patients. Clinical and laboratory studies of risk factors and of the influence of intervention are necessary."
6244900	"Liver transplantation (LT) remains the only cure for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in many cases. Over many years, most centers have applied the Milan criteria for selecting cirrhotic patients with HCC for LT. In a new era where several transplant groups are pushing the limits of transplanting HCC outside Milan criteria as an aggressive approach with promising results, we present interesting images of a patient that presented a unique and rare site of HCC metastasis after 36 months of liver transplantation."
1211800	"Linear IgA disease (LAD) of adults and children is a dapsone-responsive, autoimmune subepidermal blistering disease characterized by linear IgA deposits at the basement membrane zone (BMZ) of the skin and mucosa. Circulating IgA antibodies to BMZ components are often present. In this study we investigated the ultrastructural localization of the antigens and autoantibodies in six patients with LAD (five adults and one child). Using a direct postembedding immunogold electron microscopy (EM) technique, three different patterns of IgA antibody deposition were seen in the skin of four patients with LAD. The IgA deposits localized within the uppermost part of the lamina lucida and to the basal surface of the hemidesmosome in two patients, to the lamina lucida in one, and to the lamina densa in the fourth patient. Using an indirect immunogold EM technique and serum or purified blister fluid from two additional LAD patients, we showed that the serum autoantibodies of one patient bound to the hemidesmosome of the BMZ, while the autoantibodies in the blister fluid of the other patient bound to the lamina densa and sublamina densa including the anchoring fibrils in a labelling pattern similar to that of the monoclonal antibody (LH7.2) to collagen VII. All the autoantibodies binding to the hemidesmosome or lamina lucida recognized a protein in epidermal extracts of molecular weight 180 kDa or its breakdown product of 97 kDa, 200 kDa or 230 kDa. The antibodies binding to the lamina densa recognized proteins of 180 and 285 kDa. The antibodies that bound to the lamina densa and anchoring fibrils recognized collagen VII. In this immunogold EM study we have shown four patterns of IgA labelling in six patients with LAD, associated with five different antigens as recognized by immunoblotting. These results, together with our previous immunofluorescence and immunoblotting findings add support to the contention that LAD is a heterogeneous disease as regards both the target antigens and epitopes."

Dimension ranged between 4 to 5 cm     2       and greater than 30 cm     2      . The initial diagnosis was never cutaneous lymphoma, and all patients received various diagnoses including rosacea, alopecia, erysipelas, discoid lupus erythematosus, angiosarcoma, Borrelia infection, or sarcoidosis. Histologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of FCL in all patients.

All subjects had computer-recorded histories of between 6 months and 5 years before, and at least 12 months after, their first isotretinoin or antibiotic prescription.                                                                                      Prevalence rates of neurotic and psychotic disorders, suicide, and attempted suicide were compared between isotretinoin and antibiotic users and within isotretinoin users as their own comparison (pretreatment vs posttreatment). The results were expressed as relative risks, calculated using multiple logistic regression analyses.                                                                              Relative risk estimates, comparing isotretinoin use and oral antibiotic use with nonexposure to either drug for newly diagnosed depression or psychosis, were approximately 1.0 regardless of the data source. Similarly, relative risk estimates were all around 1.0 when comparing before with after isotretinoin use. The relative risk estimate for suicide and attempted suicide was 0.9 (95% confidence interval, 0.3-2.4) when comparing current isotretinoin exposure with nonexposure.                                                                                     This study provides no evidence that use of isotretinoin is associated with an increased risk for depression, suicide, or other psychiatric disorders."
3412965	"We have investigated the effect of histamine on pig epidermal cell outgrowths in vitro. Histamine inhibited the epidermal cell outgrowths (and also mitosis). This inhibition was partially counteracted by a specific H2 antagonist, cimetidine. Inhibition was maximal at a histamine concentration of 10(-4) M and was less at 10(-3) M. These histamine concentrations respectively coincide with the optimal concentrations for accumulating intracellular cyclic AMP (via H2 receptors) and cyclic GMP (via H1 receptors) in the same pig epidermal slice system. 4-Methyl-histamine, a pure H2 agonist, which only increased the intracellular cyclic AMP level but not the cyclic GMP level, caused a maximal outgrowth inhibition at 10(-3) M. Attempts to counteract the histamine effects due to cyclic GMP accumulation by various H1 antagonists (so that 10(-3) M histamine would have caused maximal outgrowth inhibition) were unsuccessful, since the addition of each H1 antagonist alone strongly inhibited the outgrowth. These data strongly suggest a dual role of histamine through the cyclic nucleotide system; i.e., histamine inhibits epidermal cell growth by elevating the intracellular cyclic AMP level via an H2 receptor, while histamine at high concentrations (10(-3) M) partially counteracts the inhibition by increasing cyclic GMP via an H1 receptor."
6944059	"Excessive amounts of nickel (Ni) can be toxic for plants. Recently, we reported that IRT1, the primary iron (Fe) uptake transporter in roots, meditates excess Ni accumulation in Arabidopsis thaliana. We also found that Ni exposure increases IRT1 expression in roots, suggesting that Ni uptake is further induced by Ni stress. Here, we show that Ni exposure induces expression of not only IRT1, but also FRO2, a ferric reductase in the root epidermis, and FIT, a transcription factor regulating the expression of genes involved in Fe homeostasis including IRT1 and FRO2. This result suggests that Ni accumulation induces an Fe-deficient response and leads to the induction of IRT1. Our findings suggest that excess Ni causes Fe deficiency at the molecular level and induces Fe deficiency signaling in plant cells."

Prospective, uncontrolled study.                                                                              University hospital vulvar clinic. Patients Twelve consecutive patients treated with 5% imiquimod cream for undifferentiated VIN between March 1, 1999, and May 31, 2001.                                                                                   Self-application of 5% imiquimod cream, initially 3 times a week, then adjusted according to tolerance, for up to 7 months according to clinical response.                                                                                            Therapeutic response, clinically assessed by successive photographs and histologically confirmed for complete responders, was scored as complete, partial (>    or =50% decrease in lesion size), or failure. Tolerance was evaluated at each visit.                                                                              A total of 3, 4, and 5 patients achieved complete response, partial response (>    or =75% reduction in lesion size for all such cases), and failure, respectively. Mean duration of treatment was 3.6 months (37.3 applications), 5.0 months (50.7 applications), and 3.4 months (25.2 applications) for complete responders, partial responders, and failures, respectively. Follow-up after treatment was 5 to 18, 14 to 32, and 2 to 28 months, respectively, with 1 partial responder lost to long-term follow-up. No patient developed invasive carcinoma. All but 2 patients experienced vulvar discomfort, resulting in treatment withdrawal for 3. Two patients had flulike symptoms.                                                                                      Imiquimod cream could be a therapeutic option for undifferentiated VIN. Although poorly tolerated, this self-applied treatment could spare patients, either totally or partially, the classic painful and sometimes mutilating treatments of VIN. Controlled, randomized studies are needed to evaluate its efficacy and tolerance."
5631934	"In a double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter comparative trial in 84 evaluable patients with severe, localized plaque psoriasis, 0.05% halobetasol propionate ointment proved significantly superior (p = 0.02) to 0.1% betamethasone valerate ointment with respect to the success rate, as indicated by ratings of ""healed"" or ""marked improvement"" (88.1% versus 64.3%). The therapeutic effect was observed within 5 days of the start of treatment in 76% and 67% of the patients treated with halobetasol propionate and betamethasone valerate ointments, respectively. Both preparations were well tolerated. Minor adverse effects at the site of application were reported in only 2% of the patients in each treatment group. Neither skin atrophy nor systemic adverse effects were observed."

2509537	It is important to achieve primary stabilization of dental implants that will be immediately loaded. Noninvasive devices that test the stability of immediately provisionalized implants placed into fresh extraction sockets are discussed. A titanium threaded implant was placed into a fresh extraction socket of a patient's nonrestorable mandibular right canine. The implant received an interim restoration immediately following its placement. The stability of the bone-implant complex was evaluated from the day of implant insertion through day 246 using an electronic percussive testing instrument. During the first month the bone-implant complex became progressively less stable reaching a peak measured level of instability at 30 days postimplantation. This was followed by progressive stabilization first measured on day 46 as the implant continued to osseointegrate. These findings suggest that the bone-implant complex became less stable during the first month after implant placement and was followed by a period of progressive stabilization reflecting bone maturation around the implant. A search of the literature found similar results in a study of single-stage implants (not immediately provisionalized) using resonance frequency analysis. The known sequence of wound healing around dental implants is reviewed to explain the findings of this pilot evaluation. Studies that use noninvasive testing devices to assess implant stability at placement and during healing may provide information that can help to optimize implant treatment outcomes.
5481205	"A 67-year-old male patient twice developed severe angioedema after enjoying a meal and an after-dinner snuff. The cause for these allergic reactions was a type I allergy to tobacco contained in the snuff. In addition to positive prick tests to tobacco, specific serum IgE antibodies (CAP-FEIA) to snuff were found, while prick tests and RASTs for suspected foods were negative. Tobacco belongs to the family Solanaceae which includes tomatoes and potatoes and comes from South America. Whenever allergic reactions together with tobacco snuff use occur, a possible type I allergy should be considered and investigated."
9996916	"The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of the standardised extract SHR-5 of roots of Rhodiola Rosea L. in the treatment of individuals suffering from stress-related fatigue. The phase III clinical trial took the form of a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with parallel groups. Participants, males and females aged between 20 and 55 years, were selected according to the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare diagnostic criteria for fatigue syndrome. A total of 60 individuals were randomised into two groups, one ( N = 30) of which received four tablets daily of SHR-5 extract (576 mg extract/day), while a second ( N = 30) received four placebo tablets daily. The effects of the extract with respect to quality of life (SF-36 questionnaire), symptoms of fatigue (Pines' burnout scale), depression (Montgomery -Asberg depression rating scale - MADRS), attention (Conners' computerised continuous performance test II - CCPT II), and saliva cortisol response to awakening were assessed on day 1 and after 28 days of medication. Data were analysed by between-within analyses of variance. No serious side effects that could be attributed to the extract were reported. Significant post-treatment improvements were observed for both groups (placebo effect) in Pines' burnout scale, mental health (SF-36), and MADRS and in several CCPT II indices of attention, namely, omissions, commissions, and Hit RT SE. When the two groups were compared, however, significant effects of the SHR-5 extract in comparison with the placebo were observed in Pines' burnout scale and the CCPT II indices omissions, Hit RT SE, and variability. Pre- VERSUS post-treatment cortisol responses to awakening stress were significantly different in the treatment group compared with the control group. It is concluded that repeated administration of R. ROSEA extract SHR-5 exerts an anti-fatigue effect that increases mental performance, particularly the ability to concentrate, and decreases cortisol response to awakening stress in burnout patients with fatigue syndrome."

Recent studies have increased our appreciation of the risk factors that predispose to dnDSA while illuminating how these risk factors may relate to the pathophysiology underlying its development. In addition, details regarding the natural history of dnDSA are now available in the context of the different clinical pathologic phenotypes that occur in the patients in whom it develops. Common pitfalls in defining and monitoring dnDSA, when understood, may provide some explanation for the heterogeneity in published studies.                                                                                  Recognizing that dnDSA is a major cause of late graft loss, and, more importantly, is detectable in many cases long before dysfunction or graft loss occurs, identifies an opportunity to intervene and change the outcome for the patient."
4973911	"Superficial white onychomycosis (SWO) is a clinical term used to describe onychomycosis in which the invasion of the nail plate occurs from the dorsal surface. However, recent observations indicate that the clinical appearances may vary to include infection in patches or in a striate patter. This report shows that, in some cases, it may be combined with either distal and lateral subungual onychomycosis or proximal white subungual onychomycosis. Invasion of the dorsal nail surface, but originating from the proximal nail fold, is another route of infection in SWO. A new classification of this condition is proposed with 4 main variants. Although based on clinical features, often other factors such as immunosuppression or invading organism (eg, Trichophyton rubrum or Fusarium species) appear to play a role in the development of a particular pattern of infection. This is an observational study carried out by trained and experienced clinicians. The main clinical implication is that in combined forms, or where the infection emerges from beneath the proximal nailfold, systemic rather than topical antifungal therapy is advised."
7578941	"Most dioecious plant species are believed to derive from hermaphrodite ancestors. The regulatory pathways that have been modified during evolution of the hermaphrodite ancestors and led to the emergence of dioecious species (with separate sexes) still remain unknown. Silene latifolia is a dioecious plant species harbouring XY sex chromosomes. To identify the molecular mechanisms involved in female organ suppression in male flowers of S. latifolia, we looked for genes potentially involved in the establishment of floral organ and whorl boundaries. We identified Arabidopsis thaliana homologs of SHOOTMERISTEMLESS (STM) and CUP SHAPED COTYLEDON 1 (CUC1) and CUC2 genes in S. latifolia. Our phylogenetic analyses suggest that we identified true orthologs for both types of genes. Detailed expression analyses showed a conserved expression pattern for these genes between S. latifolia and A. thaliana, suggesting a conserved function of the corresponding proteins. Both orthologs showed clear differences in their expression pattern between males and females or hermaphrodites suggesting their possible involvement in the sex determination pathway in S. latifolia."
1809289	"The term linear IgA bullous dermatosis defines an immune-mediated blistering skin disease characterized by pruritic blisters, subepidermal separation with neutrophilic infiltration, and linear IgA antibody deposition at the basement membrane zone (BMZ). However, some patients with linear IgA bullous dermatosis demonstrate both IgA and IgG anti-BMZ autoantibodies on immunofluorescence. We describe four such patients and attempt to define this group of patients by studying their clinical, histopathologic, immunopathologic, immunoultrastructural, and immunochemical characteristics.                                                                              Clinically, all four patients had a generalized pruritic blistering skin disease consistent with linear IgA bullous dermatosis. Histopathologically, all four cases demonstrated subepidermal blister formation with a predominantly neutrophilic dermal infiltrate. Immunopathologically, tissue-bound IgA (in four of four patients) and IgG (in three of four patients) antibodies were detected at the BMZ. Circulating IgA (in four of four patients) and IgG (in four of four patients) labeled the epidermal BMZ of normal human skin fractured at the lamina lucida and did not label the dermal BMZ. By immunoblot analyses, IgA (in three of three patients) and IgG (in one of three patients) circulating antibodies labeled the 97-kd linear IgA bullous dermatosis antigen. By direct immunoelectron microscopy, IgA and IgG antibodies were localized (in two of two patients) exclusively within the upper lamina lucida of the BMZ.                                                                                      Four cases of an immune-mediated blistering skin disease typical for linear IgA bullous dermatosis demonstrated both IgA and IgG anti-BMZ autoantibodies against the linear IgA bullous dermatosis antigen within the upper lamina lucida. We conclude that linear IgA bullous dermatosis should include a subgroup of patients with both IgA and IgG anti-BMZ autoantibodies."
3563776	"Modifications in implant surface topography and chemistry may alter the early bone response at different levels. This study characterized four implant surfaces and evaluated the biomechanical fixation and histologic response at early implantation times in a canine radius model.                                                                                            External-hexagon Branemark-type implants were used with four experimental surfaces: microblasted (MI), acid-etched and microblasted (AAM), anodized (A), and discrete crystalline deposition (DCD). Surface topography was assessed by scanning electron microscopy, interferometry, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The implants were placed in the central region of the radii of eight beagle dogs and remained in vivo for 10 or 30 days. The implants were torqued to interface failure, and a general linear statistical model with torque as the dependent variable and implant surface and time in vivo as independent variables was used.                                                                              All surfaces presented were textured, and different surface chemistries were observed. No significant differences between implant surfaces were observed for torque at 10 days. However, at 30 days, the AAM surface presented significantly higher torque values compared to the DCD and A surfaces. Significantly higher torque values were observed at 30 days compared to 10 days (P <    .001).                                                                                      Significantly different biomechanical fixation dependent on surface preparation was observed after 30 days, and all surfaces were biocompatible and osteoconductive."
8449794	"Pemphigus is a rare autoimmune blistering disorder. The mainstay of current treatment is high-dose oral corticosteroid therapy in combination with a steroid-sparing agent. Adjuvant therapy is important for disease control and to reduce the iatrogenic effects of oral prednisolone. Pulsed therapy with intravenous methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide (PPC) has been shown to be an effective treatment but there are currently few data on its use in patients who have failed to respond to conventional immunosuppression.                                                                                   To report the clinical and immunological responses of 21 patients with pemphigus refractory to prednisolone and azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil treated in our department with a standard protocol of monthly PPC.                                                                              Patients with pemphigus were identified who had undergone PPC therapy during the period between 1997 and 2006. Initial clinical severity and response to treatment was assessed. In addition, change in intercellular antibody titres and desmoglein 1 and 3 antibodies to PPC therapy was also recorded.                                                                              Of the 21 patients treated, seven had an excellent response, two a good response, five a moderate response, six a minimal response and one patient had no clinical response. Four patients achieved complete clinical remission and the number of pulses for these patients varied between 11 and 22. We observed significant reductions in indirect immunofluorescence titres for normal human skin substrate (P = 0.0078) and antidesmoglein 1 and 3 autoantibody levels (P = 0.007 and P = 0.0085, respectively) from pre-PPC therapy to 1 year after the last pulse. All patients were able to reduce their prednisolone dose from a pre-pulsing median dose of 40-10 mg at the last pulse with a median dose reduction of 66% (P <    0.001). The most common adverse effect was transient lymphopenia (12 patients); nonlife-threatening sepsis (seven patients) and premature ovarian failure (two patients) also occurred.                                                                                      PPC can be an effective treatment for refractory pemphigus but its adverse effects should be considered prior to therapy and closely monitored in patients on treatment."

In addition, most packages are not clinician friendly, as they require that commands be written based on statistical languages. This report describes the statistical software 'EZR' (Easy R), which is based on R and R commander. EZR enables the application of statistical functions that are frequently used in clinical studies, such as survival analyses, including competing risk analyses and the use of time-dependent covariates, receiver operating characteristics analyses, meta-analyses, sample size calculation and so on, by point-and-click access.

Cross-hybridization with three Adh2 cDNA clones suggested that the entire coding region of the Adh1 gene was contained on a 6.2 kb Xba I/Hind III subfragment. Using RFLP linkage analysis, the genomic clone was mapped on chromosome 4 between the markers TG 182 and TG 65 in a position corresponding to the Adh1 locus. To further confirm the Adh1 origin of the genomic clone, tobacco plants were transformed with the 6.2 kb Xba I/Hind III genomic subfragment. Isozyme analysis demonstrated that in transgenic tobacco plants functional tomato specific ADH-1 homodimers were synthesized as well as heterodimers composed of tobacco and tomato subunits."
6257176	"Transgenics for the expression of beta-carotene biosynthetic pathway in the endosperm were developed in indica rice background by introducing phytoene synthase (psy) and phytoene desaturase (crtI) genes through Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, employing non-antibiotic positive selectable marker phosphomannose isomerase (pmi). Twenty-seven transgenic lines were characterized for the structural organization of T-DNA inserts and the expression of transgenes in terms of total carotenoid and beta-carotene accumulation in the endosperm. Ten lines were also studied for the inheritance of transgenic loci to the T(1) progenies. Copy number and sites of integration of the transgenes ranged from one to four. Almost 50% of the transgenic lines showed rearrangement of T-DNA inserts. However, most of the rearrangements occurred in the crtI expression cassette which is adjacent to the right T-DNA border. Differences in copy numbers of psy and crtI were also observed indicating partial T-DNA integration. Beyond T-DNA border transfer was also detected in 25% of the lines. Fifty percent of the lines studied showed single Mendelian locus inheritance, while two lines showed bi-locus inheritance in the T(1) progenies. Some of the lines segregating in 3:1 ratio showed two sites of integration on restriction digestion analysis indicating that the T-DNA insertion sites were tightly linked. Three transgenic lines showed nonparental types in the segregating progenies, indicating unstable transgenic locus. Evidences from the HPLC analysis showed that multiple copies of transgenes had a cumulative effect on the accumulation of carotenoid in the endosperm. T(1) progenies, in general, accumulated more carotenoids than their respective parents, the highest being 6.77 mug/g of polished seeds. High variation in the carotenoid accumulation was observed within the T(1) progenies which could be attributed to the variation in the structural organization and expression of transgenes, minor variations in the genetic background within the progeny plants, or differences in the plant microenvironments. The study identified lines worthy of further multiplication and breeding based on transgene structural integrity in the segregating progeny and high expression levels in terms of the beta-carotene accumulation."
4739536	"Many organisms, including bacteria, fungi, animal, plants and algae, utilize blue light to adapt to a fluctuating light environment. Plants and algae, and photosynthetic stramenopiles in particular, require light energy for photosynthesis and have thus evolved a range of sophisticated light-sensing systems to utilize light information efficiently for growth, development and physiological responses. LOV (light, oxygen or voltage) domain photoreceptors are widely distributed among prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, and the number of specific LOV photoreceptors are increased in certain taxa. In this review, we summarize the molecular basis and physiological functions of three different families of LOV blue light receptors specific to green plants and photosynthetic stramenopiles: phototropin, ZEITLUPE/FLAVIN-BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX 1/LOV KELCH PROTEIN 2 (ZTL/FKF1/LKP2) and aureochrome."
8761108	"Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare dermatological condition characterized by the rapid progression of a painful, necrolytic ulcer with an irregular, undermined border and commonly affects the lower extremities, mainly in the pretibial area. The diagnosis of PG is not easy. Due to lack of diagnostic laboratory test and histopathological findings indicative of PG, it is often misdiagnosed as an infection. This results in delayed or inappropriate treatment of the condition, which leads to devastating consequences such as limb amputation and death.                                                                                        We report a rare case of a 51-year-old female who was initially diagnosed as having infected ulcers and underwent serial debridements, which resulted in extensive PG at three different sites (abdominal, left thigh, and sacral).

4004128	"It has been previously described that elevation of endogenous spermine levels in Arabidopsis could be achieved by transgenic overexpression of S-Adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SAMDC) or Spermine synthase (SPMS). In both cases, spermine accumulation had an impact on the plant transcriptome, with up-regulation of a set of genes enriched in functional categories involved in defense-related processes against both biotic and abiotic stresses. In this work, the response of SAMDC1-overexpressing plants against bacterial and oomycete pathogens has been tested. The expression of several pathogen defense-related genes was induced in these plants as well as in wild type plants exposed to an exogenous supply of spermine. SAMDC1-overexpressing plants showed an increased tolerance to infection by Pseudomonas syringae and by Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis. Both results add more evidence to the hypothesis that spermine plays a key role in plant resistance to biotic stress."

The aim of the study was to evaluate the contributing factors to nickel contact allergy (NiCA) in Asians who have a unique culture and lifestyle. We randomly selected 324 previously patch-tested patients, 162 nickel patch test (PT)-positive patients and 162 nickel PT-negative patients. The patients were telephone interviewed for their lifestyle information. Most of the nickel PT-positive patients (93.2%) were female with a mean age of 38.9 ± 13.3 years compared with the other group of nickel PT-negative patients who had a smaller proportion of females (76.5%) with an older mean age of 44.1 ± 14.9 years (P = 0.001). Multivariate analysis was able to establish that the significant risk factors for NiCA were female sex (odds ratio [OR], 6.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.15-18.94), young age (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.96-1.00), occupation with long periods of exposure to metal (OR, 3.08; 95% CI, 1.18-8.02), seafood (OR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.17-3.27) and canned food consumption (OR, 3.12; 95% CI, 1.17-8.33) (P <    0.05). The adjusted factors found to associate with NiCA were female sex, young age, occupation with long periods of exposure to metal, seafood and canned food consumption."
6722263	"The geminivirus protein AL1 initiates viral DNA replication, regulates its own expression, and induces plant gene transcription. To better understand how AL1 interacts with host proteins during these processes, we used yeast two-hybrid library screening and a baculovirus protein interaction system to identify plant proteins that interact with AL1. These studies identified a Ser/Thr kinase, a kinesin, and histone H3 as AL1 partners. The kinase is autophosphorylated and can phosphorylate common kinase substrates in vitro. The kinesin is phosphorylated in insect cells by a cyclin-dependent kinase. Immunostaining of Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis showed that kinase protein levels and subcellular location are regulated during plant development and geminivirus infection. By contrast, the kinesin is ubiquitous even though it is associated with the spindle apparatus in mitotic cells. Together, our results establish that AL1 interacts with host proteins involved in plant cell division and development. Possible functions of these host factors in healthy and geminivirus-infected plants are discussed."

We have studied eight patients with epithelioid cell histiocytoma.                                                                              In addition to the routine stains, histologic sections were prepared by immunohistochemical techniques for S-100 protein, HMB-45, vimentin, alpha 1-antitrypsin, and common leukocyte antigen.                                                                              Epithelioid cell histiocytoma is characterized by proliferation of angulated epithelioid cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. Immunostaining for S-100 protein and HMB-45 were negative. The majority of cells had positive reactions to staining for vimentin and alpha 1-antitrypsin. Approximately 20% to 25% of cells also gave positive reactions to common leukocyte antigen.                                                                                     Immunostainings are useful in the differential diagnosis of epithelioid cell histiocytoma from the intradermal form of Spitz nevus."
4085175	"Dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria (DSH) is an autosomal dominant pigmentary genodermatosis characterized by hyperpigmented and hypopigmented macules on the extremities, which has recently been mapped to an 11.6-cM interval on chromosome 1q11-21. So far, most cases of DSH have been reported in Japan and dermatologists around the world might think this disorder mainly occurs in Japan. In fact, there are 17 DSH families including 136 cases reported in China since 1980, but most of them are described in Chinese.                                                                                   To refine the previously mapped region that facilitates the identification of the DSH gene and to delineate the clinical and genetic features of Chinese DSH cases by a literature review of 136 cases reported in China.                                                                              We performed genotyping and linkage analysis using polymorphic microsatellite markers at 1q11-22 in two Chinese DSH families, and reviewed all of the DSH cases reported in China since 1980.                                                                              A cumulative maximum two-point lod score of 3.68 was produced with marker D1S506 at a recombination frequency of theta = 0.00 in these two families. Haplotype analysis refined the DSH locus to a 9.4-cM interval flanked by D1S2343 and D1S2635. The genetic and clinical features of Chinese cases with DSH were summarized. In some Chinese cases, hyperpigmented and hypopigmented macules were scattered on the neck and chest, but among Japanese patients there were no similar skin lesions to be reported on these sites.                                                                                      This study confirms linkage of DSH to a previously mapped region and refines the DSH gene to a 9.4-cM interval at 1q21-22. Likewise, the literature review indicates that DSH is not an uncommon disorder in China and the differences in the distribution of skin lesions could be related to race and environment."
2585546	"Requirements for a functional hybrid muscular tissue are 1) a high density of multinucleated cells, 2) a high degree of cellular orientation, and 3) the presence of a capillary network in the hybrid tissue. Rod-shaped hybrid muscular tissues composed of C2C12 cells (skeletal muscle myoblast cell line) and type I collagen, which were prepared using the centrifugal cell-packing method reported in our previous article, were implanted into nude mice. The grafts, comprised three hybrid tissues (each dimension, diameter, approximately 0.3 mm, length, approximately 1 mm, respectively), were inserted into the subcutaneous spaces on the backs of nude mice. All nude mice that survived the implantation were sacrificed at 1, 2, and 4 wk after the implantation. The grafts were easily distinguishable from the subcutaneous tissues of host mice with implantation time. The grafts increased in size with time after implantation, and capillary networks were formed in the vicinities and on the surfaces of the grafts. One week after implantation, many capillaries formed in the vicinities of the grafts. In the central portion of the graft, few capillaries and necrotic cells were observed. Mononucleated myoblasts were densely distributed and a low number of multinucleated myotubes were scattered. Two weeks after implantation, the formation of a capillary network was induced, resulting in the surfaces of the grafts being covered by capillaries. Numerous elongated multinucleated myotubes and mononucleated myoblasts were densely distributed and numerous capillaries were observed throughout the grafts. Four weeks after implantation a dense capillary network was formed in the vicinities and on the surfaces of the grafts. In the peripheral portion of the graft, multinucleated myotubes in the vicinities of the rich capillaries were observed. Thus, hybrid muscular tissues in vitro preconstructed was remodeled in vivo, which resulted in facilitating the incorporation of capillary networks into the tissues."
2302799	"Complications of CVCs in 382 consecutive patients receiving a stem cell transplantation (SCT) were analysed. Early complications were pneumothorax (3.6%), haematothorax (0.5%), dislocation (3%) and dysfunction (3.6%). Eighty-seven-associated infections (22%) were observed, leading to removal of the CVC in 26 patients. More bacteraemias were associated with double- or triple-lumen CVCs, 19% vs 5% in single lumen CVCs (P <    0.0001). Coagulase-negative staphylococci were the predominant microorganisms in 72%. A special point of investigation was CVC-associated thrombosis and the prophylactic value of nadroparin. Two consecutive regimens with nadroparin were used and compared; 7 days 2850 IE nadroparin and 10 days 5700 IE nadroparin. The incidence of CVC-associated thrombosis was 6.9% in 382 patients with 390 catheters. The incidence was 8% in patients receiving one of the prophylactic nadroparin regimens compared to 6% in a comparable control group without prophylaxis. A short course of nadroparin was unable to prevent thrombotic complications after discontinuation."
1989065	"Current disease-centred therapies for CKD focus on preserving the GFR but often ignore patient-reported symptoms. This purpose of this report is to describe the development of an instrument to measure the presence and severity of a wide range of symptoms commonly attributable to CKD.                                                                              A 37-item questionnaire was administered along with the Kidney Disease Quality of Life instrument to 92 patients with CKD not on dialysis (24% black, 5% women, mean age 68 years, 68% with diabetes mellitus). To discover groups of symptoms, agglomerative cluster analysis followed by exploratory common factor analysis was performed. Construct validity, internal reliability, convergent and discriminant validity, test-retest reliability and finally the association of various symptom domains with objective measurements such as estimated GFR and haemoglobin were tested.                                                                              The top five symptoms of at least moderate severity in decreasing order of prevalence were 'tire easily', limited physical activity, nocturia, joint pain and 'stop and rest often'. Four common factors emerged that could be broadly classified into neuropsychiatric, cardiovascular, uraemia and anaemia symptoms accounting for 73% of the total variance in the sample. The coefficient alpha for each of these factors approached 0.9. The test-retest reliability in 41 patients over 8 weeks was likewise high. There was good convergent and divergent validity. However, there was little relationship between estimated GFR and symptom scores.                                                                                      The assessment of symptom burden among patients with CKD may be facilitated by incorporating this instrument in routine practice and clinical trials."

4820055	"Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects not only the skin but also other organs as well. Genetic factors play an important role in individual predisposition. Lately, a positive association has been confirmed between psoriasis and metabolic syndrome (MBS), in western as well as in Middle Eastern countries.                                                                            Assess the prevalence of MBS in Lebanese patients with psoriasis and the differential effect according to types and disease severity.                                                                              This was a case-control study including 150 psoriasis patients and 150 age- and gender-matched controls admitted to the dermatology clinics at the American University of Beirut-Medical Center, a tertiary care center in Beirut. Psoriasis severity was assessed by the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI). Blood samples were collected from fasting subjects and tested for glucose, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and C-reactive protein (CRP). Multivariate binary logistic regression models were built to assess the relationship between MBS and psoriasis, after adjustment for smoking as a possible confounding variable.                                                                              Patients with psoriasis were two times more likely to have MBS as compared to controls (35.3% vs 18.0%, P <    0.001) with an odds ratio (OR) of 2.4. All components of MBS were more prevalent in psoriasis patients than in controls. PASI score was greater in patients with MBS than those without MBS (10.5 ± 11.5 vs. 7.0 ± 8.1, P = 0.05). MBS prevalence tended to be higher in the inverse type than in others (52.2% versus 32.3%; P = 0.06) and in patients with nail pitting versus those without (45.3% vs. 28.2%; P = 0.03).                                                                                      This was the first study to assess the prevalence of MBS in Lebanese subjects with psoriasis and, to our knowledge, the first study that showed a higher likelihood of MBS in patients with inverse psoriasis and with nail pitting."
3895006	"Multiple forms of tyrosinase, T1, T2, T3, have been shown to differ with respect to carbohydrate moieties of these isozymes. We demonstrated that, in cultured B-16 melanoma cells, melanization can be completely interrupted by glycosylation inhibitors, such as glucosamine and tunicamycin, and that these inhibitors cause a selective loss of membrane-bound T3. It is further found that inhibition of melanization induced by glucosamine occurs even in the presence of protease inhibitors, such as phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and leupeptin, and that melanization inhibition is reversible upon removal of the inhibitor. In this report we have also examined the process of development and recovery of the tyrosinase isozymes in cells in which the interruption of melanogenesis has been released by the removal of these glycosylation inhibitors. The recovery process, which occurs during the period after interrupted melanogenesis and is a process of remelanization, has been biochemically followed. Tyrosinases obtained from the deoxycholate-solubilized large-granule fraction of these melanoma cells have been analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immediately after removal (0 h recovery) of the glycosylation inhibitor, loss of melanization and T3 is accompanied by T1 heterogeneity which is visualized as two electrophoretically distinct species, T1' and T1''. At this time, T1' and T1'' do not have a concanavalin A affinitive carbohydrate moiety but do possess in vitro dopa reactivity. When recovery of melanization begins visibly 24 h later, T3 is re-formed with disappearance of T1 heterogeneity. By 48 h, the previous normal level of melanization is almost attained. These results suggest that maturation of tyrosinase may occur via T1' and T1'' as precursors of T3, or possibly T1 through the addition of N-glycosydically linked oligosaccharide moieties which can be interrupted by glucosamine and tunicamycin."
2450565	"Previous studies have demonstrated that i.v. presensitization of C57BL/6 (B6) mice with class I H-2-disparate B6-C-H-2bml (bml) spleen cells induced potent suppression of anti-bml CD8+ T cell-mediated responses in vitro as well as suppression of the allograft response. The present study analyzes the population of donor bml cells required for suppression of the generation of the cellular subsets involved in the in vitro and in vivo immune responses. Anti-bml CD8+ helper T cell (proliferative/IL-2-producing) activities were almost completely eliminated by i.v. inoculation of bml whole blood or various (T or B cell) fractions of spleen cells. However, anti-bml CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte capacity was significantly reduced by i.v. sensitization with bml T cell-containing, but not with T cell-depleted splenic fractions. In B6 mice receiving bml skin grafts following i.v. sensitization with T-depleted bml spleen cells, marginal Th activity was induced. However, the CTL response was equal to that observed in unsensitized mice, and allograft survival was not prolonged. Prolongation of bml graft survival was achieved by i.v. presensitization with bml T cell fraction, indicating that bml T cells were a requirement for suppression of graft rejection in the B6-bml combination. In contrast, in the B6-C-H-2bml2 (bml2) combination in which CD4+ T cells are responding to bml2 alloantigens, only the B cell fraction was capable of prolonging bm12 graft survival. These results indicate that functionally and phenotypically different subsets of alloantigen-reactive T cells are rendered unresponsive by i.v. presensitization with distinct fractions of donor lymphoid cells."

A 10-month-old pet female black and white Vietnamese pot-bellied pig presented to the emergency service with fever and erythematous to purpuric skin lesions affecting the intermandibular space and hocks. One week prior to the emergency visit, she had appeared restless and in pain. Two weeks following the emergency visit, she again presented to the large animal clinic with sloughing of the pigmented skin on her head, face, dorsal and lateral trunk sparing the nonpigmented skin and pigmented ears. The affected skin constituted ~40% of her total skin. Histopathological findings for affected skin included full-thickness epidermal and partial to full-thickness dermal coagulative necrosis with follicular epithelial mineralization, while that from normal-appearing pigmented skin was within normal limits. A culture from a skin biopsy yielded meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (ST-72). Treatments included oral antibiotics, pain management, hyperbaric oxygen therapy and general anaesthesia to facilitate debridement. Healthy skin was often present when the necrotic skin was debrided, although in some areas the necrosis extended into the underlying fat. Complications that occurred during rehabilitation included intense pruritus that resulted in self-trauma and the formation of a nasal fistula, which was later surgically corrected.                                                                                                              Cases of dorsal thermal necrosis in pot-bellied pigs are uncommon in the literature. Based on the clinical presentation and lack of another identifying cause, the lesions were attributed to a sun-induced thermal burn."
7022166	"Donor and recipient genders are not considered in lung transplantation (LT) programs. However, recent data have suggested a possible biologic effect of gender combination on the outcome of LT. We ought to evaluate the effect of gender combinations on early survival in a single-institution experience in transplant recipients.                                                                              We analyzed the potential effect of donor-recipient gender combinations (male [M] or female [F]) on early survival of all patients whose LTs were performed between January 1999 and December 2006. Patients were distributed into 4 groups: M donor to M recipient (M-M group); M donor to F recipient (M-F group); F donor to F recipient (F-F group); and F donor to M recipient (F-M group). The comparison between groups was performed using two-tailed Fisher exact test and analysis of variance (ANOVA).                                                                              During the study period, 152 LTs were performed in 149 patients, including 99 male donors and 53 female donors. The mean age of the recipients was 54 +/- 10 years (range, 14-70). The 30-day survival rate was 86% (95% confidence interval [CI], 77%- 92%) for the M-M group, 67% (95% CI, 41%-87%) for the F-M group, 89% (95% CI, 52%-100%) for the M-F group, and 83% (95% CI, 66%-93%) for the F-F group. No differences were observed between group survivals according to the Fisher test (P = .27).                                                                                      We found no association between donor-recipient gender mismatch and improved survival in lung transplant recipients. Further investigation is needed to finally understand the possible role of gender combinations in LT."
8571505	"Oxidative stress is a process involved in haemodialysis-related pathologies such as cerebrovascular diseases. Retinol is the major circulating form of vitamin A and it is elevated in haemodialysis (HD) patients. It is known that these patients present anaemia that is not totally responsive to erythropoietin. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of plasma retinol levels on oxidative stress biomarkers, especially on delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase.                                                                              Plasma retinol and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were quantified by HPLC-UV/VIS; blood activities of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase (ALA-D) were analysed by spectrophotometric methods, in HD patients (n = 29) and healthy subjects (n = 20).                                                                              The MDA and retinol levels, SOD and CAT activities were significantly increased in HD patients. ALA-D activity was significantly decreased. Retinol levels were correlated with MDA levels (r = 0.68), CAT (r = 0.39), SOD (r = 0.40) and ALA-D (r = -0.55). A partial correlation between retinol levels with ALA-D (r = 0.43), SOD (r = 0.30) and CAT (r = 0.36) activity was found, utilizing MDA levels as co-variable.                                                                                     Higher retinol levels may be associated with the increase of SOD and CAT activities, but this increase was not sufficient to prevent the lipid peroxidation and ALA-D thiolic group oxidation. In this manner, our results could suggest that high retinol levels contribute as an additional factor to the oxidative tissue damage."

Many emollient creams and lotions are available for use as preventive moisturizers. However, few controlled experiments have been published comparing the efficacy of active moisturizing products versus the vehicle used to deliver the products to the skin. Therefore, we conducted this randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical study to objectively compare a commercially available moisturizing product against its own vehicle. The active colloidal oatmeal moisturizer used in this study showed significant benefits versus its vehicle control in several dermatological parameters used to measure skin dryness."

A retrospective chart review was conducted for 2 time periods: January 1, 1991, through December 31, 1996, during which smooth-surface implants were utilized, and January 1, 2001, through December 31, 2005, during which rough-surface implants were utilized. This review included all implants placed and restored in 1 institution during the 2 timeframes. Data were specifically collected relative to patient age, gender, smoking status, implant diameter, implant length, and anatomic location of implants. Implants from the first and second time periods were followed through mid-1998 and mid-2007, respectively. Associations of patient/implant characteristics with implant survival were evaluated using marginal Cox proportional hazards models (adjusted for age and gender) and summarized with hazard ratios (HR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI).                                                                              A total of 593 patients (322 [54.3%] female; mean [SD] age, 51.3 [18.5] years) received 2,182 smooth-surface implants between 1991 and 1996, while 905 patients (539 [59.6%)] female; mean [SD] age, 48.2 [17.8] years) received 2,425 rough-surface implants between 2001 and 2005. Among the rough-surface implants, smoking was not identified as significantly associated with implant failure (HR = 0.8; 95% CI = 0.3 to 2.1; P = .68). In contrast, smoking was associated with implant failure among the group with smooth-surface implants (HR = 3.1; 95% CI = 1.6 to 5.9; P <    .001). Implant anatomic location was not associated with implant survival among patients with rough-surface implants (P = .45) and among nonsmokers with smooth-surface implants (P = .17). However, anatomic location affected the implant survival among smokers with smooth-surface implants (P = .004). In particular, implant survival was the poorest for implants placed in the maxillary posterior areas of smokers.                                                                                      Based on this retrospective study, the following observations were made: Smoking was identified as a risk factor for implant failure of smooth-surface implants only; among the smokers who received smooth-surface implants, an association was identified between implant failure and location of the implant placement; no association was identified between implant failure and location among the smokers who received rough-surface implants."
9714684	"The effect of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on callus cultures of four Digitalis species (Digitalis lamarckii, Digitalis trojana, Digitalis davisiana and Digitalis cariensis) increased catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), total phenolic, proline activity and cardiotonic glycoside production. Callus derived from hypocotyl explants was cultured on Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 0.25 mg L(-1) indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and 0.5 mg L(-1) thidiazuron (TDZ). After a month of culture, callus was transferred to MS medium containing 10 mM H2O2 and then incubated for 6 h. The amount of five cardenolides (Lanatoside C, Digitoxin, Digoxigenin, Gitoxigenin and Digoxin) as well as CAT, SOD, total phenolic, proline activity from Digitalis species were compared. No digoxin was detected in all treatments and control groups. The total cardenolides estimated were in the order of D. lamarckii (586.65  μg g(-1) dw), D. davisiana (506.79 μg g(-1) dw), D. cariensis (376.60 μg g(-1) dw) and D. trojana (282.39 μg g(-1) dw). It was clear that H2O2 pre-treatment resulted in an increase in enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants. However, a significant negative relationship between cardenolides production and overall activities of CAT, SOD, total phenolic and proline was evident. The described protocol here will be useful for the development of new strategies for a large-scale production of cardenolides."
7391569	"We investigated stomatal conductance (g(s)) and mesophyll conductance (g(m)) in response to atmospheric CO2 concentration [CO2] in two primitive land plants, the fern species Pteridium aquilinum and Thelypteris dentata, using the concurrent measurement of leaf gas exchange and carbon isotope discrimination. [CO2] was initially decreased from 400 to 200 μmol mol(-1), and then increased from 200 to 700 μmol mol(-1), and finally decreased from 700 to 400 μmol mol(-1). Analysis by tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) revealed a rapid and continuous response in g m within a few minutes. In most cases, both ferns showed rapid and significant responses of g m to changes in [CO2]. The largest changes (quote % decrease) were obtained when [CO2] was decreased from 400 to 200 μmol mol(-1). This is in contrast to angiosperms where an increase in g(m) is commonly observed at low [CO2]. Similarly, fern species observed little or no response of g(s) to changes in [CO2] whereas, a concomitant decline of g(m) and g(s) with [CO2] is often reported in angiosperms. Together, these results suggest that regulation of g(m) to [CO2] may differ between angiosperms and ferns."

Repeated investigations failed to demonstrate any specific bacteria or fungus responsible and trials of treatment with various antibiotics proved unsuccessful. Histology revealed a granulomatous abscess-like lesion, and the condition resembled what has been described as malignant pyoderma. The patient was successfully treated with oral dapsone and intralesional steroids."
6989186	"Hand eczema is a long-lasting disease with a high prevalence in the background population. The disease has severe, negative effects on quality of life and sometimes on social status. Epidemiological studies have identified risk factors for onset and prognosis, but treatment of the disease is rarely evidence based, and a classification system for different subdiagnoses of hand eczema is not agreed upon. Randomized controlled trials investigating the treatment of hand eczema are called for. For this, as well as for clinical purposes, a generally accepted classification system for hand eczema is needed.                                                                                   The present study attempts to characterize subdiagnoses of hand eczema with respect to basic demographics, medical history and morphology.                                                                              Clinical data from 416 patients with hand eczema from 10 European patch test clinics were assessed.

It is suggested that this classification be used in clinical work and in clinical trials."
3075235	"To determine the resuscitation preferences of hemodialysis (HD) Saudi patients, we con-ducted a cross-sectional, observational descriptive questionnaire study in two major tertiary hospitals in Saudi Arabia from March to December 2007. We enrolled all the patients on HD for two years or more, and excluded the patients who were transplant candidates, confused, or demented. The questionnaire was com-posed of 4 sections. The first 3 sections were concerned with demographic data, education levels, employ-ment, family size, number of children, and functionality status besides knowledge about cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), mechanical ventilation, and ICU admission. The fourth section contained different sce-narios and questions on personal and preferences such as end of life decisions, medical interventions, CPR, ICU admission, and the decision maker in these events. A total of 100 patients (53% males, 67% Saudis, and 85% married) were enrolled in the study. The mean duration on dialysis was 6.0 years (+/- 4.1). More than 70% of the patients viewed themselves as above average in the religiosity score, and 44% disclosed a good life quality. More than 95% had little or no knowledge about cardiac resuscitation, intubation, and mechanical ventilation. The majority of the patients authorized their treating physician to decide for them about cardiac resuscitation in case they did not make advanced directives and only 22% believed that this decision should be made by their family members. If their physician believed their condition was hopeless, 77% preferred to stay at home. We conclude that the majority of our patients had limited awareness about cardiac resuscitation measures. The majority of the patients trust their physicians to decide about the futility of resuscitation. Patients were able to decide reasonably well when they are well informed."
2236048	"Nicotianamine (NA) is an intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway of the mugineic acid family phytosiderophores (MAs), which are crucial components of the iron acquisition apparatus of graminaceous plants. In non-graminaceous plants, NA is thought to be an essential chelator for metal cation homeostasis. Thus NA plays a key role in Fe metabolism and homeostasis in all higher plants. Nicotianamine synthase (NAS, EC 2.5.1.43) catalyzes the trimerization of S-adenosylmethionine to form one molecule of NA. Barley, a plant that is resistant to Fe deficiency, secretes large amounts of MAs, whereas rice, a plant that is susceptible to Fe deficiency, secretes only small amounts. In this study we isolated a genomic fragment containing HvNAS1 from barley and three rice cDNA clones, osnas1, osnas2 and osnas3, from Fe-deficient rice roots. We also isolated a genomic fragment containing both OsNAS1 and OsNAS2. In contrast to barley, in which Fe deficiency induces the expression of NAS genes only in roots, Fe deficiency in rice induced NAS gene expression in both roots and chlorotic leaves. The amounts of endogenous NA in both the roots and leaves were higher than in barley. We introduced barley genomic DNA fragments containing HvNAS1 with either 9 or 2 kb of the 5'-flanking region into rice, using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Fe deficiency induced HvNAS1 expression in both roots and leaves of the transgenic rice, as occurs with rice NAS genes. Barley and rice NAS genes are compared in a discussion of alteration of the NAS genes during adaptation to Fe deficiency."
2820828	"The time course of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase activity and of starch accumulation rate measured in grain, from pollination to maturity, in Zea mays L. plants grown outdoors, was coincident for 2 years. No such correlation was observed in the adjacent leaf, which, furthermore, presented large year-to-year differences in starch accumulation pattern. Analysis of the expression of ADP-glucose synthase at the protein levels, using antibodies directed against the Bt2 or Sh2 subunits, established that the variation of activity in the grain was explained by parallel changes in the content of both subunits. The cDNA for Bt2 and Sh2 subunits were used as probes to quantify the corresponding messenger. In grain, the time course of Bt2 and Sh2 mRNA accumulation anticipated, with a similar pattern, the specific peptide variations, which suggests a transcriptional control of expression. By contrast, the control of leaf activity by protein content was less obvious than in the grain, and changes in leaf enzyme specific activity were suggested during the first 20 d after pollination. A clone homologous to the grain Bt2 subunit cDNA was isolated from a maize leaf cDNA library, and a sequence comparison showed that the leaf clone (L2) was a partial cDNA representing one-third of the mature peptide. A 97% homology was observed between Bt2 and L2 in their coding region, but homology was poor in the 3' noncoding border. This result demonstrates that Bt2 and L2 arise from different genes presenting a tissue-specific expression pattern and provides an explanation for the earlier reported differences between leaf and grain in the size of peptide and mRNA for the Bt2-homologous subunit."
9792078	"The identification of regulatory elements conferring high levels of expression in differentiating pine xylem will be valuable for genetic engineering of wood properties and will contribute to our understanding of gene regulation in this important group of forest trees. We examined the roles of both upstream and downstream elements in regulating the expression of two genes with preferential expression in developing xylem of loblolly pine. Gene constructs containing a PtX3H6, PtX14A9, or CaMV 35S promoter, the uidA gene encoding beta-glucuronidase, and a PtX3H6, PtX14A9, or NOS terminator were used to transform tobacco and hybrid poplar. When combined with the NOS terminator, neither pine promoter conferred xylem-specific expression in tobacco. When combined with the PtX3H6 promoter, an element at the 3' end of PtX3H6 reduced GUS expression resulting in preferential expression in vascular tissues. This silencing effect was not observed when the pine terminator was tested in conjunction with the CaMV 35S promoter. The PtX14A9 terminator did not increase tissue specificity. In leaves of transgenic poplar, both pine promoters conferred preferential GUS expression in veins when combined with the NOS terminator. The PtX3H6 terminator greatly decreased expression in leaves and stems when combined with the PtX3H6 promoter but only slightly altered expression when combined with the CaMV 35S promoter. An element at the 3' end of PtX14A9 increased GUS expression in veins when used in conjunction with either the PtX14A9 or CaMV35S promoter."
2756182	"Predialysis nephrologist care is associated with morbidity and mortality in incident dialysis patients, but the relationship with access to kidney transplantation (KT) is unclear. From a national study of incident US dialysis patients, we identified 2253 patients with detailed information about predialysis care, sociodemographic characteristics and comorbidities. We used multivariate Cox proportional hazards models to study associations between predialysis nephrology care and two outcomes: time from first dialysis to the first day on the KT wait-list, and time to first KT. Two-thirds of patients first encountered a nephrologist >   3 months prior to dialysis and one-third <   or=3 months prior to dialysis (early vs. late nephrologist care; ENC vs. LNC). Overall, 515 patients were added to the KT wait-list and 406 underwent KT during follow-up (2.3 years). In multivariate analyses, ENC was associated with a 41% (95%CI: 15-72%) greater rate of being wait-listed compared to LNC and a 54% (95%CI: 22-96%) greater rate of KT. Similar associations existed with number of predialysis nephrology visits. Earlier and more frequent predialysis nephrologist care were associated with greater access to the KT wait-list as well as a higher rate of KT, indicating that LNC may augment existing inequalities that impair access to KT."

Neutrophilic inflammation has been observed in several drugs that interfere with EGFR signaling, suggesting a class effect. The present case may be yet another manifestation of this particular reaction pattern."

We report a case of adult cutis calcinosis associated with dermatomyositis which responded dramatically to treatment with diltiazem."
7815866	"The localized form of granuloma annulare is usually self-limiting, resolving within 2 years. Generalized granuloma annulare, on the other hand, runs a protracted course, with spontaneous resolution being rare. It is also characterized by a later age of onset, an increased incidence of diabetes mellitus, poor response to therapy, and an increased prevalence of HLA Bw35.                                                                                  To assess the efficacy of monthly pulsed rifampicin, ofloxacin, and minocycline (ROM) therapy in the management of granuloma annulare.                                                                              Six biopsy proven patients of granuloma annulare were included in the study, five of the generalized variety, and one localized. Three of these patients were resistant to standard modalities of treatment. All six patients were treated with pulses of once monthly ROM till complete resolution of all lesions. Results were analyzed in terms of complete resolution of lesions and side effects. Presence of comorbid conditions was noted.                                                                             All six patients were successfully treated with 4-8 pulses of monthly ROM. None of the patients reported any adverse effects.

Treatment with pulses of once monthly ROM caused complete resolution of lesions in both localized and generalized granuloma annulare, even in cases recalcitrant to conventional therapy. There were no side effects in any of the patients. Larger trials are needed to substantiate the efficacy of monthly ROM in granuloma annulare."
4603651	"The worldwide seroprevalence of human BK polyomavirus (BKV) in adults is 80%. About 10%-60% of renal transplant recipients experience BKV infection, nephropathy of the graft may occur in 5% of the cases, and up to 45% lose the graft. The aim of this work was to describe the prevalence of BK viruria during the 1st year after transplantation.                                                                              An epidemiologic multicenter cross-sectional study was carried out in consecutive patients at each site with kidney transplantation from August 2011 to July 2012. Clinically significant viruria was defined as >   10(7) copies/mL. Viral DNA was extracted with the use of silica columns. Quantification was performed with the use of real-time polymerase chain reaction with primers that amplify a fragment of the large T-antigen gene and with a specific Taqman-MGB probe for BKV. For each assay, a standard curve with a quantified plasmid was included.                                                                              Of 402 renal transplant recipients at 18 renal transplant sites, we analyzed 382; median age was 46.33 years, and 46.40% were female. The median of the temporal distribution for urine samples was 153 days. BK virus was detected in 50/382 samples (13%), 18 with values >   10(7) copies/mL (4.7%). The median of the distribution of positive values was 123 days and the highest frequency of positive values was in months 3-7. The conditions of recipient older than 34 years and donor older than 41 years were the only ones that showed statistically significant association with BK viruria. No association with any specific immunosuppressive drug was observed.                                                                                      This is the first multicenter study conducted in Argentina to determine the prevalence of BK viruria in renal transplant recipients. Because of the growing number of the population susceptible to this infection, it is important to register and describe data about its epidemiology and associated risk factors."
7274587	"Intracellular pH must be kept close to neutrality to be compatible with cellular functions, but the mechanisms of pH homeostasis and the responses to intracellular acidification are mostly unknown. In the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, we found that intracellular acid stress generated by weak organic acids at normal external pH induces expression of several chaperone genes, including ROF2, which encodes a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase of the FK506-binding protein class. Loss of function of ROF2, and especially double mutation of ROF2 and the closely related gene ROF1, results in acid sensitivity. Over-expression of ROF2 confers tolerance to intracellular acidification by increasing proton extrusion from cells. The activation of the plasma membrane proton pump (H(+) -ATPase) is indirect: over-expression of ROF2 activates K(+)  uptake, causing depolarization of the plasma membrane, which activates the electrogenic H(+)  pump. The depolarization of ROF2 over-expressing plants explains their tolerance to toxic cations such as lithium, norspermidine and hygromycin B, whose uptake is driven by the membrane potential. As ROF2 induction and intracellular acidification are common consequences of many stresses, this mechanism of pH homeostasis may be of general importance for stress tolerance."
6144241	"We report the cases of five female patients with high skin phototype affected by relapsing, hypochromic, non-scaling macules occurring after the summer on the back and spreading over large areas of skin. Histological features disclosed decreased epidermal melanin. Psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) treatment proved to be beneficial, but new relapses were noted after stopping treatment. Clinical and histological features were consistent with the diagnosis of 'progressive and extensive hypomelanosis' described by Guillet in persons of mixed racial background. We discuss the differential diagnosis of the latter entity with respect to the other idiopathic acquired primitive hypomelanosis and hypothesize an overlapping with the so-called extensive pityriasis alba (EPA)."
1201646	"There is a discrepancy between demand and supply of donor organs for kidney transplantation. Health care providers can influence the willingness to donate or hold an organ donor card. It is unclear how educated current and future health care professionals are about organ donation and what constitutes their attitude toward this topic.                                                                              The authors conducted a cross-sectional survey among 1136 medical students and physicians to evaluate the knowledge about and attitude toward organ donation and transplantation at a large academic medical center in Germany. The authors used a 28-item questionnaire that included items on knowledge, attitude, and demographics.                                                                              Only 8% of the respondents felt sufficiently prepared for approaching relatives of potential organ donors. Knowledge about and attitude toward organ donation were highly associated with increasing level of medical education. In multivariate analyses, knowledge (odds ratio [OR], 1.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-1.25), attitude (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.02-1.04), and level of education (OR for preclinical students, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.20-0.76 compared with physicians) were significantly associated with the likelihood of holding an organ donor card, whereas age, gender, and personal experience with renal replacement therapy were not.                                                                                      Higher medical education is associated with greater knowledge about and a more positive attitude toward organ donation. Health care professionals with a higher education level are more likely to hold an organ donor card and also feel more comfortable in approaching relatives of potential organ donors. Educating health care professionals about the organ donation process appears to be an important factor in maximizing the benefits from the limited organ donor pool."

This review summarizes the functional aspects of the eccrine, apocrine, and apoeccrine sweat glands as encountered in health and disease. A series of measuring methods are conveniently used to explore any trouble in sweat production. These include the gravimetric method, water evaporation quantification, skin staining procedures, dye injections, casting replicas, average electrometric assessments, and skin capacitance mapping / imaging (SCM). Qualitative assessment is provided by collection of sweat and volatile compounds followed by chromatographic analysis. At present, SCM appears to be the most valuable method for assessing the number of active glands and their individual sweat production by the eccrine and apoeccrine glands."
4592628	"Incubation of unfixed and unfrozen slices of normal human skin allows visualization of a peroxidase activity associated with the perinuclear envelope and with the endoplasmic reticulum of resident dermal macrophages, dermal mastocytes, and also of some dermal fibroblasts. No peroxidase activity can be detected in fibroblasts cultivated in monolayer, while 80% of fibroblasts in an ""in vitro"" collagen lattice, called a dermal equivalent, express a peroxidase activity in the perinuclear envelope and the endoplasmic reticulum. Hence expression of this peroxidase activity in normal human skin fibroblasts serves as a marker of fibroblast differentiation and seems to depend on an interaction to fibroblast with the elements of a three-dimensional matrix."

To demonstrate the clinical spectrum of skin lesions of IVL and to correlate it with clinical outcome; to identify features differentiating between B-cell and T-cell IVL with skin involvement.                                                                              Review of 97 articles reporting on total of 224 patients with IVL.                                                                              Skin lesions were mentioned in 90 of 224 patients. They were nodules and/or plaques (49%) or macules (22.5%) of red (31%) or blue to livid (19%) colour on the leg (35%), the thigh (41%) and the trunk (31%). Telangiectases were present in only 20% of the patients. Oedema (27.5%) of the legs and pain (24%) were often accompanying. No criteria enabled distinction between lesions restricted to the skin and skin lesions concurrent with IVL in other organs, but when the disease was restricted to the skin, the prognosis was favourable (10% vs. 85% fatal outcome). Skin lesions of T-cell IVL are indistinguishable from those of B-cell IVL.                                                                                      Forty per cent of all patients with IVL have skin lesions, these being red, sometimes painful plaques located typically on the lower extremities, accompanied by oedema. A clinician risks misinterpreting these changes as thrombophlebitis, erythema nodosum or erysipelas. Neither clinical course nor differentiation of the lymphoma can be predicted from the morphology of skin lesions, but involvement of other organs at the time of diagnosis indicates a poor prognosis."
7186890	"The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and morbidity of two periodontal releasing incision techniques in vertical ridge augmentation.                                                                                            Twenty-three vertical and horizontal defects (Seibert Class III) were selected to compare the double-flap incision (DFI) to the conventional periosteal releasing incision (PRI). An incision technique was randomly assigned for flap advancement. The amount of flap advancement, the incidence of postsurgical complications, and the level of patient discomfort were compared. Flap advancement was measured with a UNC-15 probe as the difference between the initial elevated flap and the final advanced flap. Postsurgical complications including premature membrane exposure, infection, paresthesia, and continuous discomfort were noted at follow-up visits. A visual analog scale (VAS) was used to quantify the amount of pain, swelling, and bleeding in the patients.                                                                              An average of 9.64 ± 0.92 mm flap advancement was accomplished for DFI, whereas PRI advancement averaged 7.13 ± 1.45 mm (P <    .001). Premature membrane exposures occurred in two sites in the PRI group and one site in the DFI group. Paresthesia, infection, and continuous discomfort were noted in one site each in the PRI group. The difference between groups in the incidence of postoperative complications (PRI, 5; DFI, 1) was not significant (P <    .082). The mean pain, swelling, and bleeding scores for DFI (1.55 ± 1.21, 1.91 ± 0.94, and 0.40 ± 0.12, respectively) were lower than those of the PRI group (3.75 ± 2.63, 3.25 ± 1.29, and 1.16 ± 0.34, respectively) (P = .019, P = .010, and P = .061, respectively).                                                                                      Flap advancement was facilitated and morbidity was decreased in the DFI group. The technique may have potential to serve as an alternative to PRI to overcome some of the latter's limitations."

Between 1/1991 and 12/2001, 64 relapsed or refractory HD patients received an auto (n=46) or allo (n=18) BMT. A multivariate prognostic model was developed measuring time to relapse, progression or death. Median follow-up was 51.7 months; median EFS for auto and allo BMT was 36 and 3 months, respectively (P=0.001). Significant multivariate predictors of shorter EFS were chemotherapy-resistant disease, KPS <   90 and >    or =3 chemotherapy regimens pre-BMT. Patients with two to three adverse factors had significantly shorter EFS at 2 years (58 vs 11% in auto; 38 vs 0% in allo BMT patients). Despite a selection bias favoring auto BMT, the model was valid in both auto and allo BMT groups. We were able to differentiate patients at high vs low risk for adverse outcomes post-BMT. This prognostic model may prove useful in predicting patient outcomes and identifying high-risk patients for novel treatment strategies. Validation of this model in a larger cohort of patients is warranted."
6816412	"The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) is considered the gold standard assessment tool for psoriasis severity, but PASI is limited by its complexity and insensitivity in people with mild psoriasis.                                                                                  We sought to evaluate the product of a Physician Global Assessment (PGA) and Body Surface Area (BSA) (PGAxBSA) as an alternative to PASI.                                                                              Psoriasis severity was evaluated at 6-month intervals in participants of the Utah Psoriasis Initiative registry. Correlation coefficients were used to compare PGAxBSA with PASI and the Simplified PASI (SPASI).                                                                              Between August 2008 and November 2010, 435 assessments were completed in 226 participants. The median PASI score was 3.2 (interquartile range 1.8-5.4) and the median BSA was 3.0% (interquartile range 1.0%-5.0%). PGAxBSA had higher correlations with PASI than SPASI (0.87 vs 0.76, P <    .001). PGAxBSA also had higher correlations with a Global Patient Assessment of psoriasis severity (0.65) than both PASI (0.59, P <    .001) and SPASI (0.51, P <    .001).                                                                                      The use of PGAxBSA for measuring severe psoriasis and response to therapy is unclear, because most participants had mild to moderate psoriasis and data were not collected at predefined intervals in relation to therapy initiation. Interrater reliability was not assessed.                                                                                      PGAxBSA is a simple and sensitive instrument for measuring psoriasis severity."

The simultaneous occurrence of the two conditions and their regression after treatment of the toxoplasmosis suggest a possible relationship between the mast cell proliferation and the parasitic infection. Mast cell activation and stimulation may be transitory in response to a stimulus, causing reactional mastocytosis."
1584550	"The mechanisms underlying induction of UVB-induced immunosuppression are not fully understood, but tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) is suggested to play a central role. A single base pair polymorphism at position --308 in the promoter region of the TNF-alpha gene associated with an enhanced secretion of TNF-alpha has been identified in humans. We have therefore investigated the association of the --308 polymorphism with the risk of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in humans. The frequency of TNF G and TNF A alleles among Caucasian patients with a previous BCC (n=191) and health adults (n-107) were compared. For the TNF--308 polymorphism there was significant association between the genotype or allele frequencies and having BCC. To determine whether patients with a previous BCC had an increased capacity to secrete TNF-alpha, mononuclear cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. Mononuclear cells from patients with a previous BCC (n=15) demonstrated a significantly increased release of TNF-alpha upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (P<   0.03) compared with mononuclear cells age-matched control subjects (n=16). Further studies of other polymorphisms of the TNF-alpha gene associated with increased TNF-alpha production and BCC and necessary."
2709254	"Hidradenitis suppurativa is one of the follicular occlusion diseases favoring the flexural areas of the body. Because of the past failure of medical therapy, surgery is today the definitive therapeutic approach. There is a need for effective medical anti-inflammatory therapy to control the disease and minimize the pathologic and socioeconomic consequences of the disease process. Generally the patients fail to respond to topical or systemic antibiotics and retinoids. Temporary responses are achieved with intralesional steroids and cyclosporin.                                                                              The association of hidradenitis suppurativa with inflammatory bowel disease permitted the opportunity to utilize infliximab and to observe not only its impact on the bowel, but also skin.                                                                              Infliximab dramatically and favorably impacted on three cases of hidradenitis, but also in one of the patients who also had pyoderma gangrenosum.                                                                                      Infliximab appears to be an effective medical approach to the management of hidradenitis suppurativa and also to prepare the patient for ""curative"" surgery. However, one must be cognizant of the potential of acquired drug resistance or adverse drug reactions, which can be minimized by ""no vacations"" from this systematic therapy and the use of methotrexate to minimize the above potential problems."
8472746	"Mast cells and basophils are multifunctional effector cells of the immune system. Both are myeloid cells and originate from multipotent hemopoietic progenitor cells. Usually, human basophils complete their differentiation in the bone marrow. In contrast, mast cells usually undergo differentiation in extramedullary organs. During the past few years, growth factors for human basophils and a growth factor for human mast cells have been identified. Interleukin-3 is the most potent differentiation factor for human basophils and activates mature basophils via high affinity binding sites. Other basophil agonists are GM-CSF, IL-5, NGF and certain chemokines (IL-8, MCP-1). Mast cells apparently loose cytokine binding sites during mastopoiesis and as mature cells, do not express detectable amounts of IL-3R, GM-CSFR or IL-8R. However, in contrast to other myeloid cells, mast cells express SCF receptor/c-kit during mastopoiesis and on mature cells. Furthermore, the ligand of c-kit, SCF, induces differentiation of human mast cells from their progenitor cells and upregulates effector functions in mature mast cells."

Immediately after the injection, the patient felt a strong pain just above the injection site. In the following days a remarkable necrosis developed in the upper gluteal region. Topical therapy with antiseptics and a topical corticosteroid cream plus analgesia with tramadole revealed no improvement of the symptoms. We excised the necrotic area. Within 1 day, the patient was without pain."
3696623	"The aim of this study was to investigate in what ways in vivo anti-inflammatory treatment affects cytokine mRNA expression in situ in both erythema nodosum leprosum and reversal reaction patients. Serial biopsies were collected from the patients undergoing leprosy reactions before and during pentoxifylline (n = 7) or thalidomide (n = 3) treatment for erythema nodosum leprosum and prednisone (n = 3) for reversal reaction. Clinical evolution of the skin lesion was assessed during the study and semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to investigate cytokine mRNA expression at the lesion site. Results showed expression of interferon-gamma, interleukin-6, interleukin-10, interleukin-12 p40, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in all patients tested at the onset of reactional episodes, but interleukin-4 mRNA was rarely detected in the lesions (n = 4). Follow-up analysis showed that, irrespective of the drugs used, tumor necrosis factor-alpha mRNA was diminished in 10 of the 13 patients tested. A concomitant decrease of mRNA accumulation was also observed for interferon-gamma (nine of 11 patients), interleukin-6 (nine of 11), and interleukin-12 p40 (six of eight). An inhibitory effect on interleukin-10 mRNA was likewise seen after thalidomide and pentoxifylline, but not subsequent to prednisone treatment. The data also demonstrated that cytokine mRNA inhibition correlates to the resolution of the inflammatory response in situ (n = 10), whereas the persistence/enhancement of cytokine message expression after treatment was associated with worsening of the skin condition, as seen in three erythema nodosum leprosum patients whose maintenance of local inflammation was accompanied by the appearance/persistence of interleukin-4 gene expression in situ subsequent to anti-inflammatory treatment. In summary, the participation of cytokines in leprosy inflammatory episodes seems to be directly associated with the patients' clinical evolution following therapy for reaction."
5998811	"Despite a sizeable amount of research conducted hitherto into predictors of renal transplantation outcomes, there are scarce, data on predictors of in-hospital outcomes of post-kidney transplant rehospitalization. This study sought to provide a user-friendly prediction model for inpatient mortality and graft loss among rehospitalized kidney recipients.                                                                             This retrospective review of 424 consecutive kidney recipients rehospitalized after kidney transplantation between the years 2000 and 2005 used multiple logistic regression analysis to evaluate predictors of hospitalization outcomes.                                                                              Multivariate analysis showed that age at admission, diabetes mellitus as the cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), admission due to cerebrovascular accident (CVA), surgical complications were predictors of in-hospital death; age at transplantation, surgical complications, and rejection were predictors of graft loss. Equation for prediction of in-hospital death was Logit(death) -0.304 * age at transplantation (year) + 0.284 age at admission (year) + 1.621 admission for surgical complication + 4.001 admission for CVA-ischemic heart disease + 2.312 diabetes as cause of ESRD. Equation for prediction of in-hospital death was Logit(graft loss) = 0.041 age at transplantation (year) + 1.184 admission for graft rejection + 1.798 admission for surgical complication.                                                                                      Our prediction equations, using simple demographic and clinical variables, estimated the probability of inpatient mortality and graft loss among re-hospitalized kidney recipients."
8575024	"Oxidative stress is defined as an imbalance between pro-oxidants and antioxidants in favor of pro-oxidants. Photon emission (also called chemiluminescence) has been widely used to study oxidative stress in biological systems in vitro. In vivo chemiluminescence has been proposed as a non-invasive method to assess oxidative stress in the skin. UVA (320-400 nm part of the ultraviolet radiation) exposure is generally accepted as a source of oxidative stress in the skin. In this study, UVA-induced oxidative stress was studied by using an in vivo chemiluminescence detection method. First, the dose response and the fluence rate response of the UVA-induced oxidative stress in human skin were investigated by examining the decay kinetics of the chemiluminescence signal following UVA exposure. A kinetic model was proposed to help differentiate these two responses. We found that the initial burst of the chemiluminescence signal depended on the UVA fluence rate, whereas the decay of the signal following exposure can be related to the UVA dose involved. Second, a significant reduction of UVA-induced chemiluminescence signal was observed after tape-stripping, indicating that stratum corneum is a major source of UVA-induced oxidative stress in the skin. Furthermore, the oxygen dependence of UVA-induced chemiluminescence signal was also confirmed by application of a pressure cuff, implying that some of the oxidative stress occurs in the deeper layers of the skin. Finally, topical application of vitamin C before exposure significantly reduced the UVA-induced chemiluminescence signal. We thus conclude that chemiluminescence is an effective method to assess the oxidative stress induced by UVA in human skin in vivo."
2987483	"White, blue, red and purple corns (Zea mays L.) were lime-cooked to obtain masa for tortillas. The total phenolics and anthocyanins content, antioxidant activity expressed as total reducing power (TRP), peroxyl radical bleaching (PRAC), total antioxidant activity (TAA) and quinone reductase (QR) induction in the murine hepatoma (Hepa 1 c1c7 cell line) as a biological marker for phase II detoxification enzymes were investigated. Among the extracts prepared from raw corn varieties the highest concentration of total phenolics, anthocyanins, antioxidant index and induction of QR-inducing activity were found in the Veracruz 42 (Ver 42) genotype. The nixtamalization process (masa) reduced total phenolics, anthocyanins and antioxidant activities and the ability for QR induction when was compared to raw grain. Processing masa into tortillas also negatively affected total phenolics, anthocyanin concentration, antioxidant activities, and QR induction in the colored corn varieties. The blue variety and its corresponding masa and tortillas did not induce QR. Ver 42 genotype and their products (masa and tortilla) showed the greatest antioxidant activity and capacity to induce QR."
6916646	"Overproduction of interleukin-4 (IL-4) has been reported in lesional and in peripheral T cells from patients with atopic dermatitis (AD). It is not clear whether the development of IL-4-producing T helper type 2 (Th2) cells from naïve precursors is an intrinsic phenomenon of T cells or whether other, extrinsic factors play a significant role. To analyze these alternatives, we investigated the IL-4 production of effector T cells generated in vitro from highly purified CD4+ CD45RA+ naïve T cells in the absence of signals derived from antigen-presenting cells. Effector T cells generated from naïve precursors from both AD and healthy donors produced comparable amounts of IL-4 after restimulation. Priming in the presence of exogenous IL-4 enhanced the production of IL-4 while neutralizing endogenously produced IL-4 abolished IL-4 production similarly in atopic and healthy T cells. A subset of effector T cells acquired the expression of the cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA). The frequency of CLA+ T cells was not different between atopic and healthy donors. CLA+ T cells, differentiated from naïve atopic, but not healthy T cells, showed a preferential Th2 cytokine profile as assessed by intracellular cytokine staining. Also effector T cells derived from atopic patients without dermatitis tended to show this imbalance, although it was not significantly different to healthy controls. This Th2 cytokine profile did not develop when naïve T cells were cultured in the presence of IL-12. In conclusion, high IL-4 production in developing T cells from AD patients was associated with CLA expression, the net IL-4 production of all effector CD4+ T cells, however, was similar to IL-4 production by T cells from healthy donors."
6478845	"Recent advances in the development of reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) have allowed a broader range of patients to access allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Reconstitution of an effective immune system post-transplant, including natural killer (NK) cells, is critical for both tumor control and infectious disease control or prevention. The development and functions of NK cells in such settings remain elusive. Here we analyzed NK cell development in HLA-matched HSCT from related or unrelated donors, after RIC that included antithymocyte globulin (N = 45 patients). Our data reveal that NK cells quickly recover after RIC-HSCT, irrespective of donor type. Rapidly re-emerging NK cells, however, remain immature for more than 6 months. Effector functions resemble that of immature NK cells because they poorly produce IFN-γ and TNF-α in response to target cell stimulation, despite a rapid acquisition of degranulation ability and MIP-1β production. Strikingly, rapid reconstitution of cytokine production correlates with a lower relapse incidence (P = .01) and a better survival rate (P <    .0001) at 1 year post-transplant, whereas degranulation capacity was associated with less relapse (P = .05). Our study demonstrates rapid quantitative reconstitution of the NK cell compartment despite administration of potent immune suppressive drugs as part of the conditioning regimen and after transplantation. However, there is a prolonged persistence of functional defects, the correction of which positively correlates with clinical outcome."
6625973	"CT and MR have permitted radiology to play a greater, but not definitive, role in detecting the pathologic components of tuberous sclerosis. SEN may be identified in only 80% of patients. Tubers are more ubiquitous and readily identified by MR in children and adults when the brain is myelinated. Since tubers are predominantly peripheral hypomyelinated lesions, the detection of small lesions may be delayed until an infant is over 16-18 months of age when the myelin will have extended to the junction between the cortical white and gray matter. SEGA typically evolve later during the first and second decades of life. Successful genetic counseling implies a need to detect tuberous sclerosis at a stage during infancy when imaging may fail to confirm the diagnosis, so tuberous sclerosis remains a clinical diagnosis."
8186631	"Although psoriasis patients often report a negative impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and work productivity, less is known about how disease burden varies between periods of flare and remission. The aim of this study was tocompare HRQoL and work productivity by disease activity level. Data were extracted from Adelphi 2011/2013 Disease Specific Programmes, two real world surveys of US dermatologists and psoriasis patients. HRQoL was measured using the EuroQOL 5-Dimension Health Questionnaire (EQ-5D) and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Work productivity was measured using the Work Productivity Activity index (WPAI). Three levels of disease activity were constructed based on physician reports: remission, active not flaring, active, and flaring. Multivariable regression analyses explored the relationship between disease activity, HRQoL and work productivity, controlling for differences in demographics and comorbidities. Out of 681 psoriasis patients 24% were in remission, 62% had active disease without flaring, and 15% experienced active disease and were currently flaring. Greater disease activity was associated with worse HRQoL. EQ-5D scores decreased with more active disease (remission vs. active not flaring vs. active and flaring: 0.93 vs. 0.90 vs. 0.82; p&    lt;0.05), while DLQI scores increased (remission vs. active not flaring vs. active and flaring: 2.0 vs. 5.00 vs. 8.7; p&    lt;0.05). WPAI scores increased with disease activity indicating increased productivity loss (remission vs. active not flaring vs. active and flaring: 5.9 vs. 14.8 vs. 26.9; p&    lt;0.05). The same trends were confirmed by multivariable regression analyses."
7136472	"Photoaged skin contains elastotic materials in the upper reticular dermis. This phenomenon is commonly known as solar elastosis. In this study, we investigated the effects of heat on the expression of tropoelastin and fibrillin-1, two main components of elastic fibers, and on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-12, the most active MMP against elastin, in human skin in vivo. Heat was found to increase tropoelastin mRNA and protein expression in the epidermis and in the dermis. Fibrillin-1 mRNA and protein expression were increased by heat in the epidermis, but were decreased in the dermis. We found that pre-treatment of skin with N-acetyl cysteine or genistein for 24 h prior to heat treatment inhibited the heat-induced expression of tropoelastin, but not of fibrillin-1. These data indicate that reactive oxygen species may play a role in tropoelastin expression by heat, but not in fibrillin-1 expression. We also found that heat treatment increases MMP-12 mRNA and protein expression in human skin. Our results suggest that the abnormal production of tropoelastin and fibrillin by heat in human skin and that their degradation by various MMP, such as MMP-12, may contribute to the accumulation of elastotic material in photoaged skin."
4010240	"Phyllotaxis, the arrangement of a plant's phylla (flowers, bracts, stickers) near its shoot apical meristem (SAM), has intrigued natural scientists for centuries. Even today, the reasons for the observed patterns and their special properties, the physical and chemical mechanisms which give rise to strikingly similar configurations in a wide variety of plants, the almost-constant golden divergence angle, the almost constant plastichrone ratio, the choices of parastichy numbers and the prevalence of Fibonacci sequences to which these numbers belong, are at best only partially understood. Our goals in this Addendum are: To give a brief overview of current thinking on possible mechanisms for primordia (the bumps on the plant surface which eventually mature into fully developed structures such as leaves or florets) formation and give a descriptive narrative of the mathematical models which encode various hypotheses.To emphasize the point that patterns, whether they be phyllotactic configurations on plant surfaces or convection cells on the sun's surface, are macroscopic objects whose behaviors are determined more by symmetries of the proposed model and less by microscopic details. Because of this, the identification of observations with the predications of a particular model can only be made with confidence when the match coincides over a range of circumstances and parameters.To discuss some of the key results of the proposed models and, in particular, introduce the prediction of a new and, in principle, measurable invariant in plant phyllotaxis.To introduce a new model of primordia formation which is more in keeping with the pictures and paradigms of Hofmeister,1 Snow &     Snow,2 and Douady and Couder3,4 which see primordia as forming in a fairly narrow annular zone surrounding the plant's SAM separating a region of undifferentiated cells from a fully developed patterned state.To consider the challenge of phyllotaxis in the broader context of pattern formation in biological tissue which responds to both mechanical and biochemical processes."
5331897	"We present a case of necrobiosis lipoidica (NL) with atypical early lesions and good response to topical tacrolimus. NL is a disease with clinical features that are seldom misinterpreted. Often histology just confirms the clinician's diagnosis. Only in rare cases, the clinical presentation and the involved body sites may be misleading. A 67-year-old diabetic woman was admitted to our department with a well-defined, persistent plaque on her left arm and on her right shin. Histologic examination of both lesions revealed features of NL despite the dissimilar clinical presentation. The patient was treated with 0.1% topical tacrolimus ointment twice daily for 8 weeks and once daily for 8 weeks. A significant improvement and no further lesions were observed after 1 year of follow-up. A high index of suspicion regarding NL lesions with atypical clinical presentation on different body sites is advised in order to avoid misdiagnosis, wrong treatment decisions and ulceration. Additionally, it appears that topical tacrolimus treatment is an effective therapeutic option in patients with recent, non-ulcerated NL lesions."
1651042	"The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of low-dose recombinant interleukin-2(IL-2) administered to patients with acute lymphoblastic malignancy at high-risk of relapse after unmanipulated HLA-identical or HLA-haploidentical allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). We studied 19 patients with acute lymphoblastic malignancy who underwent IL-2 treatment for a high probability of disease recurrence after allo-HSCT between July 2004 and June 2006 at Peking University Institute of Hematology. With a median follow-up of 6 months (range, 3-19 months) after the first IL-2 therapy, 14 of 15 evaluable patients in our cohort were disease-free (93.33%), whereas one patient in 'high risk' pretransplantation category relapsed. Toxicities from IL-2 were mainly fever, pain, redness and swelling at the injection site. Four patients left the study because of hyperpyrexia. Local and reversible chronic GVHD was observed in 6 of 15 patients (40%). Similar cGVHD occurrences were observed between the two groups of patients undergoing HLA-identical HSCT (three of seven patients) and HLA-haploidentical HSCT (two of six patients), respectively. In conclusion, low-dose IL-2 subcutaneous administration from 100 days for a prolonged period could be a safe and effective strategy to prevent relapse in acute lymphoblastic malignancy patients with high risk of recurrence after unmanipulated allo-HSCT."

Deoxypodophyllotoxin (0.05 % in propylene glycol: ethanol: water = 5 : 3:2) was topically applied twice daily for two weeks to dorsal skin of brown guinea pigs that were exposed to UV irradiation using a solar simulator. Visual inspection and Fontana-Masson staining both demonstrated that deoxypodophyllotoxin reduced skin pigmentation and total epidermal melanin when compared to that of vehicle-treated areas, suggesting that deoxypodophyllotoxin maybe applicable to treat hyperpigmentation."

5637593	"A 5-year-old girl presented with a two-month-history of skin rash and general fatigue. She had a slight fever, progressive muscle weakness and liver dysfunction. Gottron's papules on her fingers and purple-reddish papules on her elbows were noted. Serum aldolase levels were highly elevated, however, creatine phosphokinase levels were normal. An MRI revealed abnormal high signal changes in her gluteus minimus muscles. Interstitial pneumonia suddenly developed and she died despite aggressive treatment with methylprednisolone pulse therapy followed by intravenous administration of cyclophosphamide, immunoglobulin and cyclosporine A. Interstitial pneumonia is rare in juvenile dermatomyositis; however, as in adult cases, it can be fatal. In order to prevent severe complications and functional disabilities, early aggressive treatments should be considered when muscle inflammation is refractory to ordinary treatment."
9071882	"Granulomatous cheilitis (GC) is a poorly understood disease process belonging to the larger group of orofacial granulomatosis. The treatment of GC has proven exceedingly difficult. While various treatments have been applied to GC, there has been no uniform or predictably successful model demonstrated in the literature. Poor understanding of the aetiological mechanisms underpinning GC has significantly hampered the development of an effective approach to treatment. Those therapies that have shown promise principally consist of agents with anti-inflammatory activity such as corticosteroids and immunomodulatory medications. On a careful review of the literature, we have found no systematic review and assessment of current treatments. We seek to address this absence in the available literature by providing a consolidated overview of current treatment for GC."
8871140	"Plant-ant interactions are generally considered as mutualisms, with both parties gaining benefits from the association. It has recently emerged that some of these mutualistic associations have, however, evolved towards other forms of relationships and, in particular, that plants may manipulate their partner ants to make reciprocation more beneficial, thereby stabilizing the mutualism. Focusing on plants bearing extrafloral nectaries, we review recent studies and address three key questions: (i) how can plants attract potential partners and maintain their services; (ii) are there compounds in extrafloral nectar that could mediate partner manipulation; and (iii) are ants susceptible to such compounds? After reviewing the current knowledge on plant-ant associations, we propose a possible scenario where plant-derived chemicals, such as secondary metabolites, known to have an impact on animal brain, could have evolved in plants to attract and manipulate ant behaviour. This new viewpoint would place plant-animal interaction in a different ecological context, opening new ecological and neurobiological perspectives of drug seeking and use."
2045437	"For a full understanding of the properties of the human skin barrier, physical macroscopic parameters of barrier function must be correlated to the structural organization of the barrier on a molecular level. This study was undertaken to relate differences in the relative composition of the three main lipid classes of human stratum corneum, i.e., free fatty acids, cholesterol, and ceramides, to differences in transepidermal water loss, stratum corneum electrical impedance, and corneometer value. A new high performance liquid chromatography/light scattering detection-based analysis method recently developed was used for collection of quantitative lipid data in conjunction with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry/flame ionization detection measurements on the free fatty acid fraction. After subtraction of contaminating lipid fractions we have estimated the molar ratio of the human skin barrier lipid composition to be, respectively, 15% cholesterol esters, 16% saturated long chain free fatty acids, 32% cholesterol, and 37% ceramides. The inter-individual difference in the relative amount of free fatty acids, cholesterol, and ceramides, respectively, can be >   100% in the individual case. It was found that the relative amount of ceramides to cholesterol is larger in the wrist area, paralleled by a higher transepidermal water loss and corneometer value as well as different skin electrical impedance values as compared with the upper forearm area. We conclude that the site-dependent differences in the stratum corneum lipid composition are small compared with the large inter-individual variation. Interestingly, in the individual case, no correlation was registered between relative ceramide content and barrier properties."

Our aim was to assess the carbon balance of vines growing with and without shade to quantify the impact of the covering.                                                                                  Whole vines were covered with 70 % shade cloth, and shoot leaf area and leaf, stem and bunch growth were followed over two growing seasons. Photosynthesis was measured in situ in all leaves along selected shoots over the growing season. A carbon balance was constructed from the difference in acquisition of carbon and the sequestration of carbon as biomass across the growing seasons.                                                                                        Shade covering had no initial impact on shoot growth but later reduced leaf growth and later still bunch growth. Stem growth was unaffected. Photosynthetic properties were characteristic of shade leaves, with lower rates and lower light saturation compared with well-exposed leaves. Overall, net photosynthesis was reduced by 40 % by the shade covering and was attributed to the reduced photon flux densities. From the carbon balance, vines were reliant on carbon reserves over 6 weeks after budbreak until current photosynthate increased sufficiently to supply the growth. Shade covering impacted most on biomass accumulation to leaves and bunches at the stage when the vines became autotrophic, consistent with the reduction in carbon acquisition. The markedly high carbon demand by bunches caused a mid-season negative carbon balance, implying that shoots had to draw further on reserves to supply the carbon.                                                                                      Shade covering over whole grapevines exacerbated the imbalance between the supply of and demand for carbon and greatly reduced vine biomass, especially reproductive allocation. Covering vines with shade cloth to protect the vines from heat events, therefore, had major costs in the carbon economy."
1139141	"Essential oil diversity was studied in wild Achillea millefolium from two different high altitude Himalayan habitats (1600 m, 2850 m) and their cultivated populations under uniform environmental conditions at lower altitudes of Jammu (300 m). The populations proved to represent two different ecotypes: the 1,8-cineole type and the borneol type with appreciable differences in the contents of oils and mono- and sesquiterpenes. Populations from all these habitats showed considerable overlap in various constituents and the major components were characterized as beta-pinene (10.6 % - 17.7 %), 1,8-cineole (3.0 % - 15.1 %), borneol (0.2 % - 12.1 %), and beta-caryophyllene (8.5 % - 16.2 %). No variation in morphology and chromosome number was observed under comparable environmental conditions from different habitats. Preliminary investigation indicates the existence of different ecotypes from the Himalayan habitats."
3336745	"Silene latifolia is a dioecious plant in which sex is determined by X and Y chromosomes. Expression of the B-function gene SLM2, an ortholog of PISTILLATA (PI) in Arabidopsis, was examined by in situ hybridization. SLM2 was not expressed in suppressed stamens of female flowers, but was expressed in developing stamens of smut-infected female flowers. These results indicate that the control of SLM2 is independent of the presence of the Y chromosome. Smut-infected females provide a useful system for clarifying the relationship between the B-function gene and the sex determination factor."
5842443	"The authors studied the bioavailability of minocycline in sebum and serum. Blood and sebum samples were collected weekly for 6 weeks from ten healthy volunteers taking 200 mg of minocycline every day for 4 weeks. Sebum was collected by direct extraction with petroleum ether from the forehead. After evaporation, sebum was weighed on a scale accurate to 10 micrograms. Determination of minocycline in serum and sebum was performed using a high performance liquid chromatography technique (HPLC), with a better detection limit at 352 nm than at 400 nm (20 ng/ml and 0.324 microgram/ml respectively). Our results contrast with other studies since no minocycline was detected in the sebum samples of treated subjects and microbiological assays of minocycline in sebum were also negative. In our opinion, the current hypothesis claiming that the effectiveness of minocycline in the treatment of acne vulgaris is based on sebaceous secretion should be reconsidered."
5807443	"The association between belatacept, a CD28 costimulation blocker, and invasive mycoses is unclear.                                                                                  We describe a patient who initiated belatacept 3 years after lung transplantation and developed invasive tracheobronchial aspergillosis, a disease encountered almost exclusively within the first 6 months after transplantation.                                                                                      Belatacept may have played a causative role. Until more data are available, belatacept should be used cautiously after lung transplantation."
8191890	"We report the first documented case of an inguinal hernia containing bladder, resulting in contralateral allograft hydroureteronephrosis. A 39-year-old male patient presented with allograft dysfunction, a contralateral inguinoscrotal hernia, and marked hydroureteronephrosis on ultrasound (US). Percutaneous nephrostogram and a retrograde cystogram suggested bladder herniation with incorporation of the contralateral ureteroneocystostomy into the hernia. Paraperitoneal bladder herniation was confirmed at surgery and hernioplasty was performed. Six-week follow-up revealed normal renal function with no sign of hernia recurrence. Despite occurring rarely, transplant ureter or bladder herniation should be considered in the differential diagnosis of hydroureteronephrosis. This case illustrates that the contralateral position of hernia to allograft does not necessarily preclude the hernia as the source of ureteric obstruction."
2093832	"Injection of regulatory T cells (Tregs) followed by sensitization with 2,4,6-trinitrochlorobenzene induced a transient increase in size and cellularity of skin-draining lymph nodes (LNs) in mice. This led us to hypothesize that Tregs may affect the trafficking of T cells from and to peripheral LNs. Two to three hours after sensitization, we found fewer CD8     +       T cells expressing CD62L in LNs compared with untreated controls. Injection of wild-type Tregs prevented this down-regulation of CD62L. In contrast, Tregs devoid of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-degrading ecto-enzyme CD39 were unable to do so. As for the mechanism of CD62L regulation, we found that ATP, which is released in skin upon hapten-exposure, is inducing the protease ADAM17 in LN-residing T cells via engagement of P     2      X     7       ATP receptors. ADAM17 cleaves CD62L from the surface of CD8     +       T cells, which in turn provide a signal for T cells to leave the LNs. This regulation of CD62L is disturbed by the presence of Tregs, because Tregs remove extracellular ATP from the tissue by activity of CD39 and, therefore, abrogate the shedding of CD62L. Thus, these data indicate that the regulation of ATP turnover by Tregs in skin and LNs is an important modulator for immune responses."
7834240	"Lipoid proteinosis is described in a family of Scottish descent. Chromosome studies performed on five members were normal. Direct immunofluorescence studies performed on skin with anti-collagen antibodies showed an abnormal distribution of collagen within the skin. No abnormality was detected in DNA extracted from lymphocytes taken from five family members, when probed with gene probes to collagen types alpha 1 (I), alpha 2 (I), alpha 1 (III) and alpha 2 (V)."
1693937	"A 34-year-old man with X-linked infantile hypogammaglobulinemia, bronchiectasis, and chronic liver disease had a papular eruption on the trunk and upper extremities. A biopsy specimen revealed caseating granulomas, but special stains, cultures, and electron microscopy failed to reveal an infectious organism. Immunohistochemistry showed that the lymphocytes within the granulomas were almost exclusively of the CD8+ cytotoxic/suppressor T phenotype. Phenotypic analysis of the circulating lymphocytes showed normal numbers of CD4+ (helper/inducer) and CD8+ T cells, whereas B cells were undetectable. Other examples of noninfectious granulomatous disease have been reported in patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia, but this is the first case of caseating cutaneous granulomatous disease to be reported in a patient with X-linked infantile hypogammaglobulinemia."
6799901	"A 38-year-old male suffered from swelling of the lower lip for 3 months. Neither facial nerve palsy nor fissuring of the tongue was present. Histological examination of a biopsy taken from the lower lip revealed non-caseous epithelioid cell granulomas, suggestive of cheilitis granulomatosa. Patch testing revealed positive reactions to mercury chloride and amalgam. His symptoms markedly improved 3 months after treatment of the apical periodontitis and replacement of dental crowns. As his dental crowns did not contain mercury, we believe that the cheilitis granulomatosa may have been related to the focal dental infection."
9031931	"The impact of psoriasis on patients' quality of life may be quite destructive, and measures of disease status alone seem to have questionable validity in describing the true burden of illness. Our aim was to study, in patients with psoriasis, the relationship between classical measures of clinical status (i.e., PASI and SAPASI) and quality-of-life indexes (i.e., Skindex-29, Dermatology Life Quality Index, Psoriasis Disability Index, Impact of Psoriasis Questionnaire). In addition, two psychological distress indexes (i.e., Psoriasis Life Stress Inventory, 12-item General Health Questionnaire) were assessed. Data were collected between February 2000 and July 2001 at the inpatient wards of the Dermatological Institute IDI-IRCCS, Rome, Italy, in the framework of a large project on clinical, epidemiologic, emotional, and quality-of-life aspects of psoriasis. A cluster analysis of all the above-mentioned instruments was conducted on 786 eligible patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of psoriasis. Correlations between instruments were also analyzed in subsets of patients based on the main variables of interest. The instruments clustered in two distinct groups, one formed by clinical severity measurements and the other grouping all the quality-of-life and psychological indexes. The correlations between instruments observed in the subgroups determined by different sociodemographic and clinical variables showed the same pattern. In conclusion, the dissimilarity between clinical severity assessment and patient-centered measures stresses the need for a more comprehensive assessment of severity of psoriasis."
2885564	"An 88-year-old man with a past medical history of pulmonary tuberculosis presented with a 2-year history of an indolent enlarging ulcerated nodule on his left wrist following a venous blood test. Skin biopsy of the ulcer showed granulomas, Ziehl-Neelsen stain was negative, and cultures grew Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Underlying bone and joint disease was excluded, and the lesion healed completely with 6 months of standard antituberculous treatment. We review the literature on tuberculous gumma following an injury."
3034685	"Cutaneous leishmaniasis is an endemic disease in developing countries caused by different species of leishmania parasite, and if left untreated, it will result in a deformed scar after a relatively long period. Although various systemic and topical treatments have been proposed for leishmaniasis, pentavalent Antimony compounds remain the first-line treatment for it. Considering the cases with treatment failure, potential side effects and reluctance of patients to receive the drug, there are continuing efforts to find better treatment alternatives.                                                                            Comparison of the effect of intralesional 2% zinc sulfate injection with Glucantime in treatment of acute cutaneous leishmaniasis.                                                                                            In this clinical trial, 45 patients with clinical diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis and positive direct smear for leishman body were treated by intralesional injection of either 2% zinc sulfate or Glucantime. After simple randomization, in one group the patients were treated with 2 bouts of intralesional 2% zinc sulfate with a 2-week interval, and in the other group they were treated with 6 weekly bouts of intralesional Glucantime. The patients were monitored in two week intervals for 8 weeks. Healing of the lesions was evaluated clinically and by direct smear, and the data were analyzed using SPSS (11.5) software, t-Student, Mann-Whitney and Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) statistical tests.                                                                               In the end of study, 34 patients completed the study, 10 of whom received intralesional Glucantime and 24 of whom received intralesional 2% zinc sulfate. The healing rate after 8 weeks was 80% in the group receiving intralesional Glucantime and 33.3% in the one receiving 2% zinc sulfate (P=0.009).                                                                                     Based on the results of this study, intralesional injection of 2% zinc sulfate was less effective in treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis than intralesional Glucantime."
5885290	"Early alternative donor HSCT is a potentially curative therapeutic option for patients with AAA not responding to IST. Seven patients (median age at diagnosis, 11 yr) with refractory AAA without a MSD underwent HSCT from matched unrelated (n = 6) or haploidentical (n = 1) donors. Conditioning regimens included CY (n = 7), muromonab-CD3/ATG (n = 7), TT (n = 6), FLU (n = 5), and TLI (n = 2). Grafts were either CD34 purified and/or CD3/19 depleted and contained a median of 10.17 × 10(6) /kg CD34 and 5.5 × 10(4) /kg CD3 cells. All patients engrafted rapidly. Median time to leukocyte engraftment was 10 days. With a median follow-up of 26 (range, 11-153) months, six patients are alive and well with complete donor hematopoiesis. One heavily pretreated patient developed GVHD grade III and died from progressive renal failure (resulting from microangiopathic hemolytic anemia) and disseminated aspergillosis. Early alternative donor HSCT can help to avoid complications from prolonged IST and presumably improve survival of patients with refractory AAA. Administration of high doses of CD34 purified and/or CD3/19 depleted stem cells following novel immunoablative conditioning may prevent graft rejection and GVHD. However, a long interval from diagnosis to HSCT seems to be associated with poor outcome."
6364931	"Osteoporosis is a well known side-effect of long-term treatment with glucocorticoids. However, the precise mechanism of this disorder is unclear. Recently, osteoprotegerin (OPG) [osteoclastogenesis inhibitory factor (OCIF)] has been identified as a novel cytokine, which inhibits differentiation and activation of osteoclast. In the present study, in order to clarify the roles of OPG in the development of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, we measured circulating OPG before and after glucocorticoid therapy.                                                                              The study subjects were 12 patients (five males, seven females, 53.4 +/- 4.8 [SE] years) with various renal diseases that required glucocorticoid therapy. All patients received glucocorticoids for the first time. Treatment was initiated at an average dose of 32.5 +/- 3.0 mg per day. Serum OPG was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Laboratory data, markers of bone metabolism and circulating OPG were compared before and after treatment for 4 weeks.                                                                              Serum OPG prior to glucocorticoid therapy was positively and independently correlated with serum creatinine. Serum OPG decreased significantly (P: <    0.0001) from 1.03 +/- 0.14 to 0.77 +/- 0.12 ng/ml after short-term administration of glucocorticoids. Furthermore, serum osteocalcin as a marker of bone formation was also reduced markedly (P: = 0.001). On the other hand, there were no remarkable changes in serum calcium, total alkaline phosphatases, creatinine and intact parathyroid hormone in response to glucocorticoid administration.                                                                                     These findings indicate that short-term administration of glucocorticoids significantly suppresses serum OPG and osteocalcin. It might participate in the development of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis via an enhancement of bone resorption and suppression of bone formation."
6153744	"The most important skin infections in Aboriginal communities in central and northern Australia are scabies and streptococcal pyoderma. Scabies is endemic in many remote Aboriginal communities, with prevalences in children up to 50%. The cycles of scabies transmission underlie much of the pyoderma. Up to 70% of children have skin sores, with group A streptococcus (GAS) the major pathogen. Group A streptococcus is responsible for the continuing outbreaks of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis and acute rheumatic fever (ARF). The cycles of scabies transmission in dogs and humans do not appear to significantly overlap. Guidelines have been developed for community control of scabies and skin sores and successful community initiated coordinated programmes have occurred. The anthropophilic dermatophyte Trichophyton rubrum is ubiquitous in many communities, again reflecting living conditions. Other skin infections related to the tropical environment include melioidosis, nocardiosis, Chromobacterium violaceum and chromoblastomycosis. Sustainable and long-term improvements in scabies, skin sores and GAS-related disease and tinea require fundamental changes that address social and economic inequities and, in particular, living conditions and overcrowding."
7796121	"Optimal preservation of the myocardium remains a major concern in clinical and experimental heart transplantation. The present study compared the efficacy of University of Wisconsin (UW) and Celsior preservation solution with respect to myocardial performance, epicardial and microvascular endothelial vasomotor function and myocardial expression of endothelin and nitric oxide synthases in humans. Forty-one cardiac transplant recipients received either UW (n = 20) or Celsior (n = 21) preserved hearts. Catecholamine and vasodilator requirements were assessed within the first 5 postoperative days. Left ventricular performance and endothelial function was assessed 1 month after transplantation. Endothelin and nitric oxide synthase gene expression were detected in myocardial biopsy samples. Celsior preserved hearts required significantly more catecholamines and vasodilators within the first 5 postoperative days. Myocardial performance and endothelial function were comparable 1 month after transplantation. Total ischemic time correlated with impaired endothelial function in the Celsior but not in the UW group. Endothelin and inducible nitric oxide synthase gene expression were significantly higher in the Celsior group. The results of the study show that both solutions provide myocardial protection with regard to left ventricular performance and endothelial function 1 month after cardiac transplantation. The necessity for higher vasodilator and catecholamine therapy in Celsior preserved hearts suggests post-ischemic myocardial stunning within the first 5 postoperative days. The positive correlation between impaired endothelial function and total ischemic time in the Celsior group requires longitudinal investigation in particular with regard to the development of allograft vasculopathy."
7541269	"Because of the many limitations of studies based on the diagnostic setting of excised lesions, the impact of dermoscopy (epiluminescence microscopy, dermatoscopy) in melanoma screening during practice remains to be established.                                                                                   We assumed that effects of the use of dermoscopy on some indicators of diagnostic performance in melanoma screening should be traceable retrospectively; therefore, we analysed the impact of routine dermoscopy use on the malignant/benign ratio in excised melanocytic lesions.                                                                              Preoperative and histological diagnosis of 3053 melanocytic lesions [319 melanomas (10.4%)] consecutively diagnosed and excised at the Department of Dermatology, University of Florence in the period 1997-2001 inclusive were retrieved. Six dermatologists who selected the lesions to excise and who performed preoperative diagnosis were divided into two groups according to their use of dermoscopy in routine activity (n = 2 dermoscopy users and n = 4 nonusers). The study period was divided into a predermoscopy period (1997), a shift phase (1998) and a dermoscopy period (1999-2001).                                                                              During the study period, the malignant/benign ratio improved in dermoscopy users only (from 1 : 18 to 1 : 4.3, P = 0.037). No significant difference was found for nonusers (from 1 : 11.8 to 1 : 14.4). Dermoscopy users were more likely to have a melanoma diagnosed within a series of excised lesions than nonusers, even taking into account potential confounders such as sex, age and study period by means of multivariate analysis (odds ratio 1.55, 95% confidence interval 1.17-2.01). The percentage of 'problem' naevi (naevi with architectural disorder with or without cytological atypia and Spitz or Reed naevi) over the total number of excised lesions was higher in dermoscopy users than in nonusers (year 2001, 51.6% vs. 40.9%, P = 0.014). Similar findings were obtained after exclusion from the data set of lesions excised for cosmetic reasons.                                                                                      The adoption of dermoscopy in routine melanoma screening is followed by an improvement of the malignant/benign ratio in excised lesions, suggesting a more appropriate selection of pigmented lesions referred to surgery. Because of the possible limitations of a retrospective study design, future confirmation of this finding by means of a prospective, randomized study is advisable. The introduction of dermoscopy in routine practice may have major implications in large-scale melanoma screening with cost savings and a reduction of the dermosurgery workload."
3087739	"Twenty-nine patients with severe atopic eczema were entered into a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the polypeptide thymus extract, thymostimulin (TP-1). The treatment period was 10 weeks with a subsequent follow-up period of up to 1 year. Of the 18 patients receiving TP-1 and the 11 patients on the placebo, 15 and 11 patients, respectively, were fully evaluable. There was no significant difference in either clinical or immunological status between the two treatment groups at baseline. At the 3-month follow-up clinic visit there was a statistically significant difference in the total clinical score, calculated as a percentage of baseline, in favour of the TP-1-treated patients. This difference was not maintained in the subsequent follow-up period and was not accompanied by an improvement in the patient's subjective well-being. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups with respect to the immunological parameters as measured at the 3-month clinic visit."
5113708	"Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto HSCT) has become the standard treatment for patients with relapsed diffuse large-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) responding to conventional salvage chemotherapy. Nevertheless, more than half of these patients will relapse following auto HSCT and die. This study was undertaken to determine whether the International Prognostic Index (IPI) assessed at time of relapse (IPI-R) could be used to identify patients with greater probability for long-term survival following auto HSCT. Eighty patients, median age 47 years (range 19-68 years), with diffuse large cell lymphoma in either second complete remission (CR 2, n = 27) or partial remission (PR 2, n = 53) were treated between 1984 and 2002 with auto HSCT. Clinical features predictive of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed. Post-auto HSCT, CR was achieved in 73 patients (91%). With a median follow-up of 5 years (range 1.0-14.2 years), OS and PFS at 5 years were 38% (95% confidence interval [CI] 27%-50%) and 32% (95% CI 22%-42%), respectively. Two risk groups with significantly different OS and PFS were identified by the IPI-R. The high-risk group (3, 4, or 5 IPI factors) had 2.0 times (95% CI 1.1-4.0, P = .03) the risk of death and 2.2 times (95% CI 1.2-4.0, P = .01) the risk of relapse as the low-risk group (0, 1, or 2 IPI factors). The median OS was 5 months versus 27 months and the median PFS was 2 months versus 8 months for the high- and low-risk IPI-R groups, respectively. In Cox regression analysis, high-risk IPI-R status (relative risk [RR] 2.4, 95% CI 1.2-4.8, P = .02) and bone marrow (BM) involvement at diagnosis (RR 2.9, 95% CI 1.3-6.4, P = .01) were independent predictors for poor OS. Similarly, high-risk IPI-R status (RR 2.5, 95% CI 1.3-4.7, P = .01) and BM involvement at diagnosis (RR 3.9, 95% CI 1.7-8.7, P = .001) were independent predictors for poor PFS. These results suggest that the IPI-R predicts OS and PFS following auto HSCT for patients with aggressive NHL in CR 2 or PR 2. Patients with high-risk IPI-R should be considered for novel therapeutic approaches."
7272647	"Primary liver allograft nonfunction immediately after transplantation poses a life-threatening situation for the recipient. Emergency retransplantation may not be immediately possible due to organ unavailability. Total hepatectomy with temporary portacaval shunt has been described as a bridge to retransplantation when the presence of the graft appears to be harming the recipient. Case reports of retransplantation after total hepatectomy with anhepatic times greater than 48 hours routinely describe poor outcomes. We present a case with excellent patient outcome after 95 hours of clinical anhepatic state, including 67 hours of anatomical anhepatic time, because of primary liver allograft nonfunction. This case report documents the longest anhepatic time with subsequent successful transplant to date."
7488765	"Six cell surface glycoproteins defined by monoclonal antibodies were selected for study on human epidermal cells. In tests on tissue sections, three of the glycoproteins [J143 (gp140/30); T43 (gp85/36); H99 (gp38)] were expressed in the basal cell layer of the epidermis, whereas the other three glycoproteins [T179 (gp140/95); T16 (gp40/50); BT15 (gp80)] were preferentially expressed in maturing keratinocytes above the basal layer. We compared synthesis of these glycoproteins in fresh epidermis and in primary epidermal short term cultures using [35S]methionine for metabolic labeling. Synthesis of J143 was 8- to 20-fold higher and synthesis of T43 was 4- to 10-fold lower in cultured cells compared with fresh epidermis. BT15, an antigen strongly expressed on terminally differentiating keratinocytes, was synthesized at 5- to 15-fold higher levels in fresh epidermis than in cultured cells. Biosynthesis levels of H99, T179, and T16 did not change in cultured epidermal cells. Based on our findings, we propose a model of surface antigenic changes that occur during keratinocyte differentiation in vivo."
7777324	"Photodynamic therapy is a non-invasive technique used in the treatment of skin diseases which has various advantages, one being the ability to localize treatment to the area being treated, which is common among most photosensitizers. Aminolevulinic acid is a prodrug that is metabolized intracellularly to form the photosensitizing molecule protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). When PpIX is activated by light, cytotoxic reactive oxygen species and free radicals are generated. This phototoxic effect may cause malignant and non-malignant hyperproliferative tissue to be destroyed, to decrease in size, and to eventually disappear. The application of topical aminolevulinic acid 20% followed by the use of a blue light photodynamic therapy illuminator is indicated in the US for the treatment of non-hyperkeratotic actinic keratoses of the face or scalp. There are data suggesting that aminolevulinic acid/photodynamic therapy may also be beneficial in acne vulgaris, verrucae, psoriasis, mycosis fungoides, and human papillomavirus. This treatment modality has also proven effective in the management of skin cancer such as, Bowen disease and basal cell carcinoma. Further experience in the use of photodynamic therapy will help define its utility in the management of actinic keratosis and other dermatoses."
9755292	"Many authors have described cytologic features in a variety of melanocytic lesions but, to our knowledge, a statistical analysis of sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of these features alone or in combination has not been performed.                                                                                  We sought to determine the diagnostic value of nuclear and cytoplasmic characteristics in the diagnosis of melanocytic lesions via multivariate statistical analysis.                                                                              This is a retrospective observational study conducted on 300 melanocytic lesions. We evaluated a series of distinctive features; subsequently a multivariate model was used to determine sensitivity and specificity.                                                                              Major features that favor a diagnosis of melanoma include: pleomorphism with enlarged nuclei, mitotic figures, notching/corrugation of the nuclear envelope, and peppered moth nucleus. Features with intermediate value include: solid hyperchromasia, vesicular nucleus with single round nucleolus, and nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio greater than 4:1.                                                                                      Limitations of this study include its retrospective nature, and the reliance on the original diagnostic classification of each neoplasm.                                                                                     Our data suggest that some nuclear alterations have greater value in the diagnosis of benign and malignant melanocytic lesions."
6149593	"1. The use of CsA in cadaver donor transplants has apparently overcome the effect of original disease one-year graft survival rates. Only SLE patients had lower than average graft survival rates in CsA-treated, first transplants. 2. Since 1970, the proportion of diabetics transplanted has increased tenfold. The proportions of transplants for glomerulonephritis and pyelonephritis have decreased over the years. 3. A beneficial effect of pretransplant blood transfusions, was observed in almost all of the disease groups. 4. HLA matching, particularly for HLA-B, DR antigens, has resulted in increased graft survival rates in the major disease categories. Small numbers of zero mismatched grafts prevented a more detailed analysis. 5. Whereas CsA consistently enhanced graft survival rates for first cadaver transplants, this drug had a much smaller effect in living donor transplants. A 14% increase was seen in cadaver donor transplants due to CsA, compared to 2% (siblings), 1% (parent), and 4% (child) for the living donor grafts."

Subsequently, the patient developed classic cardiac and arthritic manifestations. Skin biopsy is recommended for the early diagnosis of rheumatic fever."
2077931	"Human synovial mast cells (MC) can be immunolabelled with antihuman CXCR3 antibody (Ab) (clone 49801). We have investigated whether cutaneous and mucosal MC are stained with anti-CXCR3 Ab in paraffin-embedded sections. Immunohistochemical staining and immunofluorescence double staining assays were performed with anti-CXCR3, anti-tryptase, and anti-chymase Ab using normal skin, psoriatic skin lesions, and normal colon. When compared with tryptase and chymase staining, 100% of the cutaneous and 98% of the mucosal MC were positive for CXCR3. Anti-CXCR3 staining is a useful marker for human cutaneous and mucosal MC in paraffin-embedded sections."
2179490	"There are no large studies of Bowen's disease that have analyzed its distribution according to age, sex, and site.                                                                                  This study was performed primarily to determine whether there were significant sex and site differences in the distribution of Bowen's disease.                                                                              One thousand one skin biopsy specimens of Bowen's disease were analyzed according to age, sex, and site of origin.                                                                              This study revealed that the most common site of Bowen's disease was the head and neck (440 lesions), whereas specimens from the lower limbs (298 lesions) and upper limbs (198 lesions) outnumbered specimens from the torso (65 lesions). Of 298 specimens from the lower limbs, 72.1% were from women; 79.3% of the 87 specimens from the scalp and ears were from men. Eighty percent of the 85 specimens of Bowen's disease from the cheeks were from women.                                                                                     These results indicate that cutaneous Bowen's disease occurs mainly on sun-exposed sites. This is also supported by the predominance of Bowen's disease on the lower limbs in women and on the scalp and ears in men. The basis for the female predominance on the cheeks is unknown, but may reflect the increased vulnerability to sun damage of superficial vellus hair follicles that predominate on the cheeks in women. This finding may provide indirect support for the hypothesis that some forms of Bowen's disease have a follicular histogenesis."
8451188	"We report the identification and functional analysis of TRANSPARENT LEAF AREA1 (TLA1), a maize (Zea mays) gene representing a novel class of secreted, extremely hydrophobic peptides (proteolipids) with a C-terminal Caax box-like motif. ZmTLA1 encodes 27 amino acid residues and is most strongly expressed in the egg cell and microspores. Lower transcript amounts were detected during vegetative development. Transgenic maize expressing an antisense transcript displayed a variety of phenotypes. The most visible phenotypes were dwarfism and transparent leaf areas resulting from defective morphogenesis of mesophyll, bundle sheath, stomatal, and epidermal cells during leaf development. Incomplete cell walls were observed, indicating a defect of cytokinesis. The accumulation of gerontoplasts was probably a secondary effect caused by defects of leaf cell morphogenesis. A defect of anther maturation was observed in approximately 30% of the plants displaying the tla phenotype. Male sterility was mainly caused by incomplete disintegration of the tapetal cell layers and tetrad callose as 90% of the microspores developed into functional pollen. Overexpression of ZmTLA1 seemed to have a lethal effect both in maize and Arabidopsis thaliana. Development of primary roots, root hairs, primary leaves, and chloroplasts was suppressed in Arabidopsis seedlings expressing an inducible ZmTLA1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein. GFP signals were exclusively detected in cell walls. Based on our observations, we suggest that the ZmTLA1 peptide represents a class of novel plant morphogens required for the development and maturation of leaf and reproductive tissues."
4050650	"In this study we report the case of a 28-year-old female patient with recurrent lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) in the allografts after bilateral living-donor lobar lung transplantation. Although her post-operative course under immunosuppression with tacrolimus and prednisolone had been uneventful without rejection episodes, she had developed shortness of breath and a progressive chylous effusion with diffuse cystic changes in both lungs 5 years after transplantation. In spite of a diagnosis of having a recurrence of LAM based on radiologic findings and deteriorating pulmonary function, her clinical symptoms, which included dyspnea and chylothorax, were significantly improved after treatment with sirolimus. Although a beneficial effect of sirolimus in the treatment of LAM has not been definitively determined, this report may provide useful information for management of recurrent LAM after lung transplantation."
7292504	"Calcium hydroxylapatite (CaHA) is presently approved for the correction of moderate to severe facial wrinkles and folds and signs of HIV-associated facial lipoatrophy.                                                                                  This 6-month pilot study was designed to evaluate clinical efficacy and patient satisfaction of CaHA to treat mid-face volume loss.                                                                              Nineteen patients received initial malar injections of CaHA. At 1, 3, and 6 months, patients were evaluated for mid-face volume loss, satisfaction, and adverse events. Touch ups were administered at 3 months, with enhancement injections permitted at 6 months.                                                                              Average treatment volumes were 1.3 mL CaHA gel per side. At 1, 3, and 6 months, 88%, 74%, and 75% of patients rated themselves ""very satisfied/satisfied"" and physicians rated 82%, 100%, and 94% of patients as ""im proved"" or greater, respectively. Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) scores were similar. At 6 months, 88% of patients were pleased with the outcome and 81% would recommend CaHA cheek augmentation.                                                                                      Malar augmentation with CaHA gel appears to be a viable nonsurgical alternative for patients with mid-face volume loss, with good patient satisfaction and excellent tolerability."
3029948	"The first aim of this study is to compare the outcomes in rehabilitating the atrophic maxilla using zygomatic implants (ZIs) and regular implants (RIs) using the classical zygomatic technique (CZT) versus the zygomatic anatomy-guided approach (ZAGA). The second goal of this paper is to propose a standardized system to report rhinosinusitis diagnosis.                                                                                            Twenty-two consecutive zygomatic patients operated on from 1998 to 2002 and 80 consecutive zygomatic patients operated on from 2004 to October 2009 were selected. All included patients were in a maintenance program. Survival rates (SRs) of ZI and RI were recorded. Implants were individually tested using Periotest® (Periotest value [PTv], Siemens AG, Bensheim, UK). Sinus health was radiographically and clinically assessed according to Lund-Mackay system and Lanza and Kennedy survey recommended by Task Force on Rhinosinusitis for research outcomes. A satisfaction questionnaire (Oral Health Impact Profile for assessing health-related quality of life in Edentulous adults) and different anatomical measurements were also performed.                                                                              No significant differences (p = .602) were observed with respect to SR between the two groups (95.12% vs 96.79%). Significant differences (p = .000) were found comparing measurements of ZI head distance to the alveolar crest (5.12 ± 2.38 mm vs 2.92 ± 2.30 mm). With the CZT, more palatal emergence of ZI was observed. PTv gave significantly greater stability for the CZT compared with the ZAGA group in both measurements (-4.38 ± 1.75 vs -2.49 ± 4.31, p = .000; -4.94 ± 1.46 vs -3.11 ± 5.06, p = .000). Lund-Mackay score was significantly lower for the ZAGA group (2.38 ± 3.86 vs 0.56 ± 1.26, p = .042). Statistically significant difference (p = .047) regarding the percentage of patients with no signs or symptoms of rhinosinusitis (Lanza and Kennedy test negative and Lund-Mackay score zero) was observed between groups (54.55% vs 76.25%, p = .047).                                                                                      Both procedures had similar clinical outcomes with respect to implant survival. The ZAGA concept is able to immediately rehabilitate the severely atrophic maxillae, minimizing the risk of maxillary sinus-associated pathology. Moreover, less bulky, more comfortable, and easy to clean prostheses are achieved."
9604687	"After liver transplantation for cancer, there is a high incidence of disease recurrence within 18 to 36 months for most tumors, although there are a small number of long-term survivors. An extended resection of the upper abdominal viscera with replacement by a liver-pancreas cluster is being tried in Pittsburgh for lesions which have not been successfully managed with liver transplantation alone. Despite a high incidence of graft reinfection after liver transplantation for hepatitis B virus (HBV) related disease, a significant proportion of patients achieve long-term survival. Hyperimmune globulin and interferon have been of little benefit in preventing reinfection. Clinical trials with a human monoclonal antibody to HBsAg are in progress. Transplantation for alcoholic liver disease has been considered controversial. However, survival after liver transplantation for Laennec's cirrhosis is comparable to survival after liver transplantation for other chronic, benign, and non-HBV related liver diseases. Sclerotherapy followed by liver transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with acute hemorrhage from esophageal varices and end-stage liver disease. Sclerotherapy alone or followed by selective shunting is an appropriate alternative in patients with good hepatic reserve. Only 25% of infants with biliary atresia benefit from portoenterostomy. To meet the demand for small infants waiting for transplantation, several transplant programs have successfully expanded their efforts to use partial (reduced) liver grafts. Cyclosporine and low-dose prednisone remain the basis for immunosuppression after liver transplantation. However, nephrotoxicity and hypertension are frequent and troublesome side effects of cyclosporine. Triple and quadruple drug regimens have been increasingly popular in an effort to minimize cyclosporine toxicity. Phase 1 clinical trials with a new drug, FK506, recently began in Pittsburgh. Hyperacute rejection of the liver has been demonstrated in animal models and has been strongly suspected in recent clinical descriptions of acute hemorrhagic necrosis after liver transplantation. So far, only transplantation across an ABO incompatibility has been identified as a risk factor for hyperacute rejection. The new preservation solution developed by Belzer and associates at the University of Wisconsin has significantly extended the preservation time for liver grafts, and improved the quality of liver preservation."

One thousand and sixty-five patients were randomized to treatment in 3 multicenter, randomized, investigator-blinded, 6-week studies.                                                                              Based on the Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI), tacrolimus ointment was more effective than pimecrolimus cream at the end of the study in adults (54.1% vs. 34.9%, respectively; P <    .0001), in children with moderate/severe disease (67.2% vs. 56.4%, respectively; P = .04), in the combined analysis (52.8% vs. 39.1%, respectively; P <    .0001), and at week 1 in children with mild disease (39.2% vs. 31.2%, respectively; P = .04). Tacrolimus was also more effective than pimecrolimus based on the Investigator Global AD Assessment (IGADA), improvement in percentage of total body surface area affected, and improvement in itch scores (P <    or = .05), with a faster onset of action. There was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse events (AEs), including application site reactions in the 2 studies involving 650 children. Adults treated with tacrolimus experienced a greater number of local application site reactions on day 1; both groups reported a similar incidence of application site reactions thereafter. More pimecrolimus-treated patients than tacrolimus-treated patients withdrew from the studies because of a lack of efficacy (P <    or = .03) or adverse events (P = .002; pediatric mild).                                                                                     Tacrolimus ointment is more effective and has a faster onset of action than pimecrolimus cream in adults and children with AD; their safety profiles are similar."
7131468	"Organ transplantation has become a valuable and accepted treatment for many patients with organ failure. A major limitation to transplantation is the shortage of organ donors. Due to lack of willingness by medical examiners to release child abuse cases for organ donation, child abuse victims are a greatly underutilized pool of potential donors. This paper presents a model to facilitate organ recovery in the child abuse victim. This protocol has been in consistent use in San Diego County since midyear 1991. In all cases of child abuse where the victim was brain dead and the family consented to organ donation, the medical examiner's office released the body for organ donation. Since institution of the model described in this paper, organ donation among child abuse victims has risen dramatically in San Diego County. If similar protocols are established at other pediatric centers, the disparity between supply and demand in pediatric organ donation will diminish."
9403972	"The infusion of flowers of several species of Citrus genera is used as a sedative to treat insomnia in Mexican traditional medicine. The aims of this study were to investigate the sedative effect of different extracts of flowers of Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck (Rutaceae) and describe the pharmacological action mechanism of the sedative active compounds of this plant. The methanol and dichloromethane extracts, obtained from the flowers of Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck (Rutaceae), showed a dose-dependent sedative effect in the exploratory cylinder model in mice, with ED50 (ip) values of 47.04+/-12.03 mg/kg and 129.15+/-21.25 mg/kg, respectively. Hesperidin (ED50=11.34+/-2.48 mg/kg) was identified in the methanol extract as the sedative active principle of this plant. The pre-treatment with atropine (1 mg/kg I. P.), flumazenil (2 mg/kg I. P.), clonidine (0.01 mg/kg I. P.), isoproterenol (0.3 mg/kg I. P.), haloperidol (0.3 mg/kg I. P.), WAY 100 635 (3 mg/kg I. P.), P-chlorophenylalanine (250 mg/kg I. P., twice per day for 2 days), forskolin (3 mg/kg I. P.) and rolipram (0.173 mg/kg I. P.) did not modify the sedative effect of 30 mg/kg hesperidin. However, the sedative effect of this compound was potentiated by yohimbine (1.25 mg/kg I. P.) and buspirone (1 mg/kg I. P.), and reverted by pretreatment with aminophylline (30 mg/kg I. P.), caffeine (30 mg/kg I. P.) and several doses of 1,3-dimethyl-8-phenylxanthine (10, 30 and 54.7 mg/kg I. P.). These results suggest that adenosine receptors might be involved in the sedative action of hesperidin, identified as the active principle of the flowers of Citrus sinensis."
8290841	"Experimental studies have demonstrated that the intensity of alloreactivity against a transplanted organ results from an interaction of positive (CD40/CD40L and B.7/CD28) and inhibitory (B.7/CTLA-4) signals between antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and T lymphocytes.                                                                              We examined the CD40L, CD28, and both surface (s) and intracellular (i) CTLA-4 expressions on freshly drawn and anti-CD3+rIL-2-stimulated peripheral blood CD4+ T cells in groups of kidney transplant recipients in relation to distinct clinical course using the tri-color immunofluorescence method.                                                                              The median proportions of freshly isolated CD3+/CD4+/CTLA-4+ and CD3+/CD4+/CD40L+ cells in all groups of graft recipients were higher than in control subjects. In patients with stable graft function (SGF), non-significantly higher sCTLA-4, significantly higher iCTLA-4 expression, and significantly lower CD40L expression on freshly drawn CD4+ T cells compared with recipients with chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) were found. Moreover, CD4+ T cells from SGF patients showed a higher potential to express sCTLA-4 and CD40L molecules and to down-regulate the CD28 molecule in response to ex vivo stimulation than those from patients with CAN. In patients without acute graft rejection (NAGR), a markedly higher proportion of freshly drawn CD3+/CD4+/iCTLA-4+ cells compared with patients with acute graft rejection (AGR) and an up-regulation of the median percentage of CD3+/CD4+/CD40L+ cells after ex vivo stimulation was found.                                                                                      In patients with SGF, peripheral blood CD4+ T cells exhibited a higher potential to express surface CTLA-4 and CD40L and to down-regulate CD28 costimulatory molecules in response to ex vivo stimulation, indicating a relationship between the expression patterns of both costimulatory and inhibitory molecules in CD4+ T cells and clinical course after renal transplantation."
1369813	"Ultrasonography (US) is an attractive alternative for invasive studies to evaluate venous patency. However, little data exist concerning the usefulness of US in patients undergoing bowel transplantation. Twenty-five adult patients with bowel transplantation were retrospectively identified with both US and contrast venography (VG) performed preoperatively. The median age was 43 yr, and the median duration of total parenteral nutrition was 36 months. The vessels were evaluated as positive with ≥ 50% stenosis. Among the internal jugular veins and the subclavian veins examined with US (96% of the all sites) and with VG (69%), 66 venous sites were available for comparison. VG confirmed positive in 42% (28/66), while US found positive in 27% (18/66); US had three false positives and 13 false negatives, giving the sensitivity of 54% (95% confidence interval [CI], 34-72) and the specificity of 92% (CI, 77-98). The positive and the negative likelihood ratios weighted by prevalence (42%) were 5 (CI, 1.7-14.3) and 0.37 (CI, 0.23-0.60), respectively. In addition, VG confirmed stenosis in 32% of the right and 50% of the left brachiocephalic veins and 41% of the superior vena cava. US is not a reliable method for assessing the upper body venous system of patients undergoing bowel transplantation."
7603312	"Because vertical ridge augmentation with autogenous bone blocks carries with it a risk of graft resorption and donor site morbidity, the aim of the present study was to compare histologically the healing following vertical ridge augmentation using screwable, xenogenous deproteinized blocks or autologous bone blocks in dogs.                                                                                            Standardized vertical mandibular defects were surgically created in edentulous ridges of six foxhounds. Two bone blocks (6 x 10 x 15 mm) were inserted on each mandibular side and fixed with both a titanium implant and an osteosynthetic screw. Three different therapies were tested: (1) xenogenous block alone; (2) xenogenous block, covered with a chemically cross-linked collagen membrane; and (3) autologous blocks, harvested during defect preparation. After 3 months of submerged healing, the miniscrews were removed and replaced by dental implants. Following an additional healing period of 3 months, the animals were sacrificed, and dissected blocks were prepared for histomorphometric analysis.                                                                              During the primary healing period, three of 12 hemimandibles (six blocks) had to be removed because of severe inflammatory reactions (two xenogenous block sites with collagen membrane, one autologous block site). In general, histologic analysis revealed that xenogenous blocks, used alone or combined with a collagen membrane, exhibited osteoconductive properties on a level equivalent to that of autologous blocks, resulting in means of 50% to 60% of ossification of the blocks. Some parts of the xenograft were encased in soft tissue, partly surrounded by multinuclear giant cells. However, all groups showed obvious signs of bone/graft resorption.                                                                                      Within the limits of the present study, it was concluded that the examined screwable xenogenous bone block might be a useful scaffold for ridge augmentation procedures. However, the combination of xenogenous blocks with a cross-linked collagen membrane did not appear to improve outcomes."

The latter is found for the first time in this region to be a cause of ringworm in humans."
2212385	"New immunosuppressive therapies are currently being developed in renal transplantation and their relative risk in terms of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) must be carefully evaluated. For this purpose, a French registry of PTLD occurring after renal transplantation was set up. Among 10,000 patients presently followed up in 30 French renal transplantation centers, we prospectively identified 53 new PTLD (0.5%) since January 1998. Patients (34 male, 19 female) ranged from 3 to 72 years (mean age: 46 years), and the median time between grafting and diagnosis of PTLD was 63 months (2 months to 14 years). Ninety percent of recipients were Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positive before transplantation. Most patients received a quadruple sequential therapy with polyclonal anti-lymphocyte globulin. Sites involved in PTLD were isolated lymph nodes in 13 cases, stomach or bowel in 10 cases, allograft in 14 cases, central nervous system in 6 cases, oropharynx in 4 cases, and skin or mucosa in 4 cases. Only three PTLD expressed markers of T lineage. Out of 40 studied tumors, 31 (78%) were EBV positive. Tumors were classified as polymorph in 26 cases and monomorph in 23 cases. Genotype studies in 18 PTLD showed a monoclonal pattern in 13 cases. In most patients, treatment consisted of reduction of immune suppression, 21 patients were given additional anti-viral therapy, 13 patients had anti-CD20, 23 patients underwent chemotherapy, and 4 patients were given cerebral radiotherapy. Five patients underwent transplantectomy. Sixteen patients (30%) died within the 1st year and 7 patients returned to dialysis (13%). The outcome of patients with PTLD remains poor, and the optimal approach to therapy is largely unknown. This ongoing registry is not only a national observatory but also a task force designed to improve the treatment strategy of PTLD."

In both patients, varying degrees of spontaneous regression occurred. A conservative approach to management of these lesions is suggested."
4993140	"Allograft adaptation to a foreign circulation is imperfect as noted from persistent limitations to stress. Effective arterial elastance (Ea), a measure of afterload, provides an estimate of aortic impedance. End systolic elastance (Ees) is a load-independent measure of ventricular performance as well as its interaction in the periphery. The ratio (Ea to Ees) characterizes ventricular-vascular coupling; a value close to unity signifies poor mechanical efficiency. The purpose of this investigation was to correlate mechanical efficiency of work with expression of B-type natriuretic peptide BNP, a specific marker of ventricular stress and strain.                                                                              We measured BNP levels in 40 consecutive stable heart transplant recipients free from rejection. In addition, echocardiography was performed to obtain Ea, Ees, and their ratio (Ea to Ees) by the single-beat method. We examined correlates of BNP expression by assessing Ea to Ees, while correcting for mean arterial pressure, body mass index, left ventricular mass index, ejection fraction, and serum creatinine.                                                                              BNP levels were significantly and positively correlated (r=0.38, P=.05) with an increased Ea to Ees ratio. By multivariable analysis, this relationship persisted independently (t=2.1, P=.04), while the five other measures were insignificant predictors.                                                                                     This investigation indicated that the transplanted heart demonstrates poor contractile efficiency and operates at maximal left ventricular work. This is paralleled by a tandem increase in BNP, suggesting that elevation in this stress peptide is at least partly explained by ventriculo-vascular uncoupling in heart transplantation, independent of alterations in blood pressure."
4310380	"Uridine 5'-diphosphate (UDP)-glucose is transported into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and the Arabidopsis nucleotide sugar transporter AtUTr1 has been proposed to play a role in this process; however, different lines of evidence suggest that another transporter(s) may also be involved. Here we show that AtUTr3 is involved in the transport of UDP-glucose and is located at the ER but also at the Golgi. Insertional mutants in AtUTr3 showed no obvious phenotype. Biochemical analysis in both AtUTr1 and AtUTr3 mutants indicates that uptake of UDP-glucose into the ER is mostly driven by these two transporters. Interestingly, the expression of AtUTr3 is induced by stimuli that trigger the unfolded protein response (UPR), a phenomenon also observed for AtUTr1, suggesting that both AtUTr1 and AtUTr3 are involved in supplying UDP-glucose into the ER lumen when misfolded proteins are accumulated. Disruption of both AtUTr1 and AtUTr3 causes lethality. Genetic analysis showed that the atutr1 atutr3 combination was not transmitted by pollen and was poorly transmitted by the ovules. Cell biology analysis indicates that knocking out both genes leads to abnormalities in both male and female germ line development. These results show that the nucleotide sugar transporters AtUTr1 and AtUTr3 are required for the incorporation of UDP-glucose into the ER, are essential for pollen development and are needed for embryo sac progress in Arabidopsis thaliana."
1387909	"Atrichia with papular lesions (APL) (MIM 209 500) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by early onset of atrichia, followed by a papular eruption within the first years of life. Recent studies demonstrating linkage to chromosome 8p21 and further mutation detection in the hairless gene (HR) have established the molecular basis of APL. This study describes the case of a 16-year-old female with APL due to a missense mutation, D1012N, in the hr-thyroid hormone receptor interacting domain 2 (TRID2) of the HR. Using functional and biochemical analysis, it was determined that this mutation does not significantly affect hr-thyroid hormone receptor interaction. This result suggests that the TRID2 domain either is dispensable in the hr-TR interaction or is not involved in the pathogenesis of APL."

6908285	"Symphonia globulifera has been widely used in traditional medicine and has therefore been subjected to several phytochemical studies in the American and African continents. Interestingly, some disparities have been observed concerning its metabolic profile. Several phytochemical studies of S. globulifera have led to the identification of more than 40 compounds, including several polycyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinols. Biological evaluations have pointed out the promising biological activities of these secondary metabolites, mostly as antiparasitic or antimicrobial, confirming the traditional use of this plant. The purpose of this review is to describe the natural occurrence, botanical aspects, ethnomedicinal use, structure, and biogenesis, as well as biological activities of compounds isolated from this species according to their provenance."
7476353	"There are 40 vascularized composite allotransplant programs across 5 continents served by 31 organ procurement organizations (or equivalent). The organizations' websites inform about organ and tissue donation. This research explored worldwide educational efforts on vascularized composite allograft (VCAG) donation via their corporate websites as well as options within donor registries and donor card systems to indicate a VCAG donation preference. Of these, 13 (41.9%) of 31 had VCAG content and 7 (22.6%) of 31 offered a mechanism for individuals to voice a preference about VCAG donation through an opt in donor registry or card or an opt out registry. In North America, the only donor registration/card system that facilitated VCAG donation is in Mexico. The resistance to consent for VACG donation is likely due to poor public education and the personal nature of face, hand, uterus, and penile allografts. Efforts to reduce this resistance can begin with the assistance of website content, registries, and donor cards."
1378592	"Of the patients with epidermal nevi, 10-18% may have disorders of the eye, nervous, and musculoskeletal systems. A predisposition to malignant neoplasms in ectodermal and mesodermal structures may also be found. There are six different epidermal nevus syndromes described so far: Proteus, congenital hemidysplasia with ichthyosiform nevus and limb defect syndrome, phakomatosis pigmentokeratotica, sebaceous nevus, Becker nevus, and nevus comedonicus. Thirty-five patients with epidermal nevus syndrome seen at the National Institute of Pediatrics in Mexico City during a 31-year period are described. This syndrome represented 7.9% of 443 patients with epidermal nevi; its relative frequency was 1 case per 11,928 pediatric patients and 1 case per 1080 dermatologic patients. Nine epidermal nevus syndrome patients (26%) had Proteus syndrome. Sebaceous nevus syndrome was found in six patients (17%), while the nevus comedonicus syndrome was found in three (8%). Two patients were diagnosed with phakomatosis pigmentokeratotica and one patient with congenital hemidysplasia with ichthyosiform nevus and limb defect syndrome. This is the first report of phakomatosis pigmentokeratotica and congenital hemidysplasia with ichthyosiform nevus and limb defect syndrome in Mexican patients. One patient had an inflammatory linear verrucous epidermal nevus with systemic involvement. Thirteen patients (37%) had keratinocytic nevi with systemic involvement. We propose the keratinocytic nevus syndrome to be defined as the association of a keratinocytic nevus with neuronal migration and/or musculoskeletal disorders in addition to a higher risk for mesodermal neoplasms."
8172880	"Long-term (>   1 year) placebo-controlled studies of tretinoin in the treatment of photodamaged skin have not been conducted. Recently, we conducted a 2-year placebo-controlled study of tretinoin emollient cream 0.05%, including histopathologic assessment of safety and analysis of markers of collagen deposition.                                                                                  The objective of the study was to determine the long-term safety and efficacy of tretinoin emollient cream 0.05% in the treatment of moderate to severe facial photodamage.                                                                              A total of 204 subjects were treated with tretinoin or placebo (vehicle emollient cream) applied to the entire face once a day for up to 2 years. Clinical and histologic effects were assessed at regularly scheduled clinic visits.                                                                              Treatment with tretinoin resulted in significantly greater improvement relative to placebo in clinical signs of photodamage (fine and coarse wrinkling, mottled hyperpigmentation, lentigines, and sallowness), overall photodamage severity, and investigator's global assessment of clinical response (p<   0.05). Histologic evaluation showed no increase in keratinocytic or melanocytic atypia, dermal elastosis, or untoward effects on stratum corneum following treatment with tretinoin compared with placebo. Immunohistochemistry studies, conducted at three study centers, showed a significant increase relative to placebo in facial procollagen 1C terminal, a marker for procollagen synthesis, at month 12 (p=0.0074).                                                                                     Long-term treatment with tretinoin emollient cream 0.05% is safe and effective in subjects with moderate to severe facial photodamage."
5895504	"This work presents the first report that A. rugosa could have tyrosinase and melanogenesis inhibition and that its activities also be improved by fermentation with Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus paracasei. It was found that the tyrosinase and melanogenesis inhibition was correlated with antioxidant activity of acacetin, the major biologically active substances in A. rugosa.                                                                             we pursued an improvement in tyrosinase and melanogenesis inhibition of A. rugosa extract by fermentation process.                                                                              A. rugosa was extracted by lactic acid fermentation process; we measured antioxidant activities and tyrosinase and melanogenesis inhibition of A. rugosa extracts.                                                                             In particular, reducing power of the extract from fermentation process (FE) was measured as 0.562 (O.D.), whereas reducing power of the extracts from 70% ethanol extraction (EE) was lower than the FE as 0.496 (O.D.). Polyphenols and flavonoids in the FE were higher than the EE: 69.3 mg/g vs. 60.5 mg/g, and 187 mg/g vs. 138 mg/g. The FE was estimated as 51.04% tyrosinase inhibition and 41.88% for the EE. Similarly, melanin inhibition in melanocyte B16F10 was observed as 66.60% vs. 42.23% for the FE and EE. The increase in tyrosinase and melanogenesis inhibition activity was confirmed by high elution of acacetin through fermentation process such as 289.97 mg/100 g vs. 198.04 mg/100 g in the FE and EE.                                                                                     These results indicate that tyrosinase and melanogenesis inhibition activities of the extracts should be associated with antioxidant activity because acacetin is known to have strong antioxidant activity, which can also positively affect whitening activities."

9048717	"Mono-L-aspartyl chlorin e6 (NPe6) is a photosensitizer that exhibits chemical purity, absorption at 664 nm wavelength and may be useful in photodynamic therapy (PDT).                                                                              This open label phase I clinical trial at the University of California, Davis Medical Center examined the pharmacokinetic properties of Npe6 and clinical response to PDT with this photosensitizer. A single intravenous dose of Npe6 was administered to 14 cancer patients with superficial malignancies (basal cell carcinoma = 22 lesions, squamous cell cancer = 13 lesions, papillary carcinoma = 14 lesions). Patients received one of five ascending doses (0.5 mg/kg (n = 4), 1.0 mg/kg (n = 3), 1.65 mg/kg (n = 3), 2.5 mg/kg (n = 3), or 3.5 mg/kg (n = 1)) 4-8 h prior to light activation. The total light dose (range 25-200 J/cm2) depended on the tumor shape and size. Light was delivered using an argon-pumped tunable dye laser. Serum NPe6 concentrations were measured over a 28-day period. The toxicity and cutaneous clinical efficacy of NPe6 were observed.                                                                              Four weeks post-PDT, 20 of 22 basal cell carcinoma tumors (91%) showed a complete response. Eighteen of 27 other malignant cutaneous tumors showed a complete (n = 15/27, 56%) or partial (n = 3/27, 11%) response. Fewer non-responders were seen at an Npe6 dose level of 1.65 mg/kg or higher. Only 2 of 14 patients experienced an adverse event that was definitely related to NPe6 administration. Photosensitivity resolved within 1 week of NPe6 dosing in 12 of 14 patients. Analysis of serum levels of 11 individual patients indicated that a two-compartment model with a residual phase best fits the data. The mean alpha, beta, and terminal half-lives were 8.63+/-2.92, 105.90+/-37.59 and 168.11+/-53.40 h (+/-1 SD), respectively. The observed mean volume of distribution was 5.94+/-2.55 l, and the mean clearance was 0.0394+/-0.0132 l/h. These values were independent of the dose administered.                                                                                     The photosensitizer, NPe6, was well tolerated with minimal phototoxic side effects, and demonstrated preliminary efficacy against cutaneous malignancies."
7209427	"The cause of hemophilia is deficiency of coagulation factor VIII production in the liver, which can be cured by liver transplantation. Because the hepatic function of hemophilia patients is quite normal except for production of factor VIII, auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplantation (APOLT) is beneficial in that patient survival is secured by preserving native liver even in the event of graft loss. However, it is not known whether the graft of APOLT would be enough to cure hemophilia. We evaluated the efficacy and feasibility of APOLT for hemophilia in a canine hemophilia A model that we established. Partial left liver graft was taken from the normal donor (blood factor VIII activity >    60%). The graft was transplanted to the hemophilia beagle dog (blood factor VIII activity <    5%) after resection of the left lobe preserving native right lobe. Changes in time of blood factor VIII activity and liver function parameters were observed after APOLT. APOLT and perioperative hemostatic management were successfully performed. The blood factor VIII activity increased to 30% after APOLT, and was sustained at least 6 weeks throughout the observation period without symptoms of bleeding. The result demonstrated sustained production of factor VIII in the hemophilia recipient after APOLT. Transplantation of approximately one third of whole liver resulted in cure of hemophilia. In conclusion, it is suggested that APOLT would be feasible as a curative treatment of hemophilia A to improve quality of life of the patients."
8457760	"Hair follicle (HF) morphogenesis relies on the coordinated exchange of signals between mesenchymal and epithelial compartments of embryonic skin. Chemokine receptor Cxcr4 expression was recently identified in dermal condensates (DCs) of nascent HFs, but its role in promoting HF morphogenesis remains unknown. Our analyses confirmed Cxcr4 expression in condensate cells, and additionally revealed transient Cxcr4 expression in incipient epithelial hair placodes. Placodal Cxcr4 appeared prior to detection in DCs, representing a switch of expression between epithelial and mesenchymal compartments. To explore the functional role of this receptor in both compartments for early HF formation, we conditionally ablated Cxcr4 with condensate-targeting Tbx18(cre) knock-in and epidermis-targeting Krt14-cre transgenic mice. Conditional knockouts for both crosses were viable throughout embryogenesis and into adulthood. Morphological and biochemical marker analyses revealed comparable numbers of HFs forming in knockout embryos compared to wild-type littermate controls in both cases, suggesting that neither dermal nor epithelial Cxcr4 expression is required for early HF morphogenesis. We conclude that Cxcr4 expression and chemokine signaling through this receptor in embryonic mouse skin is dispensable for HF formation."
7148725	"Congenital absence of portal vein and extrahepatic portocaval shunt, also referred to as an Abernethy type 1, is a rare malformation of the mesenteric vasculature. A 9-year-old girl presented with dyspnea on exertion and orthodeoxia. A diagnosis of an Abernethy malformation type 1b and hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) was made, and she underwent auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplantation (APOLT). Symptoms and signs of HPS resolved 2 months after the operation. HPS in Abernethy syndrome is a manifestation of normal portal blood flow bypassing the liver and can be ameliorated by redirecting blood flow to a segment of liver with normal portal anatomy. APOLT is a feasible and successful surgical procedure for patients with Abernethy malformation and HPS."
8666140	"Current clinical approaches to melanoma diagnosis have not been associated with a decrease in mortality from this cancer. The components of the new approach presented are, first, a screening examination to look for any lesion that stands out because of being dark, different, or changing; second, when a single lesion is recognized to be of concern for any reason, that lesion is then evaluated in more detail utilizing the ABCDE criteria, with the ""D"" signifying ""Dark"" and not ""6 mm Diameter"" in this mnemonic; and, third, additional discussion of the ""ugly duckling"" sign and of the recognition of nodular melanomas. Since the Georgia Society of Dermatology and Dermatologic Surgery was the first state or national society to endorse this approach, I refer to it as the Georgia approach."

A clinical comparative study was undertaken on 96 Patients of onychomycosis during the period between August 2005 to July 2006. Forty-eight patients were randomly assigned in group A to receive oral terbinafine 250 mg, one tablet twice daily for seven days every month (pulse therapy); 24 patients in group B to receive oral terbinafine pulse therapy plus topical ciclopirox olamine 8% to be applied once daily at night on all affected nails; and 24 patients in group C to receive oral terbinafine pulse therapy plus topical amorolfine hydrochloride 5% to be applied once weekly at night on all the affected nails. The treatment was continued for four months. The patients were evaluated at four weekly intervals till sixteen weeks and then at 24 and 36 weeks.                                                                              We observed clinical cure in 71.73, 82.60 and 73.91% patients in groups A, B and C, respectively; Mycological cure rates against dematophytes were 88.9, 88.9 and 85.7 in groups A, B and C, respectively. The yeast mycological cure rates were 66.7, 100 and 50 in groups A, B and C, respectively. In the case of nondermatophytes, the overall response was poor: one out of two cases (50%) responded in group A, while one case each in group B and group C did not respond at all.

3774433	"There have been few studies of the immune status of long-term follow-up patients after living-donor kidney transplantation. We investigated the immune status from the immunologic and pathologic standpoint of three long surviving recipients who had received renal grafts more than 30 years earlier. Anti-HLA antibodies that had not been present before transplantation were detected in one recipient with three HLA mismatches. One recipient with identical HLA showed positive for the crossmatch test, but not for the panel reactive antibody test (PRA), thus showing that this patient had HLA antibodies against HLA minor histocompatibility antigens, etc. Only one patient with established microchimerism was stable without any antibody production. Pathologically, chronic allograft nephropathy with C4d staining suggestive of antibody-mediated rejection was observed in both patients with HLA antibodies. Physicians should clinically manage patients by always bearing in mind the presence of anti-donor antibodies during long-term regular follow-up of transplanted kidneys."
8206358	"To present the case histories and management by LASER tympanic neurectomy of two patients who presented with pain as their only symptom after cochlear implantation, avoiding the need for device removal.                                                                                            Two of our patients presented with otalgia, which appeared 6 months after cochlear implantation and resulted in their refusing to use the device. The pain was not controlled by repeated remapping or medical management. Neither patient showed evidence of infection or inflammation around their device. X-rays showed that there were no extracochlear electrodes or evidence of extrusion. One patient had current leakage from two electrodes, which were switched off, but the pain persisted.                                                                                   Both patients received an intratympanic injection of 1 ml of 0.5% Bupivacaine to anaesthetize the tympanic plexus in the middle ear and were then observed for a day, found to have relief of their pain and were able to use the implant with audiological benefit for this short time, until the effect of the anaesthetic had worn off. Therefore we planned and performed a tympanic neurectomy on both patients using CO2 laser.

6825688	"The binding of two alpha-galactophilic lectins, Marasmius oreades agglutinin (MOA), and Griffonia simplicifolia I isolectin B(4) (GS I-B(4)) to neoglycoproteins and natural glycoproteins were compared in a surface phase assay. Neoglycoproteins carrying various alpha-galactosylated glycans and laminin from basement membrane of mouse sarcoma that contains the xenogenic Galalpha1-3Gal1-4GlcNAc epitope were immobilized in microtiter plate wells and lectin binding determined with an enzyme-linked assay. After 24 h of incubation, MOA had higher affinity for the xenogenic pentasaccharide (Galalpha1-3Gal1-4GlcNAcbeta1-3Galbeta1-4Glc) than for the Galalpha-monosaccharide. The binding properties of MOA and GS I-B(4) to the xenogenic disaccharide (Galalpha1-3Galbeta1) were comparable while the binding of MOA to the xenogenic pentasaccharide was much stronger than the binding of GS I-B(4) to the same epitope. Non-xenogenic disaccharide-coupled neoglycoproteins having galactose end groups linked alpha1-2 or alpha1-4 to Gal or linked alpha1-3 to GalNAc bound very weakly to MOA, whereas GS I-B(4) recognized all of these disaccharides with similarly high affinity. MOA also showed high affinity for laminin. The results indicate that the Marasmius oreades lectin has nearly the same affinities as does GS I-B(4) for the simple xenogenic carbohydrate antigens, but MOA has greater affinity for the pentasaccharide and is far more specific in its binding preferences than the Griffonia lectin."
8325476	"There is evidence to suggest that melanoma incidence rates continue to rise in Canada and the United States.                                                                                  Our objective was to determine cutaneous melanoma trends from 1993 to 2002 in the province of Alberta and to compare the results to previously published provincial analyses for the decade of 1967-1976.                                                                              A retrospective study of 3479 patients with cutaneous melanoma diagnosed in Alberta between 1993 and 2002 was conducted. Estimates of relative survival compared the survival of melanoma patients with the Alberta population to derive the likelihood of surviving melanoma in the absence of other causes of death. Further comparison to published Canadian data was also conducted.                                                                              For the period 1993-2002, the annual melanoma age-standardized incidence rates per 100,000 person-years ranged between 11.1 and 15.9 and between 9.8 and 14.1 among men and women, respectively. These rates are considerably higher than the previously reported (1976) highest Alberta incidence rates of 4.1 and 4.8 in men and women, respectively. The rates increased slightly for the period 1993-1999 with an average annual percentage change of +3.5%, but appeared to decrease for the interval 1999-2002 with an average annual percentage change of -6.4%. The majority of the tumors were less than 1.0 mm in thickness for both genders. On univariate analysis the following parameters were associated with decreasing patient survival: male gender, increasing age, head and neck tumors, Clark level of invasion, and Breslow tumor thickness. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the strongest determinant of survival was Breslow tumor thickness.                                                                                      Melanomas in-situ were not included in this study.                                                                                      Although melanoma incidence rates in Alberta are higher than previously reported, the incidence rates over the study period of 1993 to 2002 appear to have leveled and may in fact be declining over the past several years."
3211115	"The evolution of plant development can be studied in many different ways, each of which provides new insights into how plants have been modified over evolutionary time. DNA sequencing shows that most developmental genes are under purifying selection and that obvious adaptive change in proteins is rare. This may indicate that most change occurs in cis-regulatory sequences, that tests for detecting selection lack power, or both. Gene duplications are common and often correlate with divergence of function, as predicted by theory. Studies of gene expression illuminate similarities among structures in disparate plant groups and indicate that the same genes have been deployed repeatedly for similar developmental ends. Comparative functional studies remain uncommon, but promise to illuminate how changing proteins lead to changes in development. Precise characterization of phenotypes by studies of developmental morphology is beginning to occur in some taxonomic groups. The genetic variation necessary for morphological change must originate as allelic polymorphism within populations; such polymorphism has been identified in grasses and in sunflowers, although it is often cryptic."

8645780	"The concept of a biomarker was defined as ""a characteristic marker that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention"" by the National Institutes of Health Biomarkers Definitions Working group in 2001. Clinical features, disease progress, therapeutic response and prognosis are heterogeneous among patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). Therefore, biomarkers that can predict these matters are required for the progress of clinical practice. At present, SSc-specific autoantibodies are the most useful biomarkers for diagnosis and predicting clinical features. Otherwise, biomarkers specific only for SSc have not been identified yet. The glycoprotein krebs von den Lungen-6, surfactant protein-D and CCL18 are promising serum biomarkers of SSc-related interstitial lung diseases. Serum/plasma levels of brain natriuretic peptide and serum N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide have been used as biomarkers for SSc-related pulmonary arterial hypertension. Other potential serum/plasma biomarkers for fibrosis and vascular involvement of SSc are connective tissue growth factor, interleukin-6, CCL2, CXCL4, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, P-selectin, vascular endothelial growth factor, von Willebrand factor, endostatin, endoglin and endothelin-1. In our multicenter prospective studies of Japanese early SSc, serum ICAM-1 levels were predictive for subsequent respiratory dysfunction and serum levels of CXCL8 and P-selectin were predictive for subsequent physical disability. Further large, multicenter, prospective, longitudinal studies will be needed to identify and validate critical biomarkers of SSc."
1255656	"Genetically engineered plants are economical platforms for the large-scale production of recombinant proteins and have been used over the last 21 years as models for oral vaccines against a wide variety of human infectious and autoimmune diseases with promising results. The main inherent advantages of this approach consist in the absence of purification needs and easy production and administration. One relevant infectious agent is the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), since AIDS evolved as an alarming public health problem implicating very high costs for government agencies in most African and developing countries. The design of an effective and inexpensive vaccine able to limit viral spread and neutralizing the viral entry is urgently needed. Due to the limited efficacy of the vaccines assessed in clinical trials, new HIV vaccines able to generate broad immune profiles are a priority in the field. This review discusses the current advances on the topic of using plants as alternative expression systems to produce functional vaccine components against HIV, including antigens from Env, Gag and early proteins such as Tat and Nef. Ongoing projects of our group based on the expression of chimeric proteins comprising C4 and V3 domains from gp120, as an approach to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies are mentioned. The perspectives of the revised approaches, such as the great need of assessing the oral immunogenicity and a detailed immunological characterization of the elicited immune responses, are also discussed."
5003235	"Stem cell factor (SCF) and its receptor, KIT, are essential to the migration and differentiation of melanocytes during embryogenesis. We previously demonstrated that apoptosis is induced by blocking survival function of the SCF/KIT interaction in a mouse neural crest cell (NCC) primary culture. Using the NCCmelb4 cell line, we investigated the occurrence of apoptosis in the cultured cells when KIT receptors were blocked by the monoclonal anti-KIT antibody (ACK2). Apoptosis following treatment with ACK2 was detected by DNA fragmentation assay, in situ apoptosis detection, and electron microscopy. We noted a decrease in extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) and ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) protein expression following ACK2 incubation. Western blot analysis and real-time quantitative RT-PCR revealed an apparent time-dependent reduction in Bcl-2 protein levels with respect to ACK2 within the NCCmelb4 cells. In terms of Bax expression, a difference was not found. Fas and caspase8 proteins increased time-dependently in proportion to ACK2 incubation. We noted apoptotic cell death upon addition of ACK2, with evidence of possible involvement of Bcl-2 and Fas in the induction of apoptosis. In contrast, no significant correlation between Fas ligand (Fas-L) expression and ACK2 was found. Fas activation appears to occur independent of Fas-L during ACK2-induced cell death. Therefore, we propose that Fas-L expression in NCCmelb4 cells does not play a major role in facilitating apoptosis. Furthermore, we hypothesize that these molecules combined with SCF/KIT play an important role in regulating the induction of vertebrate NCC apoptosis during embryogenesis."
9085623	"The development of persistent nodules that cause pain and itching at a vaccination or hyposensitization injection site is a rare event. These lesions have been mainly attributed to a hypersensitivity reaction to aluminum hydroxide, which is used as an absorbing agent in many vaccines and hyposensitization preparations. Patch tests with standard antigens and aluminum compounds and histopathologic and ultrastructural studies were performed on 10 patients with persistent subcutaneous nodules on the upper part of their arms after injection of aluminum-adsorbed dust and/or pollen extracts.                                                                                   The nodules appeared 1 month to 6.5 years after injections. The results of patch tests with 2% aluminum chloride were positive in five patients. Histopathologic examination revealed two different patterns: some biopsy specimens (from lesions of less than 9 months' duration) showed a pure foreign body histiocytic reaction characterized by extracellular amorphous dermal basophilic deposits with a histiocytic-macrophagic reaction; others showed a delayed hypersensitivity granulomatous reaction in association with an histiocytic foreign body response. The lesions were characterized by a unifocal or multifocal unencapsulated granulomatous reaction in the deep dermis and/or subcutaneous tissue. Eosinophilic necrotic areas surrounded by dense fibrous bands and a massive inflammatory infiltrate (lymphoid follicles, large histiocytic cells, abundant eosinophils, and some plasma cells) were observed. A granular basophilic material in extracellular spaces and within the cytoplasm of some histiocytes was also noted. Electron microscopic studies revealed intracytoplasmic and extracellular deposits of a fibrillar electron-dense material.                                                                                      Persistent subcutaneous nodules that develop after the administration of aluminum-containing preparations may show two characteristic histopathologic patterns. A pure histiocytic foreign body reaction was observed in early lesions, and a delayed hypersensitivity granulomatous reaction was seen in older lesions. No relationship between histopathologic pattern and patch test results was observed. Aluminum-free preparations should be used in patients in whom these nodules develop."
8728772	"A 6-year-old boy developed a unilateral itchy rash, which was followed by a less severe bilateral involvement. The lesions resolved spontaneously within 4 weeks. Apparently, the rash was triggered by an adenovirus infection of the respiratory tract. Terms used currently for this disorder include 'unilateral laterothoracic exanthem' or 'asymmetrical periflexural exanthem of childhood'. The recently proposed term 'superimposed lateralized exanthem of childhood' implies the new concept that an early postzygotic mutation has rendered the skin on one side of the body more reactive to infective agents. The subsequent bilateral involvement would reflect a less severe reactivity of the contralateral keratinocytes."
5888244	"Ursolic acid (UA) and oleanolic acid (ONA) are pentacyclic triterpenoids, which naturally occur in many medicinal herbs and plants. Recent research revealed that several pharmacological effects could be attributed to UA and ONA, such as anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial activities. To evaluate the effects of UA and ONA on epidermal permeability barrier recovery and normal skin, both flanks of hairless mice were topically treated with either 0.01-0.1 mg/mL UA or 0.1-1.0 mg/mL ONA after tape stripping and transepidermal water loss (TEWL) were assessed, and then hydration and TEWL were measured for 3 weeks with application of UA and ONA (2 mg/mL). We also investigated the morphological changes using light (LM) and electron microscopic (EM) examination. Finally, we observed that UA and ONA stimulated epidermal keratinocyte differentiation via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha using Western immunoblotting. The recovery rate of epidermal permeability barrier after tape stripping increased in the UA- and ONA-treated groups (0.1 mg/mL UA and 0.5 mg/mL ONA) at 6 h to more than 20% when compared to the vehicle-treated group (P <    0.05). In both groups, hydration was increased compared to the vehicle group from 1 week without TEWL alteration (P <    0.05). An LM finding showed that epidermal thickening was frequently observed (UA >    ONA >    vehicle). EM examination revealed an increase in secretion and in the number of lamellar bodies in treated groups and that complete formation of lipid bilayers was also prominent (ONA >    UA >    vehicle). Protein expression of PPAR-alpha, involucrin, loricrin and filaggrin increased twofold and threefold in HaCaT cells treated for 24 h with either ONA (10 micromol/L) or UA (10 micromol/L), respectively, reflecting that the UA and ONA can improve the recovery of skin barrier function and induce epidermal keratinocyte differentiation via PPAR-alpha. Taken together, these results suggest that UA and ONA will be pertinent candidates for the improvement of epidermal permeability barrier function."
5692337	"An optimal haemoglobin (Hb) response to erythropoietin requires elevated iron indices in dialysis patients; however, it is unknown if the same applies in chronic kidney disease (CKD).                                                                              One hundred patients [CKD Stages 3-5, Hb >   or= 110 g/L, iron replete, erythropoietin-stimulating agent (ESA)-naive, 47% diabetic, median age 69.5 years] were block-randomized in an open-label study to receive up to 200 mg intravenous iron sucrose (Group A, n = 52) bimonthly or oral iron sulphate (Group B) to maintain raised and normal iron indices (respectively) over 12 months. The primary endpoint was the change in Hb concentration at 12 months or at termination after at least 6 months of treatment.                                                                              Eighty-five patients reached the primary endpoint (43, Group A; 42, Group B). Initial Hb was 119 +/- 7 vs 116 +/- 12 g/L (mean +/- standard deviation); ferritin 122 (71-176), median (inter-quartile range), vs 90 microg/L (58-150); transferrin saturation (TSat) 22 (18-26) vs 21% (15-24); and creatinine 240 (195-313) vs 230 micromol/L (184-352). Ferritin and TSat differed by month 2 [157 (103-220) vs 96 microg/L (73-162), P = 0.003] and month 6 [25 (20-31) vs 21% (17-27), P = 0.02], respectively. At study end, Hb did not differ between groups (121 +/- 10 vs 117 +/- 13 g/L). Ferritin was 362 (310-458) vs 125 microg/L (84-190), P <    0.001; TSat 30 (23-34) vs 21% (18-24), P <    0.001; and creatinine 229 (188-326) vs 272 micromol/L (195-413), P = NS. For patients (Groups A and B, n = 27 in each group) whose creatinine regression slope increased (indicating worsening function), the fall in Hb over 12 months also did not differ between groups despite adequate separation in iron indices. Serious adverse events overall did not differ between groups.

4888758	"Cardiac cell replacement therapy is a promising therapy to improve cardiac function in heart failure. Persistence, structural and functional maturation and integration of transplanted cardiomyocytes into recipient's hearts are crucial for a safe and efficient replacement of lost cells. We studied histology, electrophysiology and quantity of intramyocardially transplanted rat neonatal cardiomyocytes (NCM) and performed a detailed functional study with repeated invasive (pressure-volume-catheter) and non-invasive (echocardiography) analyses of infarcted female rat hearts including pharmacological stress before and 3 weeks after intramyocardial injection of 5x10     6       (low-NCM) or 25x10     6       (high-NCM) syngeneic male NCM or medium as placebo (Ctrl). Quantitative real-time PCR for Ychromosome confirmed a 5-fold higher persisting male cell number in high-NCM vs. low-NCM after 3 weeks. Sharp electrode measurements within viable slices of recipient hearts demonstrated that transplanted NCM integrate into host myocardium and mature to an almost adult phenotype, which might be facilitated through gap junctions between host myocardium and transplanted NCM as indicated by connexin43 in histology. Ejection fraction of recipient hearts was severely impaired after LAD-ligation (pressure-volume-catheter: 39.2±3.6%, echocardiography: 39.9±1.4%), repeated analyses revealed a significant further decline within 3 weeks in Ctrl but a dose-dependent stabilization in cell-treated groups. Consistently, stabilized cardiac function/morphology in cell-treated groups was seen in stroke volume, cardiac output, ventricle length and wall thickness. Our findings reassure that cardiac cell replacement is a promising therapy for ischaemic heart disease since immature cardiomyocytes persist, integrate and mature after intramyocardial transplantation and they dose-dependently stabilize cardiac function after myocardial infarction."
2064324	"It has been shown recently that a flavonoid fraction (fraction II) obtained from a crude extract of Hypericum perforatum (St. John's Wort) was remarkably active in the forced swimming test (FST). Fraction II was further separated using MLCCC to give fractions IIa and IIb. Both fractions proved to be active in the FST at different dosages. Further separation of fraction IIa by preparative HPLC yielded fraction IIa1 which mainly was composed of hyperoside, isoquercitrin, miquelianin and quercitrin, and fraction IIa2 which contained small amounts of hyperoside and astilbin, while most compounds were not known. Both fractions were active after acute treatment in the FST. Isolates obtained from these fractions including hyperoside, isoquercitrin, quercitrin, miquelianin, the aglycone quercetin and astilbin, were tested for activity in the FST. Except for quercetin, quercitrin and astilbin all compounds were active. To exclude false positive results in the FST the validity was checked in open field experiments and in the FST after 12 days of daily treatment."
8901735	"Neutrophil-activating protein-1/interleukin 8 (NAP-1/IL-8), purified to homogeneity from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human peripheral blood monocytes, was injected intracutaneously into human skin. Sequential biopsy specimens were taken in order to investigate the sequence of ultrastructural changes induced by the cytokine. Whereas intracutaneous injection of 100 ng of NAP-1/IL-8 per site caused no macroscopic changes, by histology infiltration with polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and monocytes was present within 1 h and increased at 3 and 5 h. No lymphocyte infiltration was noted. The first ultrastructural changes (30 min) consisted of the presence of cytoplasmic 7-nm microfilament bundles, as well as numerous protrusions of the luminal plasma membrane of endothelial cells (EC). As a striking feature, multiple 100- to 160-nm electron lucent vesicles could be observed in the EC cytoplasm. These structures differed from plasmalemmal vesicles and suggest secretory activity. When PMN and monocytes appeared in the vascular lumen (1 h and later), the number of 100-160-nm electron-lucent vesicles had decreased significantly. In contrast to C5a-injected skin sites, mast cell degranulation was absent."
9464681	"This study was aimed at assessing university students' awareness and opinions about aspects of the law no. 10.221/01. This exploratory study was performed among students at the São Paulo Federal University-UNIFESP, from 2001 to July 2002, including 1284 undergraduates in the following courses: nursing, medicine, speech and language therapy, biomedicine, and ophthalmic technology. That data show that 47.7% (333) of undergraduates are aware of the kind of donation established by the new law. Among the adolescents of first and second grades, and courses, there was a difference on the awareness about the kind of donation (P =.000). Most undergraduates (57.6%, 402) agree with consented donation. However, the high percentage--35.1% (245)--that chose the alternative ""I don't know"" is remarkable. Results show that many undergraduates are unaware of the specifications of the technical files for transplants; only 48.3% (337) of them chose the correct answer, and 79.4% (554) do not believe that the order in the waiting list for transplants is respected. The conclusion is that it is worth emphasizing is that there are different opinions and levels of awareness among students, considering age, religion and religious practice, and course and level at school. In spite of unawareness and lack of belief in the principles of distribution of organs and tissue, most students are willing to be donors (68.2%)."

9351445	"1. In 1966, the half-life (1-year posttransplantation) for first cadaver-donor kidney grafts reported to the UCLA Registry was around 7.5 years (1). Between 1985 and 1990, this half-life was 7.8 +/- 0.02 years. Since 1966, the corresponding 1-year graft survival rates increased by over 30 percentage points. Clearly, improvement in early graft survival has had little bearing on long-term graft outcome. 2. From a stratified multivariate analysis of 40,582 primary cadaveric renal transplants recorded in the UCLA Transplant Registry from 3 consecutive eras (1975-79, 1980-84, 1985-90), the following long-term graft survival trends in covariates have emerged: a) a constant strong negative effect associated with higher numbers of HLA-A,B mismatches, younger and older recipients, diabetics, and longer cold ischemia times in each era; b) an increased beneficial effect on female recipients; c) an increased detrimental effect on Black recipients, despite short-term gains; and d) a positive effect of CsA usage (only in the most recent era). 3. From a multivariate analysis of 15,027 primary cadaveric renal transplants reported to the UNOS Kidney Registry between 1987 and 1990, we analyzed the effects of transplantation factors on survival during 3 consecutive posttransplantation risk periods: 0-1 month; 1-3 months; and beyond 3 months. Few pretransplant factors affected risk of failure within 1-month posttransplantation. However, a good predischarge clinical course (as indicated by CsA usage, no required dialysis during the first postoperative week, and no rejection episodes) was associated with an immediate improvement in graft survival. The effects of most UNOS transplantation factors during the second risk period were comparable to the short-term coefficients estimated from the UCLA file; and the effects of the UNOS factors on ""beyond 3-month"" risk were comparable to the UCLA long-term coefficients. Conclusively, the dominant pretransplant factor on long-term risk was HLA-A,B tissue matching."
8732433	"Recent papers have reported that there are at least two distinct binding sites of bullous pemphigoid (BP) antibodies; one is the extracellular (lamina lucida) BP antigen (E-BPA) and the other is the intracellular (basal cell cytomembrane-hemidesmosome-cytoskeleton) BP antigen (I-BPA). In attempting to characterize the properties of these two BP antigens (BPA), we have investigated the expression of E-BPA and I-BPA as well as other basement membrane zone (BMZ) components such as type IV collagen, laminin, and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA) antigen at the dermal-epibolic junction as a model system for BMZ neogenesis. I-BPA was found along the dermal-epidermal junction and throughout the whole length of the dermal-epibolic junction. However, E-BPA and other BMZ components were found along the dermal-epidermal junction and along only the most proximal portion of the dermal-epibolic junction. These results suggest 1) that emergence of E-BPA varies from that of I-BPA in such a model system of BMZ neogenesis, and 2) that the emerged E-BPA may attach to the newly formed basement membrane complex."
1730033	"Guard cells in intact leafs display light-induced membrane potential changes, which alter the direction of K+-transport across the plasma membrane (Roelfsema et al., 2001). A beam of blue light, but not red light, directed at the impaled guard cell triggers this response, while both light qualities induce opening of stomata. To gain insight into this apparent contradiction, we explored the possible interaction between red light and CO2. Guard cells in the intact plant were impaled with double-barrelled electrodes and illuminated with red light. Cells that were hyperpolarized in CO2-free air, depolarized after a switch to air with 700 micro l l(-1) CO2, in a reversible manner. As a result, K+-fluxes across the plasma membrane changed direction, to favour K+ extrusion and stomatal closure in the presence of CO2. Concurrent with the depolarization, an inward current across the plasma membrane appeared, most likely due to activation of anion channels. Guard cell responses to CO2 could be recorded in darkness as well as in red light. However, in darkness some cells spontaneously depolarized, these cells hyperpolarized again in red light. Here, red light was projected on a large area of the leaf and decreased the intracellular CO2 concentration by about 250 micro l l(-1), as measured with a miniature CO2 sensor placed in the substomatal cavity. We conclude, that in intact leaves the red light response of guard cells is mediated through a decrease of the intercellular CO2 concentration."

The consequences of 12/15-LOX deficiency in MSC densities in skin are unknown.                                                                                   To determine the effect of 12/15-LOX deficiency in MSC densities in wounded and unwounded dermis.                                                                              Full-thickness skin incisional wounds were made to 12/15-LOX-deficient (12/15-LOX(-/-) ) and wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice. Wounded skin was collected at 3, 8, or 14 days postwounding (dpw). MSCs were analysed in skin sections using histology. 12S- or 15S-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) was analysed using a reversed-phase Chiral liquid chromatography-ultraviolet-tandem mass spectrometer.                                                                              There were more stem cell antigen (Sca)1(+) CD29(+) MSCs (cells/field) at 3, 8, and 14 dpw, more Sca1(+) CD106(+) MSCs at 3 and 14 dpw in the wounded dermis, more MSCs in unwounded dermis of WT mice compared with 12/15-LOX(-/-) mice, and more MSCs in the wounded dermis than in the unwounded dermis. For 12/15-LOX(-/-) dermis, Sca1(+) CD106(+) MSCs peaked and Sca1(+) CD29(+) MSCs reached a flat level at 8 dpw. However, for the WT dermis, MSCs increased from 8 to 14 dpw. There were more Sca1(+) CD106(+) MSCs than Sca1(+) CD29(+) MSCs in the 12/15-LOX(-/-) wounded dermis at 8 dpw. However, there were more Sca1(+) CD29(+) MSCs in the 12/15-LOX(-/-) than Sca1(+) CD106(+) MSCs in the WT wounded dermis at 3 dpw, and Sca1(+) CD106(+) MSCs and Sca1(+) CD29(+) MSCs were at comparable levels in other conditions. 12/15-LOX deficiency suppressed levels of 12/15-LOX protein and their products, 12S-HETE and 15S-HETE, in wounds.                                                                                      12/15-LOX deficiency reduces MSC densities in the dermis, which correlates with the suppressed 12/15-LOX pathways in wounded and unwounded skin."

The total number of lesions repaired by excision, as well as the removal of pyrimidine dimers and E. coli endonuclease III--sensitive sites did not differ significantly in the three SLE cell strains compared with normal cells. However, abnormalities in the formation and maintenance of DNA-protein crosslinks (DPC) and DNA single-strand breaks (SSB) were found in SLE-4 and SLE-5 following simulated sunlight exposure. In contrast, SLE-3 cells exhibited responses similar to normal cells in reference to SSB and DPC formation. These findings correlate well with the previously determined UV sensitivity of these SLE cell strains."
5916407	"In the 2009 IXA consensus, the requirements for the quality and control of manufacturing of porcine islet products were based on the U.S. regulatory framework where the porcine islet products fall within the definition of somatic cell therapy under the statutory authority of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In addition, porcine islet products require pre-market approval as a biologic product under the Public Health Services Act and they meet the definition of a drug under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&    C Act). Thus, they are subject to applicable provisions of the law and as such, control of manufacturing as well as reproducibility and consistency of porcine islet products, safety of porcine islet products, and characterization of porcine islet products must be met before proceeding to clinical trials. In terms of control of manufacturing as well as reproducibility and consistency of porcine islet products, the manufacturing facility must be in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) guidelines appropriate for the initiation of Phase 1/2 clinical trials. Sponsors intending to conduct a Phase 1/2 trial of islet xenotransplantation products must be able to demonstrate the safety of the product through the establishment of particular quality assurance and quality control procedures. All materials (including animal source and pancreas) used in the manufacturing process of the porcine islet products must be free of adventitious agents. The final porcine islet product must undergo tests for the presence of these adventitious agents including sterility, mycoplasma (if they are cultured), and endotoxin. Assessments of the final product must include the safety specifications mentioned above even if the results are not available until after release as these data would be useful for patient diagnosis and treatment if necessary. In addition, a plan of action must be in place for patient notification and treatment in case the sterility culture results are positive. In terms of the characterization of porcine islet products and product release criteria, the information on the porcine islet products should be acquired from a sample of the final product to be used for transplantation and must include the morphology of the islets, specific identity, purity, viability, and potency of the product. In addition, information on the quantity of the islet products should also be provided in a standardized fashion and this should be in terms of islet equivalents and/or cell numbers. The current consensus was created to provide guidelines that manufacturing facilities may find helpful in the manufacture of and the release criteria for porcine islet products including encapsulated islets and combined islet products. Our intent with the above recommendations is to provide a framework for individual porcine islet manufacturing facilities to ensure a high level of safety for the initiation of Phase 1/2 clinical trials on porcine islet xenotransplantation."
2335027	"Most living organ donations are from genetically or emotionally related donors. Although some transplant centers are willing to accept donations from living anonymous kidney donors (LAKDs), very few centers will accept donations from living anonymous liver donors (LALDs). The difference in acceptance rates is primarily due to the greater risk in liver donation, which is estimated to be 10-fold that of the risk in kidney donation. We present a case of donation from a LALD, the first reported in Canada. There are currently no established standards for LALDs. Our criteria for the ethical acceptability of LALDs require such donors to be physically healthy, mentally competent, altruistic, highly motivated, well-informed and able to give voluntary consent to donation. Another major ethical criterion is that the likely psychological benefit to the LALD balances the physical risks. Our case demonstrates that transplants from LALDs are medically successful and ethically justified under certain conditions."
6094749	Angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy (AIL) is an uncommon immunoproliferative disorder with a presentation similar to malignant lymphoma but with a benign histopathologic picture. We report a case of a 49-year-old woman with AIL who manifested a pruritic maculopapular eruption as her presenting complaint and whose disease pursued an aggressive clinical course. Forty-four percent of patients with AIL experience a nonspecific dermatitis that in general is maculopapular and precedes other clinical symptoms by at least several weeks. AIL should be included in the differential diagnosis of any maculopapular eruption of unknown etiology accompanied by lymphadenopathy.
1699213	"RNA interference (RNAi) is a sequence-specific, posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) process in plants that is mediated by dsRNA homologous to the silenced gene(s). In this study, we report an efficient method to produce dsRNA using a bacterial expression system. Two fragments of the Sugarcane Mosaic Virus (SCMV) CP (coat protein) gene were amplified by RT-PCR, and cloned into the inverted-repeat cloning vector pUCCRNAi. The two recombinant plasmids were transformed individually into E. coli HT115, an RNase-III deficient strain, and dsRNA was induced by isopropyl-β-D: -thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The crude extracts of E. coli HT115 containing large amounts of dsRNA were applied to plants as a spray and the experiment confirmed a preventative efficacy. Our findings demonstrated that spraying crude dsRNA-containing extracts inhibited SCMV infection, and the dsRNA derived from an upstream region (CP1) was more effective than was dsRNA derived from a downstream region (CP2) of the SCMV CP gene. The results provide a valuable tool for plant viral control using dsRNA and the PTGS approach."
6236352	"Some relationships are established between diabetes mellitus (DM) and a series of cutaneous disorders. Specific dermatoses are markers for undiagnosed DM. Other disorders represent supervening complications in an already treated DM patient.                                                                                  To review the information about dermocosmetic care products and their appropriate use in the management and prevention of dermatoses related to DM.                                                                             The peer-reviewed literature and empiric findings are covered. Owing to the limited clinical evidence available for the use of dermocosmetics, a review of the routine practices and common therapies in DM-related dermatoses was conducted.                                                                              Some DM-related dermatoses (acanthosis nigricans, pigmented purpuric dermatosis) are markers of macrovascular complications. The same disorders and some others (xerosis, Dupuytren's disease) have been found to be more frequently associated with microangiopathy. Other skin diseases (alopecia areata, vitiligo) were found to be markers of autoimmunity, particularly in type 1 DM. Unsurprisingly, using dermocosmetics and appropriate skin care has shown objective improvements of some DM-related dermatoses, such effects improve the quality of life. The most common skin manifestations of DM fall along continuum between ""dry skin,"" xerosis, and acquired ichthyosis, occurring predominately on the shins and feet. Dermocosmetic products improve the feeling of well-being for DM patients."
3546142	"We report clinical findings in a 12-year-old girl with long-term recurrent and disseminated multiple eruptions of tinea faciei and tinea corporis, which persisted for 10 years. Mycological examination revealed the dermatophyte Trichophyton tonsurans in both scale samples from the body lesions and in brushing samples from her asymptomatic scalp, suggesting that she was an asymptomatic dermatophyte carrier on the scalp, and autoinoculation of the dermatophyte was responsible for the recurrent and disseminated tinea faciei/corporis."
6351460	"Transplantation of allogeneic pancreatic islets for the treatment of patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is now a reality. The steady progress that has allowed for the recent successful clinical trials world-wide follows a steep learning curve and the perseverance of the international islet transplantation community. The Clinical Islet Transplant Program at the Diabetes Research Institute - University of Miami has contributed to the progress in the field with a 20-year track record. It has been a long journey and despite the intermediate success, more work is needed in order to achieve the ultimate goal of a safe and long-lasting treatment for patients with T1DM."

It is characterized by nodular prurigo-like lichenified lesions, nail dystrophy, and variable presence of albopapuloid lesions. We report two such cases."
8800114	"Epigenetic regulation of gene expression by DNA methylation is a central mechanism governing the silencing of tumor suppressor genes in many forms of cancer. Current methods have not proven optimal for the quantitative analysis of DNA methylation and corresponding in situ protein expression within cells in small specimens like skin biopsies. We have overcome this limitation by combining and modifying several techniques: target cell enrichment, DNA micro-isolation, one-step denaturation/bisulphite conversion/in-column desulphonation, specially designed PCR amplification, pyrosequencing and multispectral image analysis. Using this approach optimized for small samples, we can quantify minor alterations in gene methylation and protein expression using minimal amounts of tissue. Comparative studies of fresh and processed cells showed that our method is valid for DNA in both fresh and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens. We can measure the effects of DNA methylation inhibitors, administered in vitro or in vivo, on the promoter methylation and protein expression of selected genes in specific cells. This novel approach should prove useful for a wide variety of investigative and clinical applications in dermatology and other specialties where the collection of small, routinely processed biopsy specimens is common. We refer to this method as Q-GAME (quantitative gene analysis of methylation and expression)."
7812834	"Desmosomes are the most prominent and mechanically important epidermal intercellular junctions. Transmembrane proteins of desmosomes, desmogleins and desmocollins, are responsible for extracellular binding and, thus, are important for interkeratinocyte cohesion. We show here, using three different approaches, that the extracellular ""cores"" of epidermal desmosomes contain a highly glycosylated antigen, different from desmosomal cadherins. This protein, recognised by KM48 monoclonal antibody, is likely to be involved in the processes of keratinocyte differentiation, desmosome turnover and epidermal cohesion."
1880274	"Stomata are microscopic pores on the plant epidermis that act as a major passage for the gas and water vapor exchange between a plant and the atmosphere. A pair of specialized guard cells work in concert to adjust pore size to maintain gas exchange while minimizing the water loss. The formation of stomata requires a series of cell-fate transitions from an initial meristemoid mother cell (MMC), to a stem-cell-like precursor meristemoid, to a guard mother cell (GMC), and finally to terminally-differentiated guard cells. Three closely-related Arabidopsis basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) genes SPEECHLESS (SPCH), MUTE, and FAMA act sequentially at each key step to direct cell-fate transitions during stomatal development. In this addendum, we propose that a three-step relay of the three bHLHs establishes the molecular framework for stomatal differentiation. Specific expression patterns as well as protein domain structure and dimerization partners of each stomatal bHLH protein may determine the specific function as a key switch in each regulatory node."
1486579	"Recommendations related to ocular, mucosal and cutaneous involvement of Behçet's disease (BD) are mainly evidence-based, but in cases of vascular, neurological and gastrointestinal involvement there are no guidelines to define the best treatment strategy. We report three adult patients with BD, who received an interleukin-1β inhibitor by subcutaneous injections, canakinumab (at the dosage of 150 mg every 6 weeks), after failure shown by corticosteroids and different combinations of immunosuppressant agents. The prompt and sustained clinical efficacy demonstrated by canakinumab as a monotherapy supports the opportunity of using this specific anti-interleukin-1β agent as a valid therapeutic option for resistant or refractory BD. Open trials and observational studies should be performed to test canakinumab efficacy on a larger number of patients. The most appropriate dosage and intervals between administrations should be decided according to the individual patient, severity or recurrence of clinical manifestations and major organ involvement."
5275243	"Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), a widely used immunosuppressant in solid organ transplantation, is a prodrug to deliver mycophenolic acid (MPA). MMF has been shown to decrease rejection rates and to improve graft survival, and probably accomplishes this through a variety of mechanisms. Its most prominent mechanism is to inhibit lymphocyte proliferation by inhibition of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase. However, just as important to its overall beneficial effects are other mechanisms that include inhibition of proliferation of smooth muscle and fibroblasts, inhibition of antibody production, inhibition of lymphocyte adhesion and migration, and inhibition of nitric oxide synthase."
2848063	"New-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT) is an important complication following kidney transplantation. Data from the 5-year early steroid withdrawal double-blind randomized trial were analyzed to determine if steroid avoidance reduced the NODAT risk. Incidence, timing and risk factors for NODAT were evaluated using eight definitions. By American Diabetes Association definition, 36.3% of patients on chronic corticosteroids (CCS) and 35.9% on early corticosteroid withdrawal (CSWD) were diagnosed with NODAT by 5 years. The definition combining fasting blood glucose ≥126 mg/dL on two occasions or treatment identified slightly more cases of NODAT: CCS (39.3%) and CSWD (39.4%). Through 5 years posttransplant, the proportion of NODAT patients requiring treatment were similar (CSWD 22.5% vs. CCS 21.5%); however, insulin therapy was lower with CSWD (3.7% vs. 11.6%; p = 0.049). By multivariate analysis, only age, but not corticosteroid use, was a significant risk factor for NODAT for more than one definition. Numerical, but not statistically significant trends toward lower NODAT rates with CSWD were observed through 5 years for insulin use, HbA1c ≥6.0% and ≥6.5% on two occasions. This prospective, randomized trial of CSWD indicates that CSWD has a limited impact in reducing NODAT when compared to low-dose prednisone (5 mg/day from month 6 to 5 years)."
1095078	"Biosynthetic activity of carrot phytoalexin 6-methoxymellen was induced in cell suspension culture by the treatment with oligogalacturonide elicitor; however, the elicitor-induced activity appreciably reduced in the presence of suramin, a potent inhibitor of GTP-binding proteins. In contrast, addition of G-protein activators, such as mastoparan or GTP-gamma-S, to carrot cell culture triggered 6-methoxymellein production even in the absence of uronide elicitor. An appreciable GTPase activity was found in purified plasma membrane of cultured carrot cells, and the hydrolytic activity was significantly increased by the addition of elicitor. Carrot plasma membrane was capable of associating with GTP-gamma-S, and the binding ability was markedly increased in the presence of elicitor. However, the binding activity markedly decreased when the membrane preparation was pre-incubated with GTP but not with ATP. These observations strongly suggest that a certain GTP-binding protein located at plasma membrane of cultured carrot cells plays an important role in the oligogalacturonide elicitor-induced 6-methoxymellein production."
5288508	"Nodulation (root nodule formation) in legume roots is initiated by the induction of cell divisions and formation of root nodule primordia in the plant root cortex, usually in front of the protoxylem ridges of the central root cylinder. We isolated a factor from the central cylinder (stele) of pea roots which enhances hormone-induced cell proliferation in root cortex explants at positions similar to those of nodule primordia. The factor was identified as uridine. Uridine may act as a morphogen in plant roots at picomolar concentrations."
4778059	"Repeated exposure to mid-range ultraviolet light (UVB) can dramatically relieve the pruritus associated with uremia. The efficacy of UVB phototherapy in uremic pruritus has been established in a controlled trial; experience with 38 patients suggests that 80 to 90% of those receiving 6 to 8 exposures respond favorably within the treatment period (2 to 5 weeks). Treatment frequency appears not to influence the remission rate, although patients on more intensive schedules experience relief sooner than those treated once weekly. Remissions are long-lasting in many patients, sometimes longer than 2 years. Patients with recurrent pruritus respond to phototherapy at least as well as previously untreated patients and tend to improve more rapidly. UVB phototherapy appears to exert its beneficial effect systemically rather than locally, but its mechanism of action is otherwise unknown."
4095001	"This paper reports the histopathologic results of 2-year protocol biopsies from patients who were enrolled in the U.S. FK506 kidney transplant study .                                                                              Recipients of cadaveric kidney transplants were randomized to tacrolimus or cyclosporine therapy. Patients active in the trial at 2 years after transplantation were approached for a protocol biopsy. Biopsies were scored by the Banff classification in a blinded fashion by one pathologist.                                                                              A total of 144 patients (41.3% of those active at 2 years) had a 2-year protocol biopsy performed; 79 patients were treated with tacrolimus and 65 patients were treated with cyclosporine. Evidence of acute rejection was found in seven (8.9%) of the 2-year biopsies in tacrolimus-treated patients and six (9.2%) cyclosporine-treated patients. Chronic allograft nephropathy was found in 49 (62.0%) tacrolimus biopsies and 47 (72.3%) cyclosporine biopsies (P=0.155). There were no apparent histopathologic differences between the tacrolimus and cyclosporine biopsies. The occurrence of chronic allograft nephropathy was significantly higher in patients who received a graft from an older donor (P<   0.01), who experienced presumed cyclosporine or tacrolimus nephrotoxicity (P<   0.001), who developed a cytomegalovirus infection (P=0.038), or who experienced acute rejection in the first year after transplantation (P=0.045). A multivariate analysis showed that nephrotoxicity and acute rejection were the most significant predictors for chronic allograft nephropathy.                                                                                      The occurrence of histologic acute rejection was rare at 2 years, confirming the absence of subclinical acute rejection in these late biopsies. A majority of the biopsies showed features consistent with chronic allograft nephropathy that was associated with acute rejection (particularly in cyclosporine-treated patients), nephrotoxicity, and cytomegalovirus infection in the first year. This suggests that nonimmunologic factors, such as drug-induced toxicity, may play an important role in chronic allograft nephropathy."
8758471	"The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor expressed in all skin cell types, which is critically involved in the pathogenesis of a variety of skin diseases and thus represents a potential therapeutic target. Recent studies indicate that blocking AHR activation is desirable in some skin conditions, whereas the opposite, i.e., stimulation of AHR activation, is beneficial in another group of skin disorders. We here propose a model based on qualitative differences in canonical versus non-canonical AHR signaling to reconcile these seemingly contradictory observations."
3488763	"The impairment of organ function due to ischemia-reperfusion injury is still an important problem in solid organ transplantation. Numerous experimental and clinical studies of native organs have shown that ischemia-reperfusion constitutes an acute inflammatory process involving cell surface adhesion molecule expression. These markers are crucial for the recruitment and infiltration of effector cells into the postischemic tissue. Purines released by the postischemic tissue as the products of the degradation of high-energy nucleotides can be regarded as markers of disturbed energy metabolism. The aim of this study was to examine the correlation between circulating adhesion molecules and purine metabolites in graft renal vein plasma during 49 cases of kidney reperfusion. E-selectin, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 concentrations correlated positively with hypoxanthine concentrations during reperfusion, whereas the concentrations of ICAM-1 correlated negatively with xanthine concentrations. The results of the present study suggested that the concentrations of adhesion molecules in the renal vein during reperfusion correlated with purine metabolites, reflecting metabolic changes in renal tissue."
1606073	"The population of the city of Leicester contains, in addition to the 'native' population, a large immigrant 'Asian' community originating from the Indian subcontinent. Among referrals to our department, atopic dermatitis (AD) was 3,3 times more common in Asians. We therefore performed a study based on a cohort of consecutive births in Leicester hospitals to investigate the possible ethnic difference in prevalence and to examine possible reasons for an ethnic difference in referral pattern. Parents of 1,800 children were asked at the time of the birth to allow their child to be entered on a register. A year later, parents of a sample of 499 of these children, 158 Asian and 341 non-Asian, were invited for interview and for examination of the children. A total of 413 children were examined. The overall point prevalence of AD was 10.7% (95% confidence interval, 7.7%-13.7%). There was no significant ethnic difference. However, a history of eczema in a first degree relative was found in 14.2% of Asian subjects and 35.1% of non-Asians (P <    0.0001, chi-square test). The data suggest the increased referrals to our clinic from the Asian community may result from a lower level of familiarity with AD."
8954345	"To determine the role of the oral glucose tolerance test in the early detection of new-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT) and to compare the various risk factors and insulin kinetics in the transplant patients, we studied 41 live-related renal allograft recipients who were not diabetic before transplantation. Immunosuppression included triple drug therapy (cyclosporine, azathioprine and steroids) and rejection episodes were treated with methyl prednisolone (30 mg/kg IV × 3 days). All the study patients were subjected to an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at Day 90 post-transplant and classified as having normal glucose tolerance (NGT), impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and NODAT as per the World Health Organization guidelines. Insulin levels were also determined at 0, ½ hour, 1 hour and 2 hours during OGTT. NODAT was noted in 29.2% of the study patients, IFG in 4.8% of the study patients and NGT in 65.8% of the study patients. All the groups had normal fasting plasma glucose, but higher than normal insulin levels, suggesting insulin resistance. The patients with overt NODAT had, in addition, low fasting insulin (insulin secretory defect). OGTT may be used for the early detection of NODAT. Although insulin resistance is detected in the majority of post-transplant patients, NODAT also reveals also an insulin secretory defect."
1301942	"One significant risk factor for recurrence after Mohs surgery is misinterpretation of slides.                                                                                   To determine how often pathologists detected incompletely excised basal cell carcinoma (BCC) on Mohs slides and to determine risk factors for incompletely excised BCCs.                                                                              This retrospective study included 1653 BCCs treated with Mohs surgery in a university hospital between 2007 and 2011. For routine quality assurance, all slides were additionally reviewed by a pathologist within 1 week of the procedure. For this study, all cases that had divergent interpretations were re-evaluated by a Mohs surgeon and a pathologist. Mixed-effects logistic regression models with Mohs surgeon effects as random effects were used to determine risk factors for incompletely excised BCC.                                                                              Incompletely excised BCCs were detected in 31 cases (2%), in which defects >    20 mm in diameter were an independent risk factor (odds ratio 3.58, 95% confidence interval 1.55-8.28). Other studied variables (i.e. aggressive subtype, previously treated BCC, location on nose and >    2 Mohs stages) did not affect the risk of incompletely excised BCCs.                                                                                      The additional review of Mohs slides might increase accurate interpretation, especially in large BCCs."
9265918	"Demographic changes in our society will lead to an increasing proportion of elderly people. Age-associated multimorbidity often results in polypharmacy and elevates the risk of adverse drug reactions. Decisive alterations in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are detectable in old age, primarily a decrease in total body water, an altered ratio of muscle mass to fatty tissue, and decreased renal function. Changes in gastrointestinal transit, plasma protein binding, hepatic drug metabolism, and an increased susceptibility to drug-induced cognitive decompensation have also been reported. All these alterations should be considered in geriatric dermatotherapy to minimize drug-related complications caused by over- or underdosage and drug interactions."
6714886	"The outcome of T-cell-mediated responses, immunity or tolerance, critically depends on the balance of cytopathic versus regulatory T (T(reg)) cells. In the creation of stable tolerance to MHC incompatible allografts, reducing the unusually large mass of donor-reactive cytopathic T effector (T(eff)) cells via apoptosis is often required. Cyclosporine (CsA) blocks activation-induced cell death (AICD) of T(eff) cells, and is detrimental to tolerance induction by costimulation blockade, whereas Rapamycin (RPM) preserves AICD, and augments the potential of costimulation blockade to create tolerance. While differences between CsA and RPM in influencing apoptosis of activated graft-destructive T(eff) cells are apparent, their effects on graft-protective T(reg) cells remain enigmatic. Moreover, it is unclear whether tolerizing regimens foster conversion of naïve peripheral T cells into alloantigen-specific T(reg) cells for graft protection. Here we show, using reporter mice for T(reg) marker Foxp3, that RPM promotes de novo conversion of alloantigen-specific T(reg) cells, whereas CsA completely inhibits this process. Upon transfer, in vivo converted T(reg) cells potently suppress the rejection of donor but not third party skin grafts. Thus, the differential effects of RPM and CsA on T(eff) and T(reg) cells favor the use of RPM in shifting the balance of aggressive to protective type alloimmunity."
3165235	"We report the case of a 44-year-old male with a 10-year history of manifestations of the rare form of bullous systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with coexisting antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) that remained undiagnosed until thrombotic-embolic episodes appeared and high titres of anticardiolipin (ACL) antibodies were detected. The patient fulfilled the criteria for SLE and the atypical cutaneous manifestations together with histopathological changes and a favourable response to sulphones were the grounds for the diagnosis of the bullous variety of SLE. Treatment with prednisolone, acenocoumarol and dapsone resulted in marked clinical improvement, reduction in antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) and normalization of ACL antibody titres."
6999756	"Pharmacokinetic sampling was performed in two multicenter trials in which basiliximab (anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody) was administered with triple immunosuppression consisting of cyclosporine microemulsion, corticosteroids, and either azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil. Blood samples were collected over 12 wk post-transplant from 31 azathioprine-treated and 66 mycophenolate mofetil-treated patients. Empirical Bayes estimates of each patient's basiliximab disposition parameters were derived and the duration of CD25 saturation was estimated as the time over which serum concentrations exceeded 0.2 microg/mL as confirmed by flow cytometry measurements. Basiliximab clearance was 29+/-14 mL/h when coadministered with azathioprine and 18+/-8 mL/h with mycophenolate mofetil. Both were significantly lower compared with a clearance of 37+/-15 mL/h from a previous study of basiliximab with dual therapy (p<   0.001). As a consequence of the lower clearance of basiliximab, the durations of CD25 saturation were prolonged in the presence of azathioprine (50+/-20 d; range, 13--84) and mycophenolate mofetil (59+/-17 d; range, 28--94) compared with dual therapy (36+/-14 d; range, 12--91). A total of 27 acute rejection episodes occurred during the first 6 months in the two studies. Durations of CD25 saturation were not different in these patients compared with those who remained rejection-free in each study. A single patient among 57 who were screened developed anti-idiotype antibodies to basiliximab. The average duration of CD25 saturation was prolonged by 39 and 64% in the presence of azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil, respectively. This graded effect was also observed for basiliximab clearance and may be due in part to a differentially reduced humoral response to basiliximab. Nonetheless, the range of CD25 saturation durations and basiliximab clearances did not extend outside the range when basiliximab was used with dual therapy in the absence of these agents. Hence, no dosing adjustment is deemed necessary when basiliximab is used in triple immunosuppressive therapy including either azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil."

This analysis suggests that calcitriol 3µg/g ointment use for 26 weeks (N=249) and 52 weeks (N=130) was associated with disease improvement or stabilization in most patients with plaque psoriasis."
4844313	"Leishmaniasis recidiva cutis (LRC) is an unusual form of acute cutaneous leishmaniasis. Herein, we present a case of LRC of the lips mimicking granulomatous cheilitis. An 8-year-old, Syrian child admitted with a swelling and disfigurement of his lips for 4 years. Abundant intra and extracellular Leishmania amastigotes were determined in the smear prepared from the lesion with Giemsa stain. Histopathology showed foamy histiocytes and leishmania parasites within the cytoplasm of macrophages in the epidermis and a dense dermal mixed type inflammatory cell infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, foamy histiocytes with multinucleated giant cells. On the basis of anamnestic data, the skin smears results, clinical and histopathologic findings, LRC was diagnosed. The patient was treated with meglumine antimoniate intramuscularly and fluconazole orally. Cryotherapy was applied to the residual papular lesions. The lesion improved markedly at the first month of the treatment."
2533441	"The burning mouth syndrome is characterized by burning and painful sensations of the mouth in the absence of significant mucosal abnormalities. For patients in whom no causative factor can be identified, empiric antifungal, nutritional, and estrogen replacement therapy can be initiated. If these fail, long-term therapy with antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and clonazepam can be considered. Topical capsaicin and laser therapy have been reported beneficial in a few patients."
2482640	"Little is known about incidence and natural variation of impetigo in general populations.                                                                                   To investigate the natural course of impetigo in a well-defined population, and to study the resistance pattern of the causal bacteria over time.                                                                              This is a population-based incidence study in Austevoll, an island community of 4457 inhabitants in Norway, in the years 2001-2005. Incidence rates are given as events per person-year. Epidemic periods were identified by statistical process-control analyses.                                                                              The incidence rate of impetigo for the whole study period was 0.017 events per person-year, corresponding to a total of 334 cases. The incidence rates were 0.009, 0.026, 0.019, 0.016 and 0.009 in the years 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. Three epidemics were identified, starting in August of 2002, 2003 and 2004, lasting for 11, 11 and 5 weeks, respectively. Incidence rates in these epidemic periods were 0.099, 0.045 and 0.074, respectively. In epidemic periods, Staphylococcus aureus was the causal bacterium in 89% (117/132) of cases, while this proportion was 68% (84/123) in nonepidemic periods (P <    0.01). Staphylococcus aureus was resistant to fusidic acid in 84% (98/117) and 64% (54/84) of impetigo cases in epidemic and nonepidemic periods, respectively (P <    0.01). When investigating all types of infections caused by S. aureus in the study period, the proportion of fusidic acid resistance in impetigo cases (152/201, 76%) differed significantly from fusidic acid resistance in other infections (18/116, 16%) (P <    0.01).                                                                                      Distinctive epidemic outbreaks occurred during the summer of three of the five follow-up years. In outbreaks, S. aureus was more frequently the causal agent and the sensitivity to fusidic acid decreased significantly."

They belong to several structural types; attention is specially drawn to three original skeletons, namely 7-hydoxy-7-methyl aporphinoids, 7- GEM-dimethyl aporphinoids and alpha- GEM-dimethyl cularinoids. The results concerning solvent shift in (1)H NMR spectra of some of these alkaloids are emphasized. Finally the phytochemical significance of the isolated alkaloids is discussed considering their chemotaxonomic and biogenetic interest."
6875732	"Analysis of hospital attendances for skin diseases is not a true prevalence study; however, it gives valuable information to the dermatologist. A two week study of hospital attendances at the skin clinics in three major hospitals in Western Australia was conducted. The most common conditions encountered were solar keratoses, psoriasis, malignant tumours and dermatitis. These results are similar to those of a population based prevalence study carried out in Western Australian in 1979."
7471386	"Abnormalities of recipient or donor vascular structures are associated with reconstructive difficulties in liver transplantation. A patient with thrombosis of the right hepatic vein and associated stricture of the inferior vena cava (IVC), portal vein thrombosis and multiple aberrant arteries underwent orthotopic liver transplantation. The donor's suprahepatic IVC was anastomosed to the recipient's intrathoracic IVC. The portal vein flow was restored by venous graft interposition, while the arterial flow was ensured by interposing an iliac arterial graft anastomosed to the infrarenal aorta. In conclusion, graft function remains excellent more than 5 years postoperatively."
9494421	"The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of donor race on the outcome of black patients with chronic hepatitis C infection who undergo liver transplantation. The records for deceased donor liver transplants that occurred in the United States between January 1998 and December 2007 were obtained from the United Network for Organ Sharing. 26,212 records contained sufficient data to be included in the analysis. Of these, 11,989 (45.7%) records were for patients positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV) and 1292 (4.9%) were for patients both HCV-positive and black. Black recipients with white donors were found to have significantly worse outcomes than all other recipient-donor race combinations (P <    0.001). The crude 5-year survival rate for black recipients who had a black donor was 14% higher than the 5-year survival rate for black recipients who had a white donor. Multivariate regression analysis determined that a graft from a race-unmatched donor was an independent risk factor for graft failure (hazard ratio = 1.41, 95% confidence interval = 1.11-1.79) among HCV-positive black recipients but not among HCV-negative black recipients after adjustments for donor age, recipient age, cold ischemia time, serum creatinine, serum bilirubin, diabetes mellitus, body mass index, and donor cytomegalovirus status. The observation that race-unmatched grafts are a risk factor in HCV-positive black recipients, but not in HCV-negative black recipients, suggests an alteration of the graft-host relationship by HCV. In conclusion, our results suggest that HCV-positive black recipients who undergo liver transplantation can have increased graft survival if their donors are black, with survival rates approaching those of white liver transplant recipients."
4679499	"Psoriatic plaques have been shown to contain increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Also, serum levels of several cytokines have been reported elevated in psoriatic patients. It is postulated that changes in cytokine production both locally and systemically could be useful in monitoring disease activity. The aim of this study was to evaluate serum cytokine profile of interleukin (IL)-8, γ-interferon (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in Egyptian psoriatic patients by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique and to correlate these levels with disease severity. We analyzed serum samples from 60 Egyptian patients (31 females and 29 males) with a mean age of 40.2 ± 17.4 years with active psoriasis, and 21 healthy volunteers for major T-helper type 1 cytokines using the ELISA technique. The disease severity, including erythema, induration and scales, was assessed by Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score. TNF-α and IFN-γ were markedly elevated in all sera from psoriatic patients. TNF-α was found a more efficient predictor for disease severity than IL-8 and IFN-γ using three receiver-operator curves with accuracy. IL-8 was also moderately elevated and correlated with the age of patients (r = 0.28). We have obtained evidence that TNF-α in our study was found to be more useful than the other two tested cytokines, IL-8 and IFN-γ as a follow-up marker for monitoring disease severity in Egyptian psoriatic patients. A positive correlation between lL-8 and the age of the patients was also noted."
5932758	"Though several suggestions have been put forward, the underlying mechanism of contrast medium-induced nephropathy (CIN) is not clear. Most probably, however, the culprit is a combination of various mechanisms working together to cause the development of CIN. The generally accepted main factors in the pathophysiology of CIN are the reduction in renal perfusion by contrast media (CM) combined with the toxic effects on the tubular cells. With regard to the literature, misconceptions are widespread when explaining the development of CIN, e.g. that osmolar challenge induces renal vasoconstriction due to the tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism (TGF). Although popular, this assumption is most probably false, since osmotic pressure is not the signal for the TGF. Much attention has been paid to reducing the osmolarity of CM further. In an effort to obtain iso-osmolar CM, dimers were formed. These CM have osmolarities in the near physiological range, but at the cost of increased viscosity. This seems to have adverse effects with regard to kidney haemodynamics. In contrast to the multifarious interpretations of CIN, it is generally accepted that hydration is effective in preventing CIN from occuring. There is no universally accepted explanation for the effect of hydration, but it may rely on enhancing renal medullary blood flow and reducing the viscosity of the fluid in the collecting duct."
8418262	"A common urologic complication after pancreas transplantation with bladder drainage is hematuria. However, hematuria is usually mild and self-limiting and rarely requires open surgical intervention. We report an unusual case of refractory hematuria that began 17 days after solitary pancreas transplantation due to severe rejection. The patient developed severe duodenal segment swelling with mucosal rupture that eventually required operative therapy. This case is illustrative of the diagnosis and management of gross hematuria after pancreas transplantation and demonstrates the limitations of cystoscopic techniques. This unusual complication must be considered in the differential diagnosis of refractory hematuria with pancreas allograft dysfunction and may represent a problem unique to solitary pancreas transplantation until better immunosuppressive strategies are available."
2138670	"Radioligand-binding experiments were performed with crude membrane homogenates (CMH) from human skin in order to investigate the epidermal beta-adrenergic receptor (beta AR) density. CMH were prepared from leftovers of split-thickness skin grafts by sequential homogenization and centrifugation procedures to yield essentially epidermal fragments. Saturation experiments with the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (-)-[125I]-iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) as radioligand showed saturable specific binding isotherms. Scatchard transformation of the data demonstrated high-affinity binding of ICYP to a single class of beta AR (Bmax = 80 +/- 10 fmol/mg protein; KD = 8 pM +/- 0.9; n = 8). beta AR antagonists displaced ICYP in a monophasic displacement pattern. The IC50 values were (nmol/1) propranolol (non-selective) 24.8; ICI 118,551 (beta 2 selective) 14.7; CGP-12177 (non-selective) 28.9; bisoprolol (beta 1 selective) 1500; CGP-20712A (beta 1 selective) 8990. beta AR agonists displaced ICYP with a potency ranking isoprenaline greater than adrenaline greater than noradrenaline. We conclude that epidermal crude membrane homogenates prepared from human split-thickness skin contain a high population of beta 2-adrenergic receptors. These receptors may be studied to further investigate the nature of human epidermal beta-adrenergic mechanisms."
9376781	"Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita is an inflammatory subepidermal bullous disease characterized by circulating and tissue-bound complement-binding anti-basement membrane zone autoantibodies to type VII procollagen. Lesions are characterized by neutrophil-predominant inflammation in some patients, but not in others. These features suggest complement activation and generation of complement-derived chemotactic factors for leukocytes by basement membrane zone immune complexes may contribute to inflammation, but that complexes may be heterogeneous in the ability to express that function. In this study, we measured the ability of basement membrane zone complexes from patients with (n = 4) and without (n = 6) neutrophil predominant inflammation to activate complement and generate complement-derived chemotactic activity using a complement-dependent neutrophil attachment assay. The results showed considerable heterogeneity in neutrophil attachment among EBA patients and that both the incidence (4/4 vs 2/6) and magnitude (81 +/- 34 vs 12 +/- 10 neutrophils/mm basement membrane zone) of attachment were greater in patients with neutrophil-predominant inflammation. Functional heterogeneity appeared to be due to differences in the amounts of complement-activating complexes formed at the basement membrane zone, which in turn appeared to be due to differences in the availability of circulating complement-binding anti-basement membrane zone antibodies. This was suggested by a positive correlation (r = 0.72, p less than 0.01) between neutrophil attachment and complement-binding anti-basement membrane zone antibody titers and the observation that high levels of neutrophil attachment could be generated in skin from patients with epidermolysis bullosa acquisita who did not have neutrophil-predominant inflammation by treating their skin in vitro with complement-binding anti-basement membrane zone antibodies. These results suggest tissue complexes in epidermolysis bullosa acquisita are heterogeneous in the ability to activate complement and generate complement-derived chemotactins (C5a, C5a des arg), and that functional heterogeneity contributes to histologic heterogeneity. The functional immunologic-pathologic correlations observed in this study suggest epidermolysis bullosa acquisita is an autoimmune ""collagen"" disease."
2922069	"New models of health care delivery for dermatological care have the potential to increase access and improve patient-centered outcomes.                                                                                  To compare effectiveness of a direct-access, online model for follow-up dermatologic care in pediatric and adult patients with atopic dermatitis with that of in-person office visits.                                                                                                        This was a 1-year, randomized controlled equivalency clinical trial in medically underserved areas, outpatient clinics, and the general community. Participants included children and adults with atopic dermatitis with access to the Internet, computers, and digital cameras.                                                                                    After an initial in-person visit, patients were randomized 1:1 to direct-access online or usual in-person care for follow-up management of atopic dermatitis. In the direct-access online group, patients captured and transmitted clinical images and history asynchronously to dermatologists online; dermatologists evaluated the clinical information, provided recommendations and education, and prescribed medications online asynchronously. In the in-person group, patients visited dermatologists in their offices for follow-up care.

A total of 156 children and adults were randomized. Between baseline and 12 months, the mean (SD) within-group difference in POEM score in patients in the direct-access online group was -5.1 (5.48) (95% CI, -6.32 to -3.88); in the in-person group, the within-group difference was -4.86 (4.87) (95% CI, -6.27 to -3.46). The difference in the change in POEM scores between the 2 groups was 0.24 (6.59) (90% CI, -1.70 to 1.23), which was contained within the predetermined 2.5 equivalence margin. The percentage of patients achieving clearance or near-clearance of their disease (IGA score of 0 or 1) was 38.4% (95% CI, 27.7% to 49.3%) in the direct-access online group and 43.6% (95% CI, 32.6%-54.6%) in the in-person group. The difference in the percent of patients achieving clearance or near-clearance between the 2 groups was 5.1% (90% CI, 1.7%-8.6%), which was contained within the predetermined 10% equivalence margin.                                                                                                    The direct-access online model results in equivalent improvements in atopic dermatitis clinical outcomes as in-person care. Direct-access online care may represent an innovative model of delivering dermatological services to patients with chronic skin diseases.                                                                                            clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00985894."
8309721	"1. Kidneys from female donors between the ages of 31 and 50 had consistently poorer graft survival rates than kidneys from male donors or younger female donors. 2. Sensitized first cadaver kidney recipients of older female donor kidneys had a one-year graft survival rate of 65% as compared with 82% in recipients of young male donor grafts (p less than 0.001). Retransplanted recipients of older female donor grafts had a one-year graft survival rate of 48% as compared with 70% in recipients of young male donor kidneys (p less than 0.001). 3. The effects on graft survival of donor age and sex were considerably greater than the effect of cold ischemia in excess of 36 hours. 4. The cause of donor death was a risk factor for sensitized and regraft recipients. In data from 45 transplant centers, sensitized first transplant recipients of nontrauma donor kidneys had a one-year graft survival rate of 67% versus 78% (p = NS) for recipients of trauma donor kidneys. Regraft recipients of nontrauma donor grafts had a one-year graft survival rate of 55% versus 67% (p less than 0.05) for recipients of trauma donor kidneys. 5. The cause of donor death effect and the effects of donor age and sex may be related as older female donors accounted for 37% of nontrauma donors and only 7% of trauma donors were older females. 6. A surprisingly high percentage of older female (6%) and nontrauma donor kidneys (3%) failed on the first day posttransplant in regrafted patients. A very sensitive crossmatch may help reduce the number of immediate failures. 7. HLA matching improved graft survival of female donor kidneys to a greater extent than male donor kidneys in regrafted patients. With zero or one mismatch at HLA-B,DR there was no difference in one-year graft survival between male and female donor kidneys. In first cadaver transplants, the difference in graft survival between older female and young male donor grafts was minimized by very good matching. Matching also abrogated the donor sex and age effects in living-related donor transplants. 8. Sensitized patients and patients who have previously rejected a kidney should be given priority for young male trauma donor organs when these become available."
5958426	"Depiction of the genetic diversity, linkage disequilibrium (LD) and population structure is essential for the efficient organization and exploitation of genetic resources. The objectives of this study were to (i) to evaluate the genetic diversity and to detect the patterns of LD, (ii) to estimate the levels of population structure and (iii) to identify a 'core collection' suitable for association genetic studies in sweet cherry.                                                                              A total of 210 genotypes including modern cultivars and landraces from 16 countries were genotyped using the RosBREED cherry 6 K SNP array v1. Two groups, mainly bred cultivars and landraces, respectively, were first detected using STRUCTURE software and confirmed by Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA). Further analyses identified nine subgroups using STRUCTURE and Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC). Several sub-groups correspond to different eco-geographic regions of landraces distribution. Linkage disequilibrium was evaluated showing lower values than in peach, the reference Prunus species. A 'core collection' containing 156 accessions was selected using the maximum length sub tree method.                                                                                     The present study constitutes the first population genetics analysis in cultivated sweet cherry using a medium-density SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) marker array. We provided estimations of linkage disequilibrium, genetic structure and the definition of a first INRA's Sweet Cherry core collection useful for breeding programs, germplasm management and association genetics studies."
6889367	"Postharvest senescence in broccoli (Brassica oleracea L. var Italica) florets results in phenotypic changes similar to those seen in developmental leaf senescence. To compare these two processes in more detail, we investigated molecular and biochemical changes in broccoli florets stored at two different temperatures after harvest. We found that storage at cooler temperatures delayed the symptoms of senescence at both the biochemical and gene expression levels. Changes in key biochemical components (lipids, protein, and chlorophyll) and in gene expression patterns occurred in the harvested tissue well before any visible signs of senescence were detected. Using previously identified senescence-enhanced genes and also newly isolated, differentially expressed genes, we found that the majority of these showed a similar enhancement of expression in postharvest broccoli as in developmental leaf senescence. At the biochemical level, a rapid loss of membrane fatty acids was detected after harvest, when stored at room temperature. However, there was no corresponding increase in levels of lipid peroxidation products. This, together with an increased expression of protective antioxidant genes, indicated that, in the initial stages of postharvest senescence, an orderly dismantling of the cellular constituents occurs, using the available lipid as an energy source. Postharvest changes in broccoli florets, therefore, show many similarities to the processes of developmental leaf senescence."
7567240	"The immediate response of erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) skin to long-wave ultraviolet radiation (UVR) was studied with the electron microscope. The main finding was severe vascular injury. This was confined to the superficial vessels of the dermis and consisted of endothelial cell degeneration and a pronounced leakage of vascular contents. In contrast, the epidermis showed no abnormalities. Short-wave UV irradiation of EPP skin resulted in epidermal changes typical for the usual sunburn reaction and spared the dermal blood vessels. The following conclusions are drawn: (i) Endothelial cells are the primary cellular target for the photodynamic reaction in EPP. (ii) The fibrillar material, characteristic for chronic EPP lesions, originates from the vessels and vascular contents. (iii) The multilayered basement membranes observed in such lesions reflect multiple consecutive reparative processes that follow endothelial injuries."
8915826	"Formation of the generative cell in flowering plants initiates the male spermatogenesis pathway which eventually culminates in the process of double fertilization. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms operative in the generative cell. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of cDNA clones encoding generative cell-specific histones, gcH2A and gcH3. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that both genes are activated after formation of the generative cell and accumulation of transcripts increases progressively during generative cell maturation. These results suggest that gcH2A and gcH3 mRNAs are products of transcriptional activation of the generative cell nucleus and thus provide the first evidence for male germ line cell-specific gene expression in flowering plants."
2515805	"Central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) is the most detrimental neurologic complication after liver transplantation. The incidence of CPM after liver transplantation ascends to 17%. Although the precise etiology and pathogenesis of CPM is largely unknown, a growing literature implicates a possible role of immunosuppressive agents, such as Cyclosporine (incidence 30%) on its development. Other immunosuppressive agents also can cause CPM but the frequency of these cases is less compared to Cyclosporine. There is only one case report for Tacrolimus (FK506)-associated speech disorder, which might be an atypical presentation of CPM, and no case reports for Rapamycin. We present a case of Tacrolimus induced CPM.                                                                                  A 62-year-old woman who underwent liver transplantation developed clinical symptoms with radiologic evidence consistent with CPM 7 days after liver transplant. Since the electrolytes in this patient remained normal from her admission, the hypothesis of inmunossupressor neurotoxicity was established and the therapy was switched, resulting in an evident clinical and radiological improvement of her condition in the following days. Five months later, the patient's only neurological deficit was slight dysarthria and a follow-up MRI showed no abnormalities.

All diagnoses except brachioradial photodermatitis were confirmed by histopathologic examination. After adjusting for race/ethnicity and occupation, sleeping in previously flooded huts was statistically significantly (adjusted odds ratio, 20.4; 95% confidence interval, 5.9-70.2) associated with developing papular urticaria, the most common cause of rash in this cluster.                                                                                      We identified 4 distinct clinical entities, although most workers were diagnosed as having papular urticaria. Huts previously flooded as a result of the hurricanes and used for sleeping may have harbored mites, a likely source of papular urticaria. To reduce the morbidity of hurricane-related skin diseases, we suggest avoiding flooded areas, fumigating with an acaricide, and wearing protective clothing."
7599497	"Masson pine (Pinus massoniana L.) trees in the Pearl River Delta have shown growth decline since late 1980s, particularly those around industrially polluted regions. As nitrogen is an important nutritional element composing functional proteins, structural proteins and photosynthetic machinery, investigation on nitrogen allocation is helpful to understand nutrient alteration and its regulation mechanism in response to pollution stress. Current year (C) and 1-year old needles (C + 1) of five mature trees were sampled in industrially polluted site and unpolluted natural reserve for bioassay. Needles of declining trees had significantly higher leaf nitrogen per unit area (N(L)) but lower photosynthetic capacity (P (max)), which resulted in lower photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency (PNUE) than those of healthy trees. Nitrogen fraction to the photosynthetic apparatus in the C and C + 1 needles at polluted site was 27 and 22%, significantly lower than the corresponding healthy needles (48 and 32%). The content of structural proteins was positively correlated with N(L) in C and C + 1 needles. Moreover, the C and C + 1 needles of declining trees had about 1.8 times structural protein as those of healthy trees, suggesting that more nitrogen allocation to structural protein are needed for stronger structural defenses under polluted stress. Decreases in PNUE of declining pine trees could be partially explained by increases in structural protein nitrogen."
7554049	"Starch-debranching enzymes (DBEs) are key enzymes involved in starch metabolism in cereals, having a dual function, in both starch synthesis and degradation. However, their precise roles in this pathway, particularly their expression profiles, remain unclear. In the present study, we performed a quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) analysis of the expression pattern of the OsPUL gene encoding a pullulanase-type DBE in different tissues as well as in seeds at different developmental stages. The results showed that this gene was expressed only in seeds. In addition, the 1177-bp OsPUL promoter sequence was cloned, and some endosperm-specific motifs such as the GCN4 and AACA motifs were observed to exist in this region. The promoter was then fused with the GUS reporter gene and its expression was carefully investigated in transgenic rice. The data from both histochemical and fluorometric analyses showed that the OsPUL promoter was capable of driving the target gene to have a high level of endosperm-specific expression. The OsPUL gene maintained a relatively high expression level during the entire period of seed development, and peaked in the middle and late stages. This observation was very consistent with that of the endogenous transcription analysis by Q-PCR. Furthermore, the seed germination experiment showed that the OsPUL promoter actively functions in the late stage of seed germination. The expression of the OsPUL gene was maintained at a significant level during the entire grain filling period and in the late stage of seed germination, which coincided with its involvement in starch anabolism and catabolism."

7833256	"The position of the pulsed dye laser (PDL) in the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases is still unclear. Evidence-based recommendations are lacking.                                                                                   We sought to systematically review all available literature concerning PDL treatment for inflammatory skin diseases and to propose a recommendation.                                                                              We searched for publications dated between January 1992 and August 2011 in the database PubMed. All studies reporting on PDL treatment for an inflammatory skin disease were obtained and a level of evidence was determined.                                                                              Literature search revealed 52 articles that could be included in this study. The inflammatory skin diseases treated with PDL consisted of: psoriasis, acne vulgaris, lupus erythematodes, granuloma faciale, sarcoidosis, eczematous lesions, papulopustular rosacea, lichen sclerosis, granuloma annulare, Jessner lymphocytic infiltration of the skin, and reticular erythematous mucinosis. The efficacy of PDL laser treatment for these inflammatory skin diseases was described and evaluated.                                                                                      Most conclusions formulated are not based on randomized controlled trials.                                                                                      PDL treatment can be recommended as an effective and safe treatment for localized plaque psoriasis and acne vulgaris (recommendation grade B). For all other described inflammatory skin diseases, PDL seems to be promising, although the level of recommendation did not exceed level C."
8436475	"Adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) release from keratinocytes has been observed in various stress models in vitro, but studies demonstrating epidermal ATP release in vivo are limited. To visualize extracellular ATP (eATP) in vivo, we developed enhanced green-emitting luciferase immobilized on agarose beads (Eluc-agarose). Subcutaneous injection of Eluc-agarose together with ATP into the dorsal skin of BALB/c mice following intraperitoneal luciferin injection produced detectable and measurable bioluminescence using an in vivo imaging system. Using Eluc-agarose, we demonstrated in vivo that bright bioluminescence was observed from 1 to 20 minutes after repeated tape stripping of murine skin. This bioluminescence was suppressed by the local administration of apyrase. Eluc-agarose bioluminescence was observed only in tape-stripped skin with transepidermal water loss (TEWL) between 100 and 140 g m(2) h(-1), indicating a loss of bioluminescence with excessive tape stripping (TEWL>   140 g m(-2) h(-1)). Histologically, tape-stripped skin with detectable eATP had a viable epidermis and a subepidermal neutrophil infiltrate, and administration of apyrase reduced the inflammatory infiltrate. Neither a viable epidermis nor an upper dermal neutrophil infiltrate was observed after excessive tape stripping. These results suggest that tape stripping prompts ATP release from viable keratinocytes, which facilitates inflammatory cell migration. Eluc-agarose may be useful in the in vivo detection of eATP in murine models of skin diseases."
4929259	"Condyloma acuminatum is one of the most commonly occurring sexually transmitted diseases. HNP1 is a small antimicrobial peptide that has been reported to have antiviral activities.                                                                            Using the condyloma acuminatum tissue culture to resemble the situation more closely in vivo, we investigate the therapeutic effect of a recombinant plasmid encoding HNP1 gene in condyloma acuminatum tissue.                                                                              Recombinant plasmid DNA carrying HNP1 cDNA was constructed and identified. Then the recombinant plasmid was transfected into a condyloma acuminatum tissue fragment, and the HNP1 expression was determined on these tissue fragments by immunohistochemistry. TUNEL staining and flow cytometry techniques were used to examine cell apoptosis of condyloma acuminatum tissue. Relative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to validate antihuman papillomavirus therapeutics of the treatment groups.                                                                              Transfected HNP1 gene was expressed mainly in the cytoplasmic granules of the condyloma acuminatum tissues. Positive apoptotic cells were observed in condyloma acuminatum tissues transfected with the HNP1 gene. In addition, the HPV expression was lower in the HNP1 treatment tissues as compared to their corresponding control tissues.                                                                                     The results indicate that HNP1 can directly promote condyloma acuminatum cell apoptosis and play an antivirus role in the condyloma acuminatum tissue by limiting viral replication. These observations suggest a possible application for human HNP1 on condyloma acuminatum therapy."
6541454	"The viviparous-1 (vp1) gene in maize controls multiple developmental responses associated with the maturation phase of seed formation. Most notably, mutant embryos have reduced sensitivity to the hormone abscisic acid, resulting in precocious germination, and blocked anthocyanin synthesis in aleurone and embryo tissues. The Vp1 locus was cloned by transposon tagging, using the Robertson's Mutator element present in the vp1-mum1 mutant allele. Detection of DNA rearrangements in several spontaneous and transposable element-induced mutant vp1 alleles, including a partial deletion of the locus, confirmed the identity of the clone. The Vp1 gene encodes a 2500-nucleotide mRNA that is expressed specifically in embryo and endosperm tissues of the developing seed. This transcript is absent in seed tissues of vp1 mutant stocks. Expression of C1, a regulatory gene for the anthocyanin pathway, is selectively blocked at the mRNA level in vp1 mutant seed tissues, indicating the Vp1 may control the anthocyanin pathway by regulating C1. We suggest that the Vp1 gene product functions to potentiate multiple signal transduction pathways in specific seed tissues."
2516178	"Protein extracts obtained from dried and fresh roots of Phytolacca americana L. (Phytolaccaceae) were examined in order to identify and characterise individual proteins. The extracts were compared with a commercial pokeweed mitogen standard using SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). A dominant protein, present in both the extracts and the pokeweed mitogen standard, was isolated by subsequent ammonium sulphate fractionation, anion exchange chromatography, gel filtration and SDS-PAGE. In this way it was purified 140-fold with about 20 % yield and 70-fold with about 13 % yield from dried and fresh roots, respectively. Its molecular mass as determined by gel filtration and SDS-PAGE was estimated to be about 25 kDa. Subsequent isoelectric focussing revealed one single protein band at pH 6.0. LysC digestion of the 25 kDa protein yielded several peptides which were subjected to micro-sequencing. Comparison with published sequences revealed that the protein isolated was phytolacain G, a cysteine protease previously isolated from unripe fruits of P. americana L. The enzyme showed a high affinity towards the oxidised insulin B-chain and was completely inhibited by trans-epoxysuccinyl- L-leucylamido(4-guanidino)-butane (E64). The purified phytolacain G showed ""lectin-like"" activities such as haemagglutination and mitogenic effects towards human lymphocytes."

1337201	"Targeted mutagenesis, editing of endogenous maize (Zea mays) genes, and site-specific insertion of a trait gene using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated (Cas)-guide RNA technology are reported in maize. DNA vectors expressing maize codon-optimized Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 endonuclease and single guide RNAs were cointroduced with or without DNA repair templates into maize immature embryos by biolistic transformation targeting five different genomic regions: upstream of the liguleless1 (LIG1) gene, male fertility genes (Ms26 and Ms45), and acetolactate synthase (ALS) genes (ALS1 and ALS2). Mutations were subsequently identified at all sites targeted, and plants containing biallelic multiplex mutations at LIG1, Ms26, and Ms45 were recovered. Biolistic delivery of guide RNAs (as RNA molecules) directly into immature embryo cells containing preintegrated Cas9 also resulted in targeted mutations. Editing the ALS2 gene using either single-stranded oligonucleotides or double-stranded DNA vectors as repair templates yielded chlorsulfuron-resistant plants. Double-strand breaks generated by RNA-guided Cas9 endonuclease also stimulated insertion of a trait gene at a site near LIG1 by homology-directed repair. Progeny showed expected Mendelian segregation of mutations, edits, and targeted gene insertions. The examples reported in this study demonstrate the utility of Cas9-guide RNA technology as a plant genome editing tool to enhance plant breeding and crop research needed to meet growing agriculture demands of the future."
8394036	"Recently, a deletion of two late cornified envelope (LCE) genes within the epidermal differentiation complex on chromosome 1 was shown to be overrepresented in 1,426 psoriasis vulgaris (PsV) patients of European ancestry. In this study, we report a confirmation of this finding in 1,354 PsV patients and 937 control individuals of German origin. We found an allele frequency of the deletion of 70.9% in PsV patients and of 64.9% in control individuals (chi(2)=17.44, P=2.97 x 10(-5), odds ratio (95% confidence interval)=1.31 (1.15-1.48)). The overall copy number of the two LCE genes had no influence on the age of onset, but we observed a dosage effect at the genotype level. There was no evidence of statistically significant interaction with copy number of the beta-defensin cluster on 8p23.1 or with an IL-23R pathway variant in a combined data set of German and Dutch individuals, whereas evidence for interaction with the PSORS1 risk allele in German individuals was marginal and did not remain significant after correction for multiple testing. Our study confirms the recently published finding that the deletion of the two LCE genes is a susceptibility factor for PsV with dosage effect, while, because of power limitation, no final conclusion regarding interaction with other PsV risk factors can be made at this stage."
8838456	"New patients treated for end-stage renal disease are increasingly elderly: in France, 38% are 75 years or older. The best treatment choices for the elderly are still debated.                                                                              We studied case-mix factors associated with choice of initial dialysis modality and 2-year survival in the 3512 patients aged 75 years or older who started dialysis between 2002 and 2005 and were included in the French REIN registry.                                                                              Overall, 18% began with peritoneal dialysis (PD), 50% with planned haemodialysis (planned HD) and 32% with unplanned HD, that is, HD that started on an emergency basis. At least one comorbid condition was reported for 85%, and three or more for 36%, but case-mix varied with age. PD was chosen significantly more often than planned HD for the oldest (>    or =85) compared with the youngest (75-79) patients: odds ratio 2.1 (95% confidence interval, 1.5-2.8), in those with congestive heart failure: 1.8 (1.5-2.3) and severe behavioural disorder: 2.2 (1.3-3.5), but less often for obese patients: 0.5 (0.3-0.8) and smokers: 0.4 (0.2-0.9). Two-year survival rates were 58, 52 and 39% in patients aged 75-79, 80-84 and >    or =85, respectively. Compared with planned HD, unplanned HD was associated with a risk of mortality 50% higher, and PD with a risk 30% higher, independent of patient case-mix.                                                                                     PD is a common treatment option in French elderly patients, but our study suggests the need for caution in the long-term use. The high frequency of unplanned HD would require further attention."
1687364	"Transgenic (Tg) mouse models of autoimmunity have been used to express model antigens that can be recognized by T cells or by autoantibodies. To identify mechanisms of CD8-mediated tissue-specific autoimmune reactions and to identify potential treatments, we generated a double-transgenic (DTg) murine model of autoimmunity by crossing keratin-14 (K14)-soluble chicken ovalbumin (sOVA) mice, which express sOVA predominantly in external ear skin, with OT-I mice whose CD8 T cells express Vα2/Vβ5 regions of the TCR and are specific for SIINFEKL peptide (chicken ovalbumin (OVA) peptide 257-264) in association with class I major histocompatibility complex. The K14-sOVA/OT-I DTg mice develop a destructive process selectively targeting the external ear pinnae in the first 6 days of life. The ear bud area develops an intense inflammatory infiltrate of OT-I cells. Administration of the SIINFEKL peptide intravenously to pregnant F1 (filial 1, first filial generation of animal offspring from cross-mating two parental types) mice and subsequently intraperitoneally to newborn pups resulted in normal external ear development. Treatment with this self-peptide markedly reduced OT-I cell numbers, as well as downregulated the CD8 co-receptor. This model can be useful in studying localized, tissue-specific, immune-mediated skin disease, and provide information about potential therapies for autoimmune diseases in which specific molecular targets are known."
8803222	"The popularity of cosmetic procedures for rejuvenating the face has undergone enormous growth over the past few years, such that at least one in four cosmetic procedures involves the use of soft-tissue augmentation. Of note is the trend away from surgical interventions and toward noninvasive cosmetic procedures, which now account for the majority of all cosmetic procedures performed in the United States. Adult patients of all ages are selecting soft-tissue augmentation, either as a precursor to or a substitute for surgery; there is a trend toward the use of injectable devices in younger patients (aged 35 - 50 years). Patients in different age groups have diverse treatment needs ranging from the correction of fine lines and wrinkles in younger patients to volume restoration in older patients. Thus, the treatment needs will dictate the treatment approach, particularly with injectable filler treatments. The aesthetic physician needs to help the patient understand and select the most appropriate rejuvenating treatment based on a variety of factors, specifically, patient age, motivating factors, timing, cosmetic area to be addressed, and desired outcome. This article suggests a series of steps to help determine the most appropriate approach for volume restoration with injectable devices for satisfying patient treatment expectations."
3200504	"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is associated with an increased incidence of other opportunistic infections in organ transplant recipients. Whether this is related to immunomodulating effects of CMV or independent of CMV but associated with a host risk factor common to both infections is unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the reduction in CMV infections seen with prophylactic ganciclovir treatment after heart transplantation is associated with a reduced incidence of other opportunistic infections. Of 149 patients prospectively enrolled in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of ganciclovir to prevent CMV disease, 74 patients enrolled at this center (33 control and 41 ganciclovir-treated) were retrospectively identified. All received prophylactic OKT-3 and standard 3 drug maintenance immunosuppressive therapy. Actuarial survival and rejection rates and incidence of opportunistic infections (bacterial, fungal, and protozoal) for the 2 treatment groups were determined and compared using Cox-Mantel analysis. CMV disease occurred 2.5 times more frequently in the control group. There were no significant differences in survival or rejection rates nor in bacterial or protozoal infection incidence between the 2 groups. Bacterial infections occurred in 54% of control and 39% of ganciclovir-treated patients (P = 0.18). There were significantly fewer fungal infections in the ganciclovir-treated group (7% vs. 27%, P = 0.0071). CMV and fungal infections were both significantly reduced in patients who received ganciclovir prophylaxis. This suggests that active CMV disease may be causally associated with the development of opportunistic fungal infections."
5367831	"The salt stress-induced SALT-OVERLY-SENSITIVE (SOS) pathway in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) involves the perception of a calcium signal by the SOS3 and SOS3-like CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEIN8 (SCaBP8) calcium sensors, which then interact with and activate the SOS2 protein kinase, forming a complex at the plasma membrane that activates the SOS1 Na⁺/H⁺ exchanger. It has recently been reported that phosphorylation of SCaBP proteins by SOS2-like protein kinases (PKSs) stabilizes the interaction between the two proteins as part of a regulatory mechanism that was thought to be common to all SCaBP and PKS proteins. Here, we report the calcium-independent activation of PKS24 by SCaBP1 and show that activation is dependent on interaction of PKS24 with the C-terminal tail of SCaBP1. However, unlike what has been found for other PKS-SCaBP pairs, multiple amino acids in SCaBP1 are phosphorylated by PKS24, and this phosphorylation is dependent on the interaction of the proteins through the PKS24 FISL motif and on the efficient activation of PKS24 by the C-terminal tail of SCaBP1. In addition, we show that Thr-211 and Thr-212, which are not common phosphorylation sites in the conserved PFPF motif found in most SCaBP proteins, are important for this activation. Finally, we also found that SCaBP1-regulated PKS24 kinase activity is important for inactivating the Arabidopsis plasma membrane proton-translocating adenosine triphosphatase. Together, these results suggest the existence of a novel SCaBP-PKS regulatory mechanism in plants."

There are currently a wide variety of treatment modalities available for acne scarring. The most widely used options are reviewed.
3678871	"Fibroblasts from scaffold-based three-dimensional human cultures have been demonstrated to colonize ulcer wound beds and persist for at least 6 mo without rejection. This study examines the expression in these cultures of molecules associated with activation of the immune system in acute rejection. Studies in monolayer cultures showed that fibroblasts expressed CD40 at about 10% of the surface density seen in umbilical vein endothelial cells, whereas HLA-DR was undetectable. In these cultures, both molecules were induced by gamma-interferon. In scaffold-based three-dimensional cultures, however, a majority of the fibroblasts showed little induction of CD40 and HLA-DR in response to gamma-interferon, although HLA class I expression was increased. Fibroblasts re- isolated from the three-dimensional cultures and cultured in monolayers recovered HLA-DR induction in response to gamma-interferon. Fibroblasts cultured in an alternative three-dimensional system using collagen gels showed CD40 and HLA-DR induction by gamma-interferon in the same manner as monolayer cultures. Comparison of phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 on tyrosine-701 showed it to be similar in monolayer and three-dimensional culture, and phospho-signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 moved into the nucleus. Induction of the class II transcription activator was greatly reduced, however. We propose that interaction of fibroblasts with the fibroblast-derived extracellular matrix is an important modulator of gamma-interferon responsiveness and that this interaction may play a role in the low immunogenicity of allogeneic fibroblasts grown on scaffolds."
7386463	"Acne vulgaris is a multifactorial disease of the skin. Several studies have shown that sebocyte proliferation and/or lipogenesis, as well as inflammatory reactions, may be regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ-mediated pathways.                                                                            To investigate whether the Pro12Ala polymorphism of the PPARγ gene might be associated with the risk of acne, and to assess the effect of this polymorphism on acne severity.                                                                              This case-control study enrolled 100 patients with acne and 100 apparently healthy subjects. The clinical grade of acne was assessed using the Global Acne Grading System. We used PCR to identify the presence of the Pro12Ala polymorphism in exon 2 of PPARγ.                                                                              Our results revealed a statistically significant difference (P = 0.001) in the genotype distribution between patients and controls, with higher incidence of the Pro/Ala genotype in controls (51%) than in patients (28%). A statistically significant association (P <    0.001) between disease severity and genotype distribution was found, indicating that the Pro/Ala genotype is less prevalent in patients with severe acne.                                                                                      Our results suggest that that the Ala allele might be a protective factor against acne development or may attenuate acne severity."
5151954	"Reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium chloride, a redox indicator, by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide diaphorase produces in frozen tissue sections an intense blue cytoplasmic pigment. The activity of this enzyme has been shown to subside immediately upon cell death. Twelve patients with port-wine stains were treated with an argon laser. Frozen tissue sections from biopsy specimens obtained before and 10 minutes, 24 hours, and 48 hours after laser application were processed for nitroblue tetrazolium chloride staining. In normal skin all epidermal and dermal cells displayed dense cytoplasmic blue granular pigment that spared the nuclei. In port-wine stains the laser-induced coagulation necrosis was first seen as an arc-shaped, sharply demarcated, unstained, nitroblue tetrazolium chloride-negative area. Initiation of epidermal repair could be observed in all 48-hour sections. The nitroblue tetrazolium chloride method, when compared with hematoxylin and eosin staining, allowed an easier and more accurate definition of laser injury because of the color difference between damaged and normal tissue."
6851775	"Treatment of pityriasis rubra pilaris is still challenging. We here present a 74-year-old woman who had not experienced stable remission of her skin symptoms during prior treatments including topical and systemic corticosteroids, phototherapy, orally administered acitretin, cyclosporine, methotrexate and adalimumab. A therapy with oral alitretinoin was started and tolerated very well. After a few weeks, skin condition improved significantly and itching and scaling disappeared. The present case shows that alitretinoin might be an alternative in the treatment of recalcitrant pityriasis rubra pilaris type I. Further studies are needed to investigate the benefit of this encouraging result."
6106449	"The genus Helleborus comprises 22 species, which are allocated to six sections. H. x hybridus and H. niger, which belong to different Helleborus sections, are economically important ornamentals. Several other species with minor impact exhibit interesting features, e.g. flower size, flower colour, foliage, scent and disease resistance, which should be introgressed into H. x hybridus or H. niger through interspecific hybridisation. The aims of this study were to investigate whether and which kind of hybridisation barriers occur in crosses between Helleborus species and if they differ in their manifestations, depending on the genetic distance of the respective partners. In order to obtain interspecific hybrids despite crossing barriers, a method to overcome these barriers should be developed. Crossing barriers in Helleborus were localised as predominantly post-zygotic according to in situ pollen tube staining with aniline blue. For certain crosses, pre-zygotic barriers could also be assumed, but pollen tube growth was not totally inhibited. Therefore, embryo rescue techniques via ovule culture were established to overcome the post-zygotic barriers. Ovules were isolated from maternal plants 5-7 weeks after pollination in most cases and then cultured in vitro. Overall, 219 hybrids were successfully obtained, of which 16 were derived from inter-sectional crosses. Hybrids were verified by flow cytometry and/or by molecular DNA markers."

While the utilization rate of complementary therapies by the general population has been estimated to be as high as 45%, and nurses are interacting with clients who use these therapies on a daily basis, little is known about nurses' attitudes, knowledge, or perceived efficacy of the therapies."
9711220	"Although originally conceived as a basis for malignant cell growth, autocrine signaling networks are currently known to be activated during tissue repair and with in vitro cultivation. In human epidermal keratinocytes, activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor by cognate ligands mediates the majority of the autonomous replicative capacity of these cells and is necessary to inhibit differentiation and apoptosis. The importance of heparin-binding growth factors in activation of this receptor was first suggested by the strong anti-proliferative effects of soluble heparin-like molecules on keratinocyte growth. This and related evidence led to the identification of amphiregulin as a major autocrine factor for keratinocytes. The binding of amphiregulin and its homolog, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor, to the receptor is potentially amplified by autoinduction and cross-signaling through epidermal growth factor-related polypeptides and by transmodulation of other ErbB-family receptors (HER-2, -3, -4) in cells expressing these receptors. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans and the tetraspanin family of membrane-associated proteins appear to act as cofactors in amphiregulin-driven mitogenesis mediated by the epidermal growth factor receptor, but amphiregulin's immunolocalization to keratinocyte nuclei and to filopodia may indicate other potentially novel effects. Following from the observation that amphiregulin is overexpressed in lesional psoriatic epidermis, the importance of amphiregulin in hyperproliferative skin diseases has been further supported by recent studies of the targeted expression of a transgene encoding keratin 14 promoter-driven human amphiregulin to the basal epidermis of mice. Founder transgenic mice displayed a morphologic and microscopic cutaneous phenotype that shares characteristics with psoriasis. Pharmacologic regulation of amphiregulin's expression and receptor signaling may eventually prove to be an effective strategy in the treatment of hyperproliferative skin diseases."
9819323	"Plant sulfite reductase (SiR; Enzyme Commission 1.8.7.1) catalyzes the reduction of sulfite to sulfide in the reductive sulfate assimilation pathway. Comparison of SiR expression in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum 'Rheinlands Ruhm') and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants revealed that SiR is expressed in a different tissue-dependent manner that likely reflects dissimilarity in sulfur metabolism between the plant species. Using Arabidopsis and tomato SiR mutants with modified SiR expression, we show here that resistance to ectopically applied sulfur dioxide/sulfite is a function of SiR expression levels and that plants with reduced SiR expression exhibit higher sensitivity than the wild type, as manifested in pronounced leaf necrosis and chlorophyll bleaching. The sulfite-sensitive mutants accumulate applied sulfite and show a decline in glutathione levels. In contrast, mutants that overexpress SiR are more tolerant to sulfite toxicity, exhibiting little or no damage. Resistance to high sulfite application is manifested by fast sulfite disappearance and an increase in glutathione levels. The notion that SiR plays a role in the protection of plants against sulfite is supported by the rapid up-regulation of SiR transcript and activity within 30 min of sulfite injection into Arabidopsis and tomato leaves. Peroxisomal sulfite oxidase transcripts and activity levels are likewise promoted by sulfite application as compared with water injection controls. These results indicate that, in addition to participating in the sulfate assimilation reductive pathway, SiR also plays a role in protecting leaves against the toxicity of sulfite accumulation."
5312503	"In a double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter comparative trial in 127 evaluable patients with chronic, localized atopic dermatitis or lichen simplex chronicus, healing was reported in a higher percentage of patients treated with halobetasol propionate ointment than in those in the clobetasol propionate treatment group (65.1% versus 54.7%). The success rates (described as ""healed"" and ""marked improvement"") were practically identical in the two treatment groups (93.7% versus 92.2%). Early onset of therapeutic effect, that is, within 3 days of the start of treatment, was similar in the two treatment groups (24% versus 28%). Both preparations were well tolerated. Adverse effects were reported in 5% and 2% of the patients treated with halobetasol propionate and clobetasol propionate ointments, respectively."
6265054	"For most cutaneous basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas (nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSCs)), data are insufficient to permit evidence-based choices among treatments. To compare tumor recurrence after treatments, we conducted a prospective cohort study of consecutive patients with primary NMSCs treated with the most common treatments, in two practices in 1999-2000. Recurrence was determined from medical records by observers blinded to treatment type. Follow-up was available for 1,174 patients with 1,488 tumors (93.8%) at median 7.4 years; of these tumors, 24.3% (N=361) were treated with destruction with electrodessication/curettage, 38.3% (N=571) with excision, and 37.4% (N=556) with histologically guided serial excision (Mohs surgery). The overall 5-year tumor recurrence rate (95% confidence interval) was 3.3% (2.3, 4.4). Unadjusted recurrence rates did not differ after treatments: 4.9% (2.3, 7.4) after destruction, 3.5% (1.8, 5.2) after excision, and 2.1% (0.6, 3.5) after Mohs surgery (P=0.26), and no difference was seen after adjustment for risk factors. In tumors treated only with excision or Mohs surgery, the hazard of recurrence was not significantly different, even after adjustment for propensity for treatment with Mohs surgery. These data indicate that common treatments for NMSCs were at least 95% effective, and further studies are needed to guide therapeutic choices for different clinical subgroups."
2810547	"The standard technique for fistula cannulation, the rope-ladder technique, is problematic for patients with short fistula lengths and for patients in whom the fistula is difficult to cannulate. The buttonhole technique, cannulation of exactly the same site, offers the advantage of an easy cannulation procedure. However, it can be used only in native fistulas and cannulation is preferably executed by a 'single-sticker'. This study was conducted to compare these cannulation techniques using objective parameters.                                                                              We introduced the buttonhole technique for self-cannulating home haemodialysis patients and compared it with baseline data obtained with the rope-ladder technique. Thirty-three patients with a native arteriovenous fistula were observed prospectively during 18 months on the following parameters: cannulating ease, number of bad sticks, pain, time of compression after cannula removal, bleeding, infectious complications and aneurysm formation.                                                                              With the buttonhole method, cannulating ease improved distinctly, which was especially favourable in patients with a short fistula vein. Reported cannulation pain did not change significantly. The incidence of bad sticks decreased significantly, as well as time of compression after cannula removal, without increased incidence of bleeding. Three patients developed a local skin infection of their buttonhole during the study, after which the disinfection routine prior to cannulation was changed.                                                                                      Compared with the rope-ladder technique, the buttonhole method offers the advantage of an easier cannulation procedure with less bad sticks, which has a special benefit for patients with limited access cannulation sites or with a fistula which is difficult to cannulate. Prolonged compression times or re-bleeding episodes did not occur, but precautions have to be taken in order to prevent infectious complications. The buttonhole method can contribute considerably to the cannulating ease of self-cannulating patients, thus providing a better quality of life."
6903401	"Pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza virus (H1N1) infection is considered harmful to lung transplant recipients (LTRs). Vaccination against this virus is recommended for LTRs, but little is known about associated benefits and risks. Our aim in this study is to document the safety and clinical effectiveness of the H1N1 vaccine in LTRs.                                                                              All LTRs received an informational letter on the H1N1 pandemic that included hygiene and vaccination recommendations. After completing a questionnaire, volunteering LTRs received Pandemrix (H1N1 2009 Monovalent AS03-Adjuvanted Vaccine; GSK). Adverse events (AEs) were documented at short-term follow-up visits and by telephone. Any flu-like symptoms were reported and a low threshold for performing nasal/pharyngeal swabs for virus detection was maintained.                                                                              Of 168 eligible LTRs (107 already vaccinated for 2009 seasonal influenza), 148 (88%) received at least one vaccination with the H1N1 vaccine and 115 received a second dose. After the first vaccination, 44% had no AEs. Six self-limiting, severe AEs occurred, and the remainder were minor to moderate, predominantly injection-site reactions. After the second vaccination, AEs were clearly less frequent. All AEs resolved completely. Documented H1N1 infection occurred in 2 of 148 vaccinated LTRs, in contrast to 5 infections in 20 non-vaccinated LTRs.                                                                                      H1N1 vaccination is generally well tolerated with mild to moderate, predominantly local AEs in most LTRs and few self-limiting severe events. Clinical effectiveness is good."
5530878	"Xylans play an important role in plant cell wall integrity and have many industrial applications. Characterization of xylan synthase (XS) complexes responsible for the synthesis of these polymers is currently lacking. We recently purified XS activity from etiolated wheat (Triticum aestivum) seedlings. To further characterize this purified activity, we analyzed its protein composition and assembly. Proteomic analysis identified six main proteins: two glycosyltransferases (GTs) TaGT43-4 and TaGT47-13; two putative mutases (TaGT75-3 and TaGT75-4) and two non-GTs; a germin-like protein (TaGLP); and a vernalization related protein (TaVER2). Coexpression of TaGT43-4, TaGT47-13, TaGT75-3, and TaGT75-4 in Pichia pastoris confirmed that these proteins form a complex. Confocal microscopy showed that all these proteins interact in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) but the complexes accumulate in Golgi, and TaGT43-4 acts as a scaffold protein that holds the other proteins. Furthermore, ER export of the complexes is dependent of the interaction between TaGT43-4 and TaGT47-13. Immunogold electron microscopy data support the conclusion that complex assembly occurs at specific areas of the ER before export to the Golgi. A di-Arg motif and a long sequence motif within the transmembrane domains were found conserved at the NH2-terminal ends of TaGT43-4 and homologous proteins from diverse taxa. These conserved motifs may control the forward trafficking of the complexes and their accumulation in the Golgi. Our findings indicate that xylan synthesis in grasses may involve a new regulatory mechanism linking complex assembly with forward trafficking and provide new insights that advance our understanding of xylan biosynthesis and regulation in plants."
1574376	"Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome (CDS) is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder featuring congenital ichthyosis combined with pleiomorphic visceral manifestations associated with tissue accumulation of cytoplasmic lipid droplets. Mutations in the ABHD5 gene, encoding a crucial cofactor for adipose triglyceride lipase, have been found to underlie all CDS cases reported to date. The purposed of this study was to ascertain the genetic defect underlying CDS in a large multigenerational family. We used a combination of direct sequencing, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and microsatellite marker genotyping to identify a novel CDS-causing mutation in ABHD5. Although no pathogenic mutation could be identified in the coding sequence of the ABHD5 gene, polymorphic marker genotyping analysis supported linkage to this gene locus. Accordingly, direct sequencing of RT-PCR amplification products generated from patient skin-derived total RNA, revealed in all four patients the presence of a 101 bp insertion between exon 3 and exon 4. Bioinformatic analysis and direct sequencing indicated that this insertion resulted from an exceptional mutational event, namely, the insertion of a LINE element into intron 3 of the ABHD5 gene, leading to aberrant splicing out of the mutant intron 3. Our results confirm genetic homogeneity in CDS and underscore the importance of RNA studies in the molecular diagnosis of genodermatoses."
3206553	"Organisms with a high density of transposable elements (TEs) exhibit nesting, with subsequent repeats found inside previously inserted elements. Nesting splits the sequence structure of TEs and makes annotation of repetitive areas challenging. We present TEnest, a repeat identification and display tool made specifically for highly repetitive genomes. TEnest identifies repetitive sequences and reconstructs separated sections to provide full-length repeats and, for long-terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons, calculates age since insertion based on LTR divergence. TEnest provides a chronological insertion display to give an accurate visual representation of TE integration history showing timeline, location, and families of each TE identified, thus creating a framework from which evolutionary comparisons can be made among various regions of the genome. A database of repeats has been developed for maize (Zea mays), rice (Oryza sativa), wheat (Triticum aestivum), and barley (Hordeum vulgare) to illustrate the potential of TEnest software. All currently finished maize bacterial artificial chromosomes totaling 29.3 Mb were analyzed with TEnest to provide a characterization of the repeat insertions. Sixty-seven percent of the maize genome was found to be made up of TEs; of these, 95% are LTR retrotransposons. The rate of solo LTR formation is shown to be dissimilar across retrotransposon families. Phylogenetic analysis of TE families reveals specific events of extreme TE proliferation, which may explain the high quantities of certain TE families found throughout the maize genome. The TEnest software package is available for use on PlantGDB under the tools section (http://www.plantgdb.org/prj/TE_nest/TE_nest.html); the source code is available from (http://wiselab.org)."
1592322	"Intact alveolar epithelial Na(+)/K(+)- adenosinetriphosphatase (ATPase) function is important in preventing alveolar fluid accumulation after lung transplantation. We examined whether the type of preservation solution used influences Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity in alveolar epithelial cells.                                                                              Rat alveolar type II cells were preserved with EP4, low-potassium dextran (LPD), or Euro-Collins solution at 7 degrees C for 5 and 20 hours. To assess cell toxicity, we measured cell viability and lactate dehydrogenase release. Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity was measured as ouabain-sensitive ATPase hydrolysis. We also examined the effect of terbutaline (10(-3) mol/liter) and dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate (dbcAMP) (10(-3) mol/liter) on Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity in A549 cells preserved for 5 hours.                                                                              All solutions caused significant damage of rat alveolar type II cells at 20 hours. However, Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity was preserved at normal levels with EP4 and LPD over 20 hours. Terbutaline and dbcAMP significantly increased Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity in A549 cells preserved with EP4 and LPD solutions for 5 hours. However, we observed no activation in the cells preserved with Euro-Collins solution. We found no significant difference in intracellular cAMP levels after terbutaline challenge among the types of preservation solution.                                                                                      We conclude that extracellular-type solutions such as EP4 and LPD may be preferable for maintaining not only the basal activity but also the ability to activate Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase in response to beta-adrenergic agonists, in alveolar epithelial cells."
3309388	"Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized the pace and scale of genomics- and transcriptomics-based SNP discovery across different plant and animal species. Herein, 72-base paired-end Illumina sequencing was employed for high-throughput, parallel and large-scale SNP discovery in 41 growth-related candidate genes in Eucalyptus camaldulensis. Approximately 100 kb of genome from 96 individuals was amplified and sequenced using a hierarchical DNA/PCR pooling strategy and assembled over corresponding E. grandis reference. A total of 1191 SNPs (minimum 5% other allele frequency) were identified with an average frequency of 1 SNP/83.9 bp, whereas in exons and introns, it was 1 SNP/108.4 bp and 1 SNP/65.6 bp, respectively. A total of 75 insertions and 89 deletions were detected of which approximately 15% were exonic. Transitions (Tr) were in excess than transversions (Tv) (Tr/Tv: 1.89), but exceeded in exons (Tr/Tv: 2.73). In exons, synonymous SNPs (Ka) prevailed over the non-synonymous SNPs (Ks; average Ka/Ks ratio: 0.72, range: 0-3.00 across genes). Many of the exonic SNPs/indels had potential to change amino acid sequence of respective genes. Transcription factors appeared more conserved, whereas enzyme coding genes appeared under relaxed control. Further, 541 SNPs were classified into 196 'equal frequency' (EF) blocks with almost similar minor allele frequencies to facilitate selection of one tag-SNP/EF-block. There were 241 (approximately 20%) 'zero-SNP' blocks with absence of SNPs in surrounding ±60 bp windows. The data thus indicated enormous extant and unexplored diversity in E. camaldulensis in the studied genes with potential applications for marker-trait associations."
7943919	"We have previously described an ATPase Langerhans cell (LC) staining technique allowing progression from light to electron microscope observation. Using this technique we have studied, following epicutaneous application of a sensitizing dose of a hapten, 2,4-dinitro-1-fluorobenzene (DNFB), the fate of the epidermal LC located in the sensitization zone. We wanted to know, under the light microscope, if the density and/or morphology of the LC are modified by such a treatment and, under the electron microscope, what are the ultrastructural changes accompanying the possible light microscope modifications. Under the light microscope, the observation of LC during the 5 d necessary for the development of contact sensitivity to DNFB shows that their number drops in the course of the first 24 h to normalize again 3 d later. Under the electron microscope, observations over the first 24 h revealed that LC remained in the epidermis, but were ATPase-negative. The disappearance of the membrane ATPase activity took place while the LC presented an increased number of coated pits, coated vesicles, endosomes, and lysosome organelles which characterize, at the ultrastructural level, the process of receptor-mediated endocytosis (RME). Following RME, many Birbeck granules (BG) appeared in the cytoplasm. Thus, epicutaneous application of DNFB leads to an endocytic activation of LC. However, the ligand(s) and/or the cell-surface components, which probably internalize during the RME process, remain unknown."
4633241	"Scleroderma is a fibrotic disorder of unknown etiology that is characterized by excessive collagen synthesis and its deposition in the skin and various internal organs.                                                                                  To examine whether an overproduction of extracellular matrix molecules is a result of either increased fibroblast proliferation or increased collagen synthesis. As results of clinical trials with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) have suggested beneficial effect in the treatment of scleroderma patients, the effects of calcitriol on fibroblasts derived from scleroderma and normal skin has been examined as well.                                                                              Cultures of fibroblasts were established from biopsies from involved and uninvolved skin of scleroderma patients and from skin of healthy subjects, and compared with respect to proliferation, collagen synthesis and collagen lattice contraction.                                                                              No significant differences in cell proliferation and in the extent of fibroblast-induced collagen lattice contraction have been found between scleroderma patients exhibited a disorganized growth pattern in a monolayer culture in contrast to normal fibroblasts. Collagen synthesis tends to be higher in scleroderma fibroblasts as compared with controls. Calcitriol exerted an antiproliferative and antisynthetic effect on fibroblasts, which, however, did not discriminate healthy fibroblasts from fibroblasts derived from involved or uninvolved scleroderma plaques.                                                                                      Our findings suggest that collagen accumulation may not result from increased proliferation or altered dynamic properties of fibroblasts in a scleroderma lesion but from increased collagen biosynthesis. We additionally found that calcitriol does not selectively affect scleroderma fibroblasts."
5466008	"Six cases of poor sequential bilateral cochlear implant use (partial and complete non-use) were explored through a semi-structured interview, as part of a service evaluation and development audit to improve the quality of a paediatric implant service for sequential users. Themes associated with poor use include: (1) appearance issues, (2) unrealistic expectations of both the benefits and the challenges of adjustment, (3) poor personal motivation for the implant and for engagement in rehabilitation, and (4) dislike of the sound. Feedback from young people highlighted the importance of careful counselling about their expectations of sequential implantation, outcomes and challenges, systemic support and self-directed rehabilitation."
5811008	"A 28-year-old Asian male was referred for dermatologic evaluation of diffuse bluish-red maculopapules in the lower trunk and genital regions. There was no family history, and with the exception of dispersed skin lesions and hypohidrosis, no other complaints or symptoms were present. Histological evaluation of the skin lesions revealed angiokeratomas. When this combination of clinical and histological findings is observed, Fabry disease is suspected. Biochemical examination performed for definitive diagnosis did not show any activity of the α-galactosidase A enzyme. Through identification of a c.182_183ins(GA) mutation of the GLA gene, Fabry disease was diagnosed. However, there was no particular abnormal finding with regard to the evaluation of non-cutaneous manifestations, a symptom that can occur in the progress of this disease. We reported a case of Fabry disease, restricted to the dermatologic presentation, involving a novel frameshift mutation in the GLA gene."
4318695	"Eosinophilic fasciitis, originally reported as a syndrome distinct from scleroderma, appears now to be an early inflammatory variant of scleroderma. No less than one half of the cases reported as eosinophilic fasciitis have convincing features of scleroderma, including Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal dysmotility, restrictive lung disease, diffuse hyperpigmentation, synovitis, flexion contractures, dermal sclerosis, colonic diverticula, scleroderma kidney, positive latex fixation test, and the presence of serum antinuclear antibodies (ANA). Clinical presentations of scleroderma range from isolated acrosclerosis to rapidly progressive systemic sclerosis. As clinical experience and long-term follow-up data on eosinophilic fasciitis accumulate, it appears that the syndrome may well represent another variant in the scleroderma spectrum. Reported here is a case which presented clinically and histologically as eosinophilic fasciitis, but which progressed over 3 years to diffuse, histologically confirmed scleroderma."
5585564	"Type VII collagen is the major component of anchoring fibrils, adhesion structures of stratified epithelia that span the basement membrane region and papillary dermis. Mutations in the gene COL7A1 encoding type VII collagen cause dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, a clinically heterogeneous autosomal dominant or recessive blistering disorder of the skin and mucous membranes. In this report, we investigate three siblings affected by an unusually mild form of localized recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa who were shown to be compound heterozygotes for novel mutations affecting COL7A1. The maternally inherited mutation is a G-->   C transversion that converts a codon for glycine to a codon for arginine (G1347R). The paternal mutation is a neutral G-->   A transition at the last base of exon 70(5820G-->   A) that alters the correct splicing of COL7A1 pre-mRNA, giving rise to an aberrant mRNA carrying the in-frame skipping of exon 70 in addition to the full-length RNA transcript carrying the G-->   A substitution. Consistent with the normal levels of COL7A1 mRNA transcripts detected by northern analysis, immunoblotting and immunofluorescence studies evidenced that the patient keratinocytes synthesize and secrete normal amounts of stable type VII collagen, which is correctly deposited at the dermal-epidermal junction. In addition, mutated type VII collagen molecules assemble to form numerous, normally shaped anchoring fibrils, as shown by electron microscopic examination. The combination of a recessive glycine substitution with a splice site mutation that permits partially correct splicing therefore leads to a normal expression of mutated type VII collagen molecules with marginally altered biologic activity, and to the extremely mild phenotype observed in our patients."

In two prospective, open-label, controlled, randomized, crossover pilot studies, 39 prevalent hemodialysis (HD) patients were studied in four dialysis treatments as follows: study 1, three MCO prototype dialyzers (AA, BB and CC with increasing permeability) and one high-flux dialyzer in HD; and study 2, two MCO prototype dialyzers (AA and BB) in HD and high-flux dialyzers in HD and hemodiafiltration (HDF). Primary outcome was lambda free light chain (λFLC) overall clearance. Secondary outcomes included overall clearances and pre-to-post-reduction ratios of middle and small molecules, and safety of MCO HD treatments.                                                                              MCO HD provided greater λFLC overall clearance [least square mean (standard error)] as follows: study 1: MCO AA 8.5 (0.54), MCO BB 11.3 (0.51), MCO CC 15.0 (0.53) versus high-flux HD 3.6 (0.51) mL/min; study 2: MCO AA 10.0 (0.58), MCO BB 12.5 (0.57) versus high-flux HD 4.4 (0.57) and HDF 6.2 (0.58) mL/min. Differences between MCO and high-flux dialyzers were consistently significant in mixed model analysis (each P <    0.001). Reduction ratios of λFLC were greater for MCO. Clearances of α1-microglobulin, complement factor D, kappa FLC (κFLC) and myoglobin were generally greater with MCO than with high-flux HD and similar to or greater than clearances with HDF. Albumin loss was moderate with MCO, but greater than with high-flux HD and HDF.                                                                                      MCO HD removes a wide range of middle molecules more effectively than high-flux HD and even exceeds the performance of high-volume HDF for large solutes, particularly λFLC."

9784592	"Taxodium is renowned for its strong tolerance to waterlogging stress, thus it has great ecological and economic potential. However, the scant genomic resources in genus Taxodium have greatly hindered further exploration of its underlying flood-tolerance mechanism. Taxodium 'Zhongshansa' is an interspecies hybrid of T. distichum and T. mucronatum, and has been widely planted in southeastern China. To understand the genetic basis of its flood tolerance, we analyzed the transcriptomes of Taxodium 'Zhongshansa' roots and shoots in response to short-term waterlogging.                                                                              RNA-seq was used to analyze genome-wide transcriptome changes of Taxodium 'Zhongshansa 406' clone root and shoot treated with 1 h of soil-waterlogging stress. After de novo assembly, 108,692 unigenes were achieved, and 70,260 (64.64%) of them were annotated. There were 2090 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) found in roots and 394 in shoots, with 174 shared by both of them, indicating that the aerial parts were also affected. Under waterlogging stress, the primary reaction of hypoxic-treated root was to activate the antioxidative defense system to prevent cells experiencing reactive oxygen species (ROS) poisoning. As respiration was inhibited and ATP decreased, another quick coping mechanism was repressing the energy-consuming biosynthetic processes through the whole plant. The glycolysis and fermentation pathway was activated to maintain ATP production in the hypoxic root. Constantly, the demand for carbohydrates increased, and carbohydrate metabolism were accumulated in the root as well as the shoot, possibly indicating that systemic communications between waterlogged and non-waterlogged tissues facilated survival. Amino acid metabolism was also greatly influenced, with down-regulation of genes involvedin serine degradation and up-regulation of aspartic acid degradation. Additionally, a non-symbiotic hemoglobin class 1 gene was up-regulated, which may also help the ATP production. Moreover, the gene expression pattern of 5 unigenes involving in the glycolysis pathway revealed by qRT-PCR confirmed the RNA-Seq data.                                                                                      We conclude that ROS detoxification and energy maintenance were the primary coping mechanisms of 'Zhongshansa' in surviving oxygen deficiency, which may be responsible for its remarkable waterlogging tolerance. Our study not only provided the first large-scale assessment of genomic resources of Taxodium but also guidelines for probing the molecular mechanism underlying 'Zhongshansa' waterlogging tolerance."

2145115	"This review presents the clinical, dermato-histopathological and genetic features of canine X-linked ectodermal dysplasia in previously reported cases and in three new spontaneous cases. The condition is compared with anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia in humans and, based on current genetic concepts, we suggest that the two conditions are caused by the same gene and, consequently, represent a single pathological entity that affects both humans and dogs."
9967516	"Eight pathotypes of Plasmopara halstedii were screened to investigate the occurrence of virions and the potential viral influence on the pathogenicity of the sunflower downy mildew pathogen. In 23 of 26 P. halstedii isolates derived from eight countries in Europe, North America and South America, virions were detected by transmission electron microscopy. By contrast, there were no ultrastructural indications of virus-like particles in eight other related Oomycetes. The virions of representative P. halstedii isolates were morphologically and biochemically characterized and compared among each other. Regardless of their host's pathotypes, the geographical origin of the isolate and the sensitivity towards the fungicide metalaxyl, the viral characters obtained were uniform. The virions were isometric and measured approximately 37 nm in diameter. One polypeptide of c. 36 kDa and two segments of single-stranded RNA (3.0 and 1.6 kb) were detected. Both viral RNA segments were detected by capillary electrophoresis in the three remaining P. halstedii isolates where virions were undetectable by transmission electron microscopy. Virus-specific primers for the 1.6 kb-segment were synthesized and used to determine and compare a partial sequence of the viral coat protein among virions of different P. halstedii pathotypes. In all tested isolates, fragments of 0.7 kb were amplified which were directly sequenced. Sequence variation was insignificant. As both less aggressive and more aggressive P. halstedii isolates contained virions, the presence or absence of virions could not explain the diverse aggressiveness of the downy mildew pathogen towards sunflower. Moreover, the results indicated that pathogenicity of P. halstedii was not related to variation in morphological or biochemical characters of the virions."
5073884	"Polyphagous aphid pests cause considerable economic damage to crop plants, primarily through the depletion of photoassimilates and transfer of viruses. The potato aphid (Macrosiphum euphorbiae) is a notable pest of solanaceous crops, however, the molecular mechanisms that underpin the ability to colonize these hosts are unknown. It has recently been demonstrated that like other aphid species, M. euphorbiae injects a battery of salivary proteins into host plants during feeding. It is speculated that these proteins function in a manner analagous to secreted effectors from phytopathogenic bacteria, fungi and oomycetes. Here, we describe a novel aphid effector (Me47) which was identified from the potato aphid salivary secretome as a putative glutathione-S-transferase (GST). Expression of Me47 in Nicotiana benthamiana enhanced reproductive performance of green peach aphid (Myzus persicae). Similarly, delivery of Me47 into leaves of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) by Pseudomonas spp. enhanced potato aphid fecundity. In contrast, delivery of Me47 into Arabidopsis thaliana reduced GPA reproductive performance, indicating that Me47 impacts the outcome of plant-aphid interactions differently depending on the host species. Delivery of Me47 by the non-pathogenic Pseudomonas fluorescens revealed that Me47 protein or activity triggers defense gene transcriptional upregulation in tomato but not Arabidopsis. Recombinant Me47 was purified and demonstrated to have GST activity against two specific isothiocyanates (ITCs), compounds implicated in herbivore defense. Whilst GSTs have previously been associated with development of aphid resistance to synthetic insecticides, the findings described here highlight a novel function as both an elicitor and suppressor of plant defense when delivered into host tissues."
3268027	"We have sought to identify pistil-specific genes that can be used as molecular markers to study pistil development. For this purpose, a cDNA library was constructed from poly(A)+ RNA extracted from tobacco stigmas and styles at different developmental stages. Differential screening of this library led to the isolation of cDNA clones that correspond to genes preferentially or specifically expressed in the pistil. Seven of these cDNA clones encode proteins containing repetitions of the pentapeptide Ser-Pro4, which is a typical motif found in extensins. Unlike extensin genes, the extensin-like genes described here are not induced under stress conditions. RNA gel blot hybridizations demonstrated the organ-specific expression of the extensin-like genes and their temporal regulation during pistil development. After pollination, the transcript levels of the pistil-specific extensin-like genes change relative to levels in unpollinated pistils. In situ hybridization experiments showed that at least one of these pistil-specific genes is specifically expressed in cells of the transmitting tissue. The possible roles of the extensin-like proteins in pistils are discussed."
7186951	"Pili multigemini is a rare developmental defect of hair follicles. It usually involves the beard of an adult and the scalp in children, but there have been no reported cases on the back. We report 3 cases of extensive pili multigemini over the entire back of healthy males. All cases were found incidentally. The direct microscopic examination of one hair follicle showed that it consisted of more than twenty shafts, which had rough surfaces and brush-like bulbs. The histological examination revealed that complicated follicular structures formed as many as 23 to even 36 hair shafts. Lots of hairs were surrounded by each inner root sheath and had one common outer root sheath. We suggest this nevoid is pili multigemini over the back."
6995608	"A reliable screening test for coronary artery disease (CAD) in liver transplant (LT) candidates with end-stage liver disease is essential because a high percentage of perioperative mortality and morbidity is CAD-related. In this study, the effectiveness of myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) for identification of significant CAD in LT candidates was evaluated. Records of 244 patients meeting criteria for MPI were evaluated: 74 met inclusion criteria; 40 had a positive MPI and cardiology follow-up; 27 had a negative MPI and underwent LT; and seven had a negative MPI and then had coronary angiography or a significant cardiac event. A selective MPI interpretation strategy was established where MPI-positive patients were divided into high, intermediate, and low CAD risk groups. The overall incidence of CAD in this study population was 5.1% and our strategy resulted in PPV 20%, NPV 94%, sensitivity 80%, and specificity 50% for categorizing CAD risk. When applied only to the subset of patients categorized as high CAD risk, the strategy was more effective, with PPV 67%, NPV 97%, sensitivity 80%, and specificity 94%. We determined that renal dysfunction was an independent predictive factor for CAD (p <    0.0001, odds ratio = 8.1), and grades of coronary occlusion correlated significantly with chronic renal dysfunction (p = 0.0079)."
7962002	"The root extract of Pulsatilla koreana (Ranunculaceae) has been found to have prominent abilities to reverse scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment in rats, and to increase the viability of human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells incubated with amyloid-beta peptide (1 - 42) [A beta (1 - 42)]. In vivo and in vitro activity-guided fractionation studies using solvent-partitioning and subsequent chromatographic separations led to the isolation of hederacolchiside-E, an oleanolic glycoside, as an active ingredient. Administration of hederacolchiside-E (30 and 60 mg/kg body weight, P. O.) increased the step-through latency time in the passive avoidance test as efficiently as tacrine (30 mg/kg, P. O.). The neuroprotective effect of hederacolchiside-E on SK-N-SH cells against the toxicity of A beta (1 - 42) was comparable to that of catechin. These data suggest that hederacolchiside-E might be a good therapeutic candidate for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease."

4585819	"Evaluation of urine cytology (UC) for decoy cells and quantitative determinations of viruria (urine viral load [UPCR])and viremia (viral load in blood [VLB]) have been proposed as surrogate markers of polyomavirus allograft nephropathy (PVAN). In this study, we present the experience with the concurrent evaluation of UC, UPCR, and VLB in 349 patients (940 sets of samples). Results were correlated with each other and with a previous, concurrent, or subsequent biopsy diagnosis of PVAN. Patients were followed up for a mean of 27 months posttransplantation. We conclude that both UC and UPCR are useful for screening of renal transplant recipients. Simultaneous performance of both UC and UPCR does not add useful clinical information. In patients with positive UC, performance of UPCR, however, can allow for the distinction between BK and JC polyoma viruses. Quantitative measurement of viremia is not indicated in patients lacking viruria because no patients with PVAN present with this combination of findings. In patients with viruria, a positive viremia strongly correlates with PVAN. Rationale selection of screening protocols based on the current knowledge of the infection and tailored to the available laboratory capabilities in each transplantation center can optimize the use of resources."
1765952	"Plants require sophisticated regulatory mechanisms to ensure the degree of anthocyanin pigmentation is appropriate to myriad developmental and environmental signals. Central to this process are the activity of MYB-bHLH-WD repeat (MBW) complexes that regulate the transcription of anthocyanin genes. In this study, the gene regulatory network that regulates anthocyanin synthesis in petunia (Petunia hybrida) has been characterized. Genetic and molecular evidence show that the R2R3-MYB, MYB27, is an anthocyanin repressor that functions as part of the MBW complex and represses transcription through its C-terminal EAR motif. MYB27 targets both the anthocyanin pathway genes and basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) ANTHOCYANIN1 (AN1), itself an essential component of the MBW activation complex for pigmentation. Other features of the regulatory network identified include inhibition of AN1 activity by the competitive R3-MYB repressor MYBx and the activation of AN1, MYB27, and MYBx by the MBW activation complex, providing for both reinforcement and feedback regulation. We also demonstrate the intercellular movement of the WDR protein (AN11) and R3-repressor (MYBx), which may facilitate anthocyanin pigment pattern formation. The fundamental features of this regulatory network in the Asterid model of petunia are similar to those in the Rosid model of Arabidopsis thaliana and are thus likely to be widespread in the Eudicots."

Advances in laser technology have led to an expansion in the number of devices available, with as a consequence an increase in the total number of complications. Fortunately, the current technology has improved greatly which adds to the safety profile of such devices; nevertheless, thorough knowledge of laser complications and how to avoid them is paramount for any practitioner who uses such technology."
9483136	"Ex vivo production of interleukin 10 (IL-10) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) was investigated in patients with (n = 5) or without (n = 5) chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) after allogeneic BMT. Patients were matched for time after transplantation and type of transplant. Anti-CD3-induced IL-10 production in MNCs isolated from patients with cGVHD (range/median: 26-650 pg/10(6) MNC; 400 pg/10(6) MNC) was significantly reduced compared to patients without cGVHD (646-2662 pg/10(6) MNC; 1314 pg/10(6) MNC; P <    0.05) or healthy controls (679-6361 pg/10(6) MNC; 3054 pg/10(6) MNC, P <    0.01). In vitro inhibition of IL-10 by an anti-IL-10 monoclonal antibody enhanced the release of IFN-gamma by anti-CD3-stimulated MNCs from 354 +/- 34 pg/10(6) MNCs to 899 +/- 61 pg/10(6) MNCs. Thus, low IL-10 production may cause high IFN-gamma release. In anti-CD3-activated MNCs obtained from patients with cGVHD IFN-gamma production was significantly increased (324-3331 pg/10(6) MNC; 1849 pg/10(6) MNC) compared to healthy donors (127-900 pg/10(6) MNC; 305 pg/10(6) MNC P <    0.01). In addition, median IFN-gamma release by anti-CD3-activated MNCs obtained from patients without cGVHD (464 pg/10(6) MNC) was about five-fold lower than in patients with cGVHD. In contrast to cytokine production, the differential leukocyte count (percentages of monocytes, T cells and CD4/CD8 ratio) was essentially the same both in patients with or without cGVHD. Thus, a different activation of Th-1 and Th-2 cells by anti-CD3 may be responsible for the deviant cytokine productions in patients with cGVHD. In conclusion, we observed significantly decreased IL-10 production in patinets with cGVHD and an increased median IFN-gamma secretion, which may contribute to the altered cytokine production after allogeneic BMT leading to cGVHD. Thus, supplementing IL-10 may become a new strategy for preventing cGVHD."
6103941	"Onychomycosis is usually caused by dermatophytes, but some species of nondermatophytic molds and yeasts are also associated with nail invasion. Aspergillus niger is a nondermatophytic mold which exists as an opportunistic filamentous fungus in all environments. Here, we report a case of onychomycosis caused by A. niger in a 66-year-old female. The patient presented with a black discoloration and a milky white base and onycholysis on the proximal portion of the right thumb nail. Direct microscopic examination of scrapings after potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation revealed dichotomous septate hyphae. Repeated cultures on Sabouraud's dextrose agar (SDA) without cycloheximide produced the same black velvety colonies. No colony growth occurred on SDA with cycloheximide slants. Biseriate phialides covering the entire vesicle with radiate conidial heads were observed on the slide culture. The DNA sequence of the internal transcribed spacer region of the clinical sample was a 100% match to that of A. niger strain ATCC 16888 (GenBank accession number AY373852). A. niger was confirmed by KOH mount, colony identification, light microscopic morphology, and DNA sequence analysis. The patient was treated orally with 250 mg terbinafine daily and topical amorolfine 5% nail lacquer for 3 months. As a result, the patient was completely cured clinically and mycologically."
4738051	"A cDNA clone (bra) encoding a small GTP-binding protein was isolated from Brassica napus by screening a root cDNA library with a degenerate oligonucleotide probe that corresponds to a highly conserved GTP-binding domain of the Ras superfamily. Sequence analysis shows that the clone contains an open reading frame of 219 amino acid residues with the estimated molecular mass of 24379 Da and this coding region contains all the conserved motifs of the Ras superfamily. The deduced amino acid sequence of the bra gene is most closely related to the Ypt/Rab family that functions in the vesicular transport (46% and 47% amino acid identity to the yeast Ypt1 and to the human Rab1, respectively) and is more distantly related to the other Ras-related families. The protein encoded by the bra gene, when expressed in Escherichia coli, shows the ability to bind GTP. Furthermore, when the bra gene is introduced into Saccharomyces cerevisiae under the regulation of the yeast GAL1 promoter, the gene can complement the temperature-sensitive yeast mutation ypt1-1 that has defects in vesicular transport function. The amino acid sequence similarity and the functional complementation of the yeast mutation suggest that this gene is likely to be involved in the vesicular transport in plants. Genomic Southern analysis shows that this gene is a member of a small gene family in Brassica napus."
4973600	"Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA) can be differentiated from other subepidermal bullous diseases by sophisticated techniques such as immunoelectron microscopy, salt-split skin antigen mapping, fluorescence overlay antigen mapping, immunoblot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.                                                                                   To determine whether the diagnosis can also be made by routine direct immunofluorescence microscopy.                                                                              We studied frozen skin biopsies from 157 patients with various subepidermal immunobullous diseases.                                                                              We found three distinct 'linear' fluorescence patterns at the basement membrane zone: true linear, n-serrated and u-serrated. The true linear pattern, often seen in conjunction with either the n- or the u-serrated pattern, was found in any subepidermal immunobullous disease with nongranular depositions. In bullous pemphigoid, mucous membrane pemphigoid, antiepiligrin cicatricial pemphigoid, p200 pemphigoid and linear IgA disease the n-serrated pattern was found, corresponding with depositions located in hemidesmosomes, lamina lucida or lamina densa. However, in EBA and bullous systemic lupus erythematosus the u-serrated staining pattern was seen, corresponding with the ultralocalization of type VII collagen in the sublamina densa zone. The diagnosis of EBA with IgG or IgA autoantibodies directed against type VII collagen was confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy, salt-split skin antigen mapping, fluorescence overlay antigen mapping or immunoblotting.                                                                                      Using this pattern recognition by direct immunofluorescence microscopy we discovered several cases of EBA which would otherwise have been erroneously diagnosed as a form of pemphigoid or linear IgA disease."
4680959	"We investigated the role of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS), which allows proteins to be selectively degraded, during gametophyte development in Arabidopsis thaliana. Three mutant alleles altering the UPS were isolated in the Wassilewskija (Ws) accession: they affect the Regulatory Particle 5a (RPT5a) gene, which (along with RPT5b) encodes one of the six AAA-ATPases of the proteasome regulatory particle. In the heterozygous state, all three mutant alleles displayed 50% pollen lethality, suggesting that RPT5a is essential for male gametophyte development. However, a fourth mutant in the Columbia (Col) accession did not display such a phenotype because the RPT5b Col allele complements the rpt5a defect in the male gametophyte, whereas the RPT5b Ws allele does not. Double rpt5a rpt5b mutants showed a complete male and female gametophyte lethal phenotype in a Col background, indicating that RPT5 subunits are essential for both gametophytic phases. Mitotic divisions were affected in double mutant gametophytes correlating with an absence of the proteasome-dependent cyclinA3 degradation. Finally, we show that RPT5b expression is highly increased when proteasome functioning is defective, allowing complementation of the rpt5a mutation. In conclusion, RPT5 subunits are not only essential for both male and female gametophyte development but also display accession-dependent redundancy and are crucial in cell cycle progression."
4282274	"The aim of this study was to perform a histomorphometric and biomechanical comparison of three implants with different designs of the apical area to promote a better bone initial stability and its correlation with the osseointegration.                                                                                           Fifty-four tapered implants with same length, diameter and surface properties but with three different apical configurations (Group I: MK4: Group II: C1 and Group III: MK7) were inserted in the tibia of rabbits. Implant stability and bone formation were evaluated by resonance frequency analysis measured at 0, 6, 8 and 12 weeks and by histomorphometric analysis performed at 6, 8 and 12 weeks.                                                                              Statistical test to compare the stability through the implant stability quotient in the four times showed few differences between the groups and time periods proposed, with significance set at P <    0.05. In the bone-implant contact, by comparing the groups in the three times proposed, it was possible concluded that there is a similar behavior among the three implant design (P <    0.05).                                                                                     With the limitations of this animal study, it can be concluded that the design of the apical area influences the implant stability and the bone-to-implant contact."
8391021	"The waiting list for cadaver kidney transplantation continues to grow. Yet there has been little increase in the number of living-donor transplants. At many centers, willing relatives are turned down as potential donors because of poor HLA ABDR matching with the recipient. It has been our policy to accept the 0-haplotype-match (0-HTM) living-related donor. We studied long-term (6-year) outcome of 0-HTM transplants compared with the outcome of transplants from 1- and 2-HTM recipients and from cadaver donors. Since 1984, 352 adults have received primary living-related renal transplants, and had a minimum of 1 year of follow-up: 92 2-HTM, 216 1-HTM, and 44 0-HTM. In the same period and with the same follow-up, 362 adults have received primary cadaver (CAD) renal transplants. Immunosuppression consisted of cyclosporine, azathioprine, and prednisone (triple therapy) for living-donor and sequential therapy for CAD recipients. ABDR match (mean +/- SD) for 0 HTM was 1.3 +/- 8; CAD, 2.0 +/- 1.6; % peak panel-reactive antibodies (PRA) for 0 HTM was 1.2 +/- 5.3; 1 HTM, 6.7 +/- 20; 2 HTM, 7.5 +/- 21; CAD, 15.5 +/- 30. The percentage of PRA at the time of transplant for 0 HTM was .7 +/- 4.4; 1 HTM, 4.1 +/- 1.6; 2 HTM, 6 +/- 18; CAD, 7.2 +/- 20. While the number of ABDR matches was significantly fewer for 0 HTM than for the other groups, the % PRA at transplant and the peak % PRA were less in the 0-HTM group. Other demographics were not significantly different. Patient survival was significantly lower in the CAD group vs. 2-HTM recipients (P <    .05). The living-related grafts had significantly greater survival than the CAD grafts (P <    .05), but there was no significant difference between 0-, 1-, and 2-HTM graft survival. The most common causes of graft loss in all groups were death and chronic rejection. In our experience, the long-term graft survivals of 0-HTM and 1-HTM transplants are the same, and both are superior to CAD results, using 0-HTM living-related donor transplants should be continued and encouraged."
1738193	"The cutaneous wound-healing process can lead to hypertrophic scar formation, during which exaggerated inflammation has been demonstrated to have an important role. Therefore, an exploration of strategies designed to regulate this inflammatory process is warranted. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have recently been demonstrated to regulate inflammation in various diseases. In this regard, using a rabbit model, we locally injected human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) derived from bone marrow to treat hypertrophic scar formation, and explored their underlying mechanisms. We found that hMSC therapy efficiently regulated inflammation and prevented scar formation. We attributed the therapeutic effects of hMSCs to their secretion of an anti-inflammatory protein, TNF-alpha-stimulated gene/protein 6 (TSG-6). Unexpectedly, after injection, the number of surviving hMSCs decreased markedly and the hMSCs underwent extensive apoptosis, which was demonstrated to promote their secretion of TSG-6, partially through the activation of caspase-3. Moreover, H2O2-induced apoptotic hMSCs showed higher inflammatory regulatory abilities. The inhibition of caspase-3 decreased the inflammatory regulatory abilities of hMSCs and attenuated their therapeutic effects. Our results demonstrate that hMSCs can efficiently prevent hypertrophic scar formation via inflammatory regulation. In addition, we found that apoptosis has an important role in the activation of the inflammatory regulatory abilities of hMSCs."
1393125	"Autumn leaf senescence is a spectacular natural phenomenon; however, the regulation networks controlling autumnal colors and the leaf senescence program remain largely unelucidated. Whether regulation of leaf senescence is similar in subtropical deciduous plants and temperate deciduous plants is also unknown. In this study, the gene expression of a subtropical deciduous tree, Formosan gum (Liquidambar formosana Hance), was profiled. The transcriptomes of April leaves (green leaves, 'G') and December leaves (red leaves, 'R') were investigated by next-generation gene sequencing. Out of 58,402 de novo assembled contigs, 32,637 were annotated as putative genes. Furthermore, the L. formosana-specific microarray designed based on total contigs was used to extend the observation period throughout the growing seasons of 2011-2013. Network analysis from the gene expression profile focused on the genes up-regulated when autumn leaf senescence occurred. LfWRKY70, LfWRKY75, LfWRKY65, LfNAC1, LfSPL14, LfNAC100 and LfMYB113 were shown to be key regulators of leaf senescnece, and the genes regulated by LfWRKY75, LfNAC1 and LfMYB113 are candidates to link chlorophyll degradation and anthocyanin biosynthesis to senescence. In summary, the gene expression profiles over the entire year of the developing leaf from subtropical deciduous trees were used for in silico analysis and the putative gene regulation in autumn coloration and leaf senescence is discussed in this study."
3844005	"Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions provide the highest level of evidence about efficacy but their value either alone or within a meta-analysis is dependent on its methodological quality. For this reason recent RCTs in organ transplantation were assessed for quality. RCTs published between 2004 and 2006 (n = 332) were assessed, after excluding duplicate and nonEnglish reports. Quality was evaluated using the Jadad score plus allocation concealment and intention to treat analysis. We noted journal type, journal author instructions, funding source, sample size and number and location of study centres. Around one-third of RCTs had a Jadad score of 3 or greater (indication of a methodologically good quality trial) and the other two parameters were satisfied in just over one third. Although the majority of trials were published in speciality journals the quality of those published in general journals was superior. Commercially sponsored trials were of better quality as were multicentre trials in contrast to single centre trials. Overall quality of reporting of RCTs in organ transplantation is poor and as RCTs provide the highest level of evidence in evaluations of interventions there needs to be a concerted effort within the transplant community to improve the standards of RCTs."
3927052	"Endothelial-like progenitor cells circulate in the peripheral blood (PB) and can be enumerated using cell culture-based progenitor assays. These circulating vascular progenitor cells (VPCs) are implicated in new vessel formation and regenerative potential in several animal and human models of tissue injury. Given the emerging role of VPCs in regenerative processes and the limited information on the availability of such progenitor cells, we sought to determine baseline circulating VPC levels in healthy allogeneic donors and autologous hematopoietic transplant patients. VPC numbers were also measured in peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) grafts from both graft types. Immunohistochemistry revealed that VPC clusters obtained under our culture conditions were CD45(+) and acquired endothelial features (CD31 and vascular endothelial-cadherin) in vitro upon angiogenic stimulation and gradually lost monocytic surface markers (CD14). Before PBSC mobilization, VPCs levels varied substantially in healthy donors and were markedly lower in patients with hematologic malignancies compared with healthy allogeneic donors with 27 +/- 15 versus 99 +/- 21 VPCs/mL (mean +/- SEM), respectively (P = .001). In patients undergoing stem cell mobilization, VPCs in the PB increased from 7 +/- 2 on day 0 to 51 +/- 9 by day 7 of mobilization (P = .05), representing a median fold increase of 8.9 (range, 3.0-29.8). Although autologous transplant patients underwent more intensive mobilization, VPCs were higher in allogeneic (7.2 +/- 1.4 x 10(3)/kg) than in autologous (2.6 +/- 1.5 x 10(3)/kg) mobilized PB grafts (P = .045). To identify predictors of VPC content, graft VPCs were compared with levels of CD34(+) cells, total colony forming unit (CFU), or granulocyte-macrophage colony forming unit (GM-CFU). None of these hematopoietic progenitors correlated with VPC numbers in PBSC grafts (P = NS). However, PB monocyte levels were highly correlated with circulating VPC levels (r = 0.71, P <    .0001). Thus, our analysis identified significant variability in VPCs at baseline and in PBSC grafts from healthy donors. Nevertheless, these donors remain a better source of VPCs than do autologous transplant patients. Importantly, VPC mobilization occurs independently of hematopoietic mobilization. In view of the potential role of VPCs in recovery from transplant-related tissue injury, angiogenic mobilization strategies that complement hematopoietic mobilization will need to be specifically designed."
1697136	"Plasmodesmata are highly specialized gatable trans-wall channels that interconnect contiguous cells and function in direct cytoplasm-to-cytoplasm intercellular transport. Computer-enhanced digital imaging analysis of electron micrographs of plasmodesmata has provided new information on plasmodesmatal fine structure. It is now becoming clear that plasmodesmata are dynamic quasi-organelles whose conductivity can be regulated by environmental and developmental signals. New findings suggest that signalling mechanisms exist which allow the plasmodesmatal pore to dilate to allow macromolecular transport. Plant viruses spread from cell to cell via plasmodesmata. Two distinct movement mechanisms have been elucidated. One movement mechanism involves the movement of the complete virus particle along virus-induced tubular structures within a modified plasmodesma. Apparently two virus-coded movement proteins are involved. A second movement mechanism involves the movement of a non-virion form through existing plasmodesmata. In this mechanism, the viral movement protein causes a rapid dilation of existing plasmodesmata to facilitate protein and nucleic acid movement. Techniques for the isolation of plasmodesmata have been developed and information on plasmodesma-associated proteins is now becoming available. New evidence is reviewed which suggests that plasmodesmatal composition and regulation may differ in different cells and tissues."
9399302	"Novel strategies for the treatment of congestive heart failure have taken the form of gene and cell therapy to induce angiogenesis, optimize calcium handling by cardiac myocytes, or regenerate damaged myocardial tissue. Arguably both gene- and cell-based therapies would be benefited by having the ability to locally deliver specific transcription factors and other usually nonsecreted proteins to cells in the surrounding myocardial tissue. The herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) tegument protein VP22 has been shown to mediate protein intercellular trafficking to mammalian cells and finally localize into the nucleus, which makes it a useful cargo-carrying functional protein in cell-based gene therapy. While VP22 has been studied as a means to modulate tumor growth, little is known about the distribution and transport kinetics of VP22 in the heart and its potential application in combination with autologous cell transplantation for the delivery of proteins to myocardial tissue. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of VP22 fusion protein intercellular trafficking combined with autologous cell transplantation in the heart. In an in vitro study untransfected rat heart cells were cocultured with stably transfected rat cardiac fibroblasts (RCF) with fusion constructs of VP22. The control experiment was untransfected rat heart cells co-plated with RCF stably transfected with enhanced green fluorescence protein (eGFP). The Lewis rat model was selected for in vivo study. In the in vitro studies there was a 14-fold increase in the number of GFP-positive cells 48 h after initiating coculture with VP22-eGFP RCF compared to eGFP RCF. In the rat model, transplantation of VP22-eGFP expressing RCF led to VP22-eGFP fusion protein delivery to an area of myocardial tissue that was 20-fold greater than that observed when eGFP RCF were transplanted. This area appeared to reach a steady state between 7 and 10 days after transplantation. The VP22-eGFP area consisted of eGFP-positive endothelium, smooth muscle cells, and cardiac myocytes with delivery to an area of approximately 1 mm2 of myocardial tissue. Our data suggest a viable strategy for the delivery of proteins that are not naturally secreted or internalized, and provide the first insight into the feasibility and effectiveness of cell-penetrating proteins combined with cell transplantation in the heart."

9040305	"The extreme climate of the Canadian Prairies poses a major challenge to improve yield. Although it is possible to breed for yield per se, focusing on yield-related traits could be advantageous because of their simpler genetic architecture. The Canadian flax core collection of 390 accessions was genotyped with 464 simple sequence repeat markers, and phenotypic data for nine agronomic traits including yield, bolls per area, 1,000 seed weight, seeds per boll, start of flowering, end of flowering, plant height, plant branching, and lodging collected from up to eight environments was used for association mapping. Based on a mixed model (principal component analysis (PCA) + kinship matrix (K)), 12 significant marker-trait associations for six agronomic traits were identified. Most of the associations were stable across environments as revealed by multivariate analyses. Statistical simulation for five markers associated with 1000 seed weight indicated that the favorable alleles have additive effects. None of the modern cultivars carried the five favorable alleles and the maximum number of four observed in any accessions was mostly in breeding lines. Our results confirmed the complex genetic architecture of yield-related traits and the inherent difficulties associated with their identification while illustrating the potential for improvement through marker-assisted selection."
4542757	"Medullary sponge kidney (MSK) is a kidney malformation that generally manifests with nephrocalcinosis and recurrent renal stones; other signs may be renal acidification and concentration defects, and pre-calyceal duct ectasias. MSK is generally considered a sporadic disorder, but an apparently autosomal dominant inheritance has also been observed. As MSK reveals abnormalities in both the lower and the upper nephron and is often associated with urinary tract developmental anomalies, its pathogenesis should probably be sought in one of the numerous steps characterizing renal morphogenesis. Given the key role of the GDNF-RET interaction in kidney and urinary tract development and nephrogenesis, anomalies in these molecules are reasonable candidates for explaining a disorder such as MSK. As a matter of fact, we detected two, hitherto unknown, rare variants of the GDNF gene in MSK patients. We surmise that a defective distal acidification has a central role in MSK and is followed by a chain of events including defective bone mineralization, hypercalciuria, hypocitraturia and stone formation."
3464385	"Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory and hyperproliferative skin disease with a genetic basis. While epidermal hyperplasia and altered keratinocyte differentiation are prominent features, considerable evidence indicates that psoriasis is immunologically mediated. Recently, the identification of HLA-Cw6 as the disease allele conferring susceptibility to psoriasis has provided a focus for elucidation of these events. In this article, we will focus on the epidemiology of psoriasis and its associated arthritis."
4631977	Kidney transplantation has become the treatment of choice for patients with end-stage renal disease because of better surgical techniques and the availability of more powerful immunosuppressive drugs. Regimens of immunosuppression should combine both short-term outcomes and predictors of long-term safety and survival. The value of tacrolimus for immunosuppression protocols lies in its ability to reduce the immunologic risk to the allograft and its excellent safety profile. Outcomes for kidney-transplant recipients can be further optimized by individualizing therapy to address each patient's risk profile.
3788959	"Stem cell-supported high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) is currently being evaluated in patients with high-risk primary breast cancer (HRPBC), as defined by extensive axillary lymph node involvement. Conclusive results from randomized studies with sufficient patient numbers and follow-up are pending. We retrospectively analyzed 144 HRPBC patients enrolled in a single-arm trial of tandem HDCT at the University of Heidelberg to evaluate the prognostic value of nodal ratio, HER2/neu status, and cytokeratin-positive bone marrow cells and to compare the outcomes of these patients with those of a conventionally treated control group of 91 patients matched by nodal ratio, tumor size, combined hormone-receptor status, and HER2/neu status. The tandem HDCT regimen consisted of 2 cycles of induction chemotherapy followed by 2 cycles of blood stem cell-supported high-dose ifosfamide, 12 g/m2; carboplatin, 900 mg/M2; and epirubicin, 180 mg/m2. Conventionally treated patients received a regimen containing anthracycline without taxanes (52 patients) or CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-flurouracil; 39 patients). With a median follow-up of 3.8 years, disease-free, distant disease-free, and overall survival rates were 62%, 65%, and 84%, respectively. In univariate analysis, besides the hormone receptor status (P = .007), HER2/neu overexpression was the strongest predictor of earlier death (P = .017). In multivariate analysis, a nodal ratio of >    or =0.8 was found to be the only independent predictor of relapse (relative risk [RR] = 2.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21-3.60; P = .008) and only the absence of hormone receptors was associated with earlier death (RR = 3.59; 95% CI, 1.45-8.86; P = .006). Despite a trend toward later distant relapse after HDCT compared with standard-dose chemotherapy with a median follow-up of 3 years (P = .059), thus far, matched-pair analysis has not demonstrated significantly better survival rates after HDCT in all matched patients (P = .786) or in the subgroups of anthracycline-treated patients and patients with and without overexpression of HER2/neu. So far, the follow-up time has been too short to draw definite conclusions; however, patients with a nodal ratio of >    or =0.8, receptor-negative tumors, or HER2/neu overexpression are at high risk for relapse and death, irrespective of the kind of adjuvant chemotherapy."
4639681	"We report a case of a 2-week-old white female who presented with large stellate atrophic skin defects on bilateral thighs and knees at birth. The pregnancy was complicated by the death of monozygotic twin at the 16th week of gestation. This represents aplasia cutis congenita with fetus papyraceus. This rare condition is defined as the congenital skin defect and intrauterine death of fetus with or without a stillborn fetus pressed flat by the growing twin (fetus papyraceus) at delivery time. Aplasia cutis congenita coexisting with fetus papyraceus has a distinctive and reproducible distribution pattern of bilateral symmetrical truncal, buttock, and thigh lesions related to fetal death during the late first to early second trimester. There are at least 44 reported cases of this disorder in the English literature. We discuss our case and review the literature."
9221983	"Smoking and alcohol may contribute as triggering factors for psoriasis and are substantial for managing severely affected psoriasis patients.                                                                                   To evaluate the general state of smoking and alcohol intake in a group of hospitalized, severely affected patients with psoriasis in comparison with the general population of Germany.                                                                              A retrospective, multicentre study analysing data from 1,203 patients with severe psoriasis was performed.                                                                              43.3% of all patients were found to be active smokers (males: 46.6%; females: 39.2%) with a higher likelihood as the control group (odds ratio, OR, 2.08, 95% confidence interval, CI, 1.81-2.39; p <    0.0001). 14.9% of all patients were found to be excessive drinkers (female patients: 5.5%; male patients: 22.3%), more likely than the control group (OR 3.10, 95% CI 2.53-3.80; p <    0.0001); males had an OR of 2.86 (95% CI 2.29-3.56; p <    0.0001) and females an OR of 5.12 (95% CI 3.12-8.39; p <    0.0001).

Disease severity is correlated with smoking in both genders as well as with alcohol intake in female patients."
1344836	"Adequate alveolar ridges are fundamental to successful rehabilitation with implants. There are diverse techniques for reconstructing atrophied ridges, of which bone substitute grafts is one possibility.                                                                                The aim of this study was to carry out radiological and histomorphometric evaluations of bone response to collagenized porcine bone xenografts over a 4-month period following their insertion in rabbits' tibiae.                                                                                           Twenty New Zealand rabbits were used. Twenty collagenized porcine bone xenografts (Osteobiol® mp3, Tecnoss Dental s.r.l., Torino, Italy), in granulated form of 600 to 1,000 µm, were inserted in the proximal metaphyseal area of the animals' tibiae and 20 control areas were created. Following implantation, the animals were sacrificed in four groups of five, after 1, 2, 3, and 4 months, respectively. Radiological and histomorphometric studies were made.                                                                              After 4 months, radiological images revealed bone defects with a decrease in graft volume and the complete repair of the osseous defect. No healed or residual bone alterations attributable to the presence of the implants were observed. Histomorphometric analysis at 4 months found mean values for newly formed bone, residual graft material, and non-mineralized connective tissue of 25.4 ± 1.8%, 36.37 ± 3.0%, and 38.22 ± 2.5%, respectively. There were no statistical differences in the length of cortical formation with collagenized porcine xenograft (98.9 ± 1.1%) compared with the control samples (99.1 ± 0.7%) at the end of the study period.

9868331	"Agricultural crop databases maintained in gene banks of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) are valuable sources of information for breeders. These databases provide comparative phenotypic and genotypic information that can help elucidate functional aspects of plant and agricultural biology. To facilitate data sharing within and between these databases and the retrieval of information, the crop ontology (CO) database was designed to provide controlled vocabulary sets for several economically important plant species.                                                                                  Existing public ontologies and equivalent catalogues of concepts covering the range of crop science information and descriptors for crops and crop-related traits were collected from breeders, physiologists, agronomists, and researchers in the CGIAR consortium. For each crop, relationships between terms were identified and crop-specific trait ontologies were constructed following the Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) format standard using the OBO-Edit tool. All terms within an ontology were assigned a globally unique CO term identifier.                                                                                        The CO currently comprises crop-specific traits for chickpea (Cicer arietinum), maize (Zea mays), potato (Solanum tuberosum), rice (Oryza sativa), sorghum (Sorghum spp.) and wheat (Triticum spp.). Several plant-structure and anatomy-related terms for banana (Musa spp.), wheat and maize are also included. In addition, multi-crop passport terms are included as controlled vocabularies for sharing information on germplasm. Two web-based online resources were built to make these COs available to the scientific community: the 'CO Lookup Service' for browsing the CO; and the 'Crops Terminizer', an ontology text mark-up tool.                                                                                      The controlled vocabularies of the CO are being used to curate several CGIAR centres' agronomic databases. The use of ontology terms to describe agronomic phenotypes and the accurate mapping of these descriptions into databases will be important steps in comparative phenotypic and genotypic studies across species and gene-discovery experiments."

We evaluated in 18 patients the persistence of hyaluronic acid (HA) filler injected into labial tissue analyzing hyaluronidase (HYAL) activity by means of in vitro and in vivo tests, MRI and histological and ultra-structural examination at 3 and 6 months postop.                                                                              MRI examination revealed the presence of HA filler in a clear hyperintense area. Histology demonstrated fibroblast activation. The amount and the degradation rate of HYAL and HA did not show a linear correlation.                                                                                     MRI demonstrated the presence of HA in lip tissue even after 6 months. Biopsies at 3 months revealed tissue maturation and at 6 months confirmed the ability of HA to reorganize and integrate the extracellular matrix. The absence of linear correlation between HYAL and HA revealed that the result clinically is probably dependent on systemic factors which can determine HYAL activity and therefore HA longevity."
6701354	"Alopecia areata (AA) is a T-cell-driven autoimmune disease of the hair follicle and frequently reported to be associated with inflammatory skin diseases (ISD) such as atopic eczema (AE) or psoriasis. Interestingly, AA on the one hand and both AE and psoriasis on the other hand are believed to be driven by mutually antagonistic T-cell subsets.                                                                                  To characterize AA-specific T-cell profiles and inflammatory pattern by intra-individual comparison of AA and coexistent ISD.                                                                              112 patients with AA were recruited and investigated for coexisting ISD. In-depth analyses were performed in patients with AA and AE (n = 2), AA and psoriasis (n = 1), AA and psoriasis and AE (n = 1) and AA and lichen planus (n = 1), using histology, immunohistochemistry and cytokine staining of T cells isolated from lesional skin.                                                                              Of 112 AA patients investigated, 23 suffered from an ISD. The prevalence of AE, vitiligo, psoriasis and lichen planus was higher in the investigated AA cohort than in the normal population. The clinical as well as histological phenotype of AA the coexistent ISD were unequivocal. In line with this, T-cell infiltrates were found to be disease-characteristics with AA and lichen planus dominated by CD8+ and IFN-γ+ TNF-α+ producing T cells while psoriasis lesions in the same patients were dominated by IL-17+ and AE by IL-4+ T cells.                                                                                     AA patients have a higher incidence of various T-cell-driven inflammatory skin diseases than the normal population, a phenomenon which might relate to over-activation of skin-homing T cells and to specific immune triggers as the primary cause of inflammation. More importantly, we showed that by using AA as a model disease, our approach of intra-individual comparison of distinct inflammatory responses in the same patient is feasible and offers the unique possibility to gain insights into disease pathogenesis independent from genetic susceptibilities."
5445255	"Water stress stimulates sucrose synthesis and inhibits starch synthesis in wild-type tubers. Antisense and co-suppression potato transformants with decreased expression of sucrose-phosphate synthase (SPS) have been used to analyse the importance of SPS for the regulation of this water-stress induced change in partitioning. (i) In the absence of water stress, a 70-80% decrease in SPS activity led to a 30-50% inhibition of sucrose synthesis and a slight (10-20%) increase of starch synthesis in tuber discs in short-term labelling experiments with low concentrations of labelled glucose. Similar changes were seen in short-term labelling experiments with intact tubers attached to well-watered plants. Provided plants were grown with ample light and water, transformant tubers had a slightly lower water and sucrose content and a similar or even marginally higher starch content than wild-type tubers. (ii) When wild-type tuber slices were incubated with labelled glucose in the presence of mannitol to generate a moderate water deficit (between -0.12 and -0.72 MPa), there was a marked stimulation of sucrose synthesis and inhibition of starch synthesis. A similar stimulation was seen in labelling experiments with wild-type tubers that were attached to water-stressed wild-type plants. These changes were almost completely suppressed in transformants with a 70-80% reduction of SPS activity. (iii) Decreased irrigation led to an increase in the fraction of the dry-matter allocated to tubers in wild-type plants. This shift in allocation was prevented in transformants with reduced expression of SPS. (iv) The results show that operation of SPS and the sucrose cycle in growing potato tubers may lead to a marginal decrease in starch accumulation in non-stressed plants. However, SPS becomes a crucial factor in water-stressed plants because it is required for adaptive changes in tuber metabolism and whole plant allocation."
2708461	"Formation of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) requires the scaffolding adaptor protein (AP) complexes, which are conserved across all eukaryotes. The Arabidopsis genome encodes five AP complexes (AP-1 to AP-5), and each complex consists of four subunits. In this study, we characterized the poorly defined AP-1 complex by using genetics, proteomics and live cell imaging. We showed that the AP-1 µ adaptin subunit (AP1M2) was localized to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and interacted physically with the AP-1 subunits in Arabidopsis. During treatment with brefeldin A (BFA), the functional fluorophore-tagged AP1M2 relocated to the BFA compartment. The AP1M2 loss-of-function mutant ap1m2 displayed deleterious growth defects, which were particularly evident in the compromised cytokinesis that was revealed by the presence of cell wall stubs in multinucleate cells. Immunolocalization of the cytokinesis-specific syntaxin KNOLLE (KN) in ap1m2 showed that KN was mislocalized and aggregated around the division plane, while a secretory marker targeting to the cell plate remained unaffected. Taken together, we propose that the AP-1 complex is required for cell plate-targeted trafficking of KN in dividing plant cells, and that it has a common role in mediating plant and yeast/animal cytokinesis systems which are fundamentally different."

The PERV infectivity was analyzed using a co-culture of NHDF and PK15 cells. Quantification of PERV A, B DNA and PERV A, B RNA was performed by real-time QPCR and QRT-PCR. The analysis of the expression profile was performed using HG-U133A 2.0 oligonucleotide microarrays.                                                                              PERV infection of NHDF cells with LPS stimulation resulted in a statistically significant decrease in the copy number of PERV A DNA, and an increase in the copy number of PERV A RNA compared to fibroblasts without stimulation. There was no statistically significant difference between the copy number of PERV B RNA of LPStreated and untreated NHDF cells. Typing of differentiation genes was performed in a panel of 571 selected transcripts of inflammation-related genes. Among all studied genes, 23 were differentially regulated with a change greater that 1.1-fold and p<   0.05 in all studied groups. Of these 23 genes, 3 were found to be regulated by more than 2.0-fold at least in 2 studied groups (IL6, IL8, and IL33).

Treatment with colchicine, triamcinolone, diphenhydramine, or dapsone.                                                                                            Maximum eschar size as well as histologic grading of depth, inflammation, and thrombosis.                                                                              There was no significant difference with respect to eschar size (1-way analysis of variance, P = .003). There was no significant difference between any treatment with respect to presence or absence of ulcer, necrosis, large vessel vasculitis, or small vessel vasculitis. The only outcome of significance was that triamcinolone offered protection from thrombosis (chi2 likelihood ratio, P = .04). We also noted evidence of coagulopathy in all of the envenomated animals. The rabbits had grossly elevated activated partial thromboplastin time results, which were corrected with 1:1 mixing with normal rabbit plasma, suggesting an acquired factor deficiency. We did not detect an individual factor deficiency or a lupus anticoagulant.                                                                                      In a rabbit model, none of the agents tested (dapsone, diphenhydramine, colchicine, and intralesional triamcinolone) had an effect on eschar size. Triamcinolone appeared to offer some protection against histologic evidence of thrombosis, but this protection did not translate into a difference in clinical outcome. All animals developed evidence of coagulopathy, regardless of treatment. The coagulopathy could be corrected by fresh rabbit plasma, suggesting an acquired factor deficiency."
4105727	"Keratinization, the orderly process of differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes from stratum basale to stratum corneum, is influenced by hormones and vitamins. We have used expression of epidermal keratins as a paradigm of keratinization processes and analyzed the effects of retinoic acid, thyroid hormone, and vitamin D3 on keratin gene expression. DNA constructs in which keratin gene promoters drive expression of reporter genes were co-transfected with vectors expressing nuclear receptors for the above molecules into various cell types. The keratin promoters studied included K3, K5, K10, K14, and K16. The recipient cell types were HeLa and primary cultures of rabbit corneal and esophageal epithelial cells and of human epidermal keratinocytes. We found that retinoic acid, via its nuclear receptor, suppresses expression of all the above-listed keratin genes. Thyroid hormone and its receptor similarly suppressed those genes. The site of interaction between these two receptors and the promoter sequences of K10 and K14 genes has been identified. Surprisingly, vitamin D3 and its receptor had no direct effect on keratin promoters. Our results suggest that a retinoic acid has a twofold effect on keratin gene expression: by regulating keratinocyte differentiation it determines which keratins are expressed, basal cell specific or differentiation specific; by direct interaction between its receptor and keratin genes, retinoic acid determines the total amount of keratin protein within the cell. Vitamin D3, on the other hand, also regulates keratinocyte differentiation, but does not directly interact with the keratin genes."
2828832	"The role of PQ (plastoquinione) redox state in establishment of response to pathogen infection (Botrytis cinerea) was tested along the regulation of main antioxidative enzymes (superoxide dismutase - SOD, catalase - CAT) and photochemistry of PSII (photosystem II) in Mesembryanthemum crystallinum plants performing C3 and CAM (Crassulacean acid metabolism) carbon metabolism. The redox state of PQ was modified by two inhibitors of photosynthetic electron transport resulting in a more oxidised (3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea; DCMU) or reduced (2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-p-benzoquinone; DBMIB) PQ redox state simulating darkness and high light conditions, respectively. Irrespective of the type of treatment (mock inoculation or pathogen inoculation) SOD activity depended on the PQ pool. Our results suggest that regarding changes in infection-induced CAT activity, plants developed response that is vital for hypersensitive-like (HR-like) response establishment only when PQ pool generated signal was similar to that in light presence (DBMIB pre-treatment). When PQ pool generated signal was similar to darkness, CAT activity response remained stress-independent, similarly to SOD. Fluorescence parameters of PSII, Qp (photochemical quenching coefficient) and NPQ (non-photochemical quenching) were affected only in the tissues treated with DCMU in stress-independent manner. We suggest that in case of abiotic and biotic stresses signals emerging from PQ pool indirectly orchestrate plant response and carbon metabolism affects this regulatory pathway."
7845685	"Titration of urease from pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L.), a hexameric protein (mol. wt. 480000; subunit mol. wt. 80000), with 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate) (DTNB) reveals the presence of 5.82+/-0.13 'accessible' sulfhydryl groups per molecule of the enzyme protein (i.e. about one 'accessible' SH group per subunit). Denatured enzyme was found to titrate for 12.1+/-0.1 SH groups per molecule (i.e. about two SH groups per subunit). Half of the 'accessible' groups react faster than the remaining at pH 8.5 as well as pH 7.5. However, the reaction was slower at pH 7.5 than 8.5. Time-dependent loss of enzyme activity with DTNB was also found to be biphasic. The enzyme was inactivated at low concentration of p-chloromercuribenzoate (p-CMB), N-ethyl maleimide (NEM) and iodoacetamide. The inactivation reactions were biphasic, with half of the activity lost more rapidly than the remaining half. The loss of activity with p-CMB was linearly related to the blocking of accessible SH groups. Inactivation by p-CMB is largely reversible by addition of excess of cysteine. Fluoride ion strongly protects the enzyme against NEM inactivation, however, substrate urea provides much weaker protection against SH group reagents. The significance of these results is discussed."
7809360	"Interferon regulatory factor-1 is a transcription factor that is linked to the expression of genes important in the initiation of the inflammatory response and the control of cell cycle. In this study, we determined that the generation of interferon regulatory factor-1 expression in human dermal microvascular endothelial cells was transcriptionally mediated by tumor necrosis factor-alpha or interferon-gamma via iron-dependent pathways. The induction of interferon regulatory factor-1 protein and the up-regulation of interferon regulatory factor-1 mRNA levels was inhibited when cells were pretreated with the iron chelators 2-2-dipyridyl or deferoxamine. This inhibition of interferon regulatory factor-1 expression was associated with loss of interferon regulatory factor-1 binding to the interferon-stimulated response element as assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Addition of exogenous iron with the iron chelator resulted in reconstitution of cytokine responsiveness, thus demonstrating iron as the target for the chelator effect. Both tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma-induced interferon regulatory factor-1 gene transcription, as assessed by the measurement of unspliced, nascent, heterogeneous nuclear RNA, and treatment with iron chelators blocked tumor necrosis factor-alpha or interferon-gamma mediated interferon regulatory factor-1 gene transcription. Iron was not essential, however, for the association of interferon regulatory factor-1 mRNA with polyribosomes, suggesting iron was not essential for interferon regulatory factor-1 protein translation. Through such inhibitory regulation on pro-inflammatory transcription factors, iron chelators may serve as anti-inflammatory agents."
1167439	"Cardiac allograft vasculopathy is an important cause of long-term graft loss. In adults, percutaneous revascularization procedures (PRPs) have variable success with high restenosis rates and little impact on graft survival. Limited data exist in pediatric recipients of transplants.                                                                              Data from the Pediatric Heart Transplant Study (PHTS) were used to explore associations between PRPs and outcomes after heart transplant in patients listed ≤18 years old who received a first heart transplant between 1993 and 2009.                                                                              Revascularization procedures were done in 28 of 3,156 (0.9%) patients; 13 patients had multiple PRPs giving a total of 51 PRPs performed across 15 centers. Mean recipient age at time of transplant was 7.7 ± 6.7 years; mean donor age was 15.9 ± 15.4 years. The mean time to first PRP was 5.7 ± 3.2 years. Vessels involved were left anterior descending artery (41%), right coronary artery (25%), circumflex artery (18%), other coronary branches/unknown (16%). PRPs consisted of 38 (75%) stent implantations and 13 (25%) balloon angioplasties with an overall procedural success rate of 73%. Freedom from graft loss after PRPs was 89%, 75%, and 61% at 1, 3, and 12 months. In addition, patients with transplants from donors >   30 years old were found to have less freedom from the need for a revascularization procedure than patients with transplants from younger donors (p <    0.0001).                                                                                      In this large pediatric heart transplant cohort, use of PRPs for cardiac allograft vasculopathy was rare, likely related to procedural feasibility of the interventions. Despite technically successful interventions, graft loss occurred in 39% within 1 year post-procedure; relisting for heart transplant should be considered."
3904433	"Partial cDNAs of myb-related regulatory genes were isolated from the tetraploid Kyoho grape ( Vitis labruscana: V. labrusca x V. vinifera) and the expression patterns of the corresponding genes were studied. Since MybA gene expression is closely related to coloring and/or ripening of the berry (expression increases strongly with the commencement of coloring and berry softening, and is detected only in berry skin and flesh), full-length cDNAs for the gene were isolated from a mature-berry cDNA library. Three different species of MybA were identified from the cDNA sequences. Delivery of these cDNAs to somatic embryos of grape led to the induction of reddish-purple spots and UDP-glucose:flavonoid 3- O-glucosyltransferase (UFGT) gene expression in non-colored embryos. The UFGT transcript was not detected in control embryos, while other structural genes for anthocyanin biosynthesis were expressed in both control and pigmented embryos. In addition, introduction of the UFGT gene induced the same reddish-purple spots in embryos. In contrast, treatment with the leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase (LDOX) gene failed to induce these spots. Our results strongly suggest that MybA genes are involved in the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis in the grape via expression of the UFGT gene."
1905751	"Vitamin D is produced in the human skin by short wavelength (290-315 nm) ultraviolet (UV) radiation.                                                                                The aim of the study was to investigate how outdoor conditions may influence the serum levels of 25(OH) vitamin D in psoriasis patients under narrowband ultraviolet B (UVB) phototherapy.                                                                              The winter and summer groups of patients received almost the same narrowband UV (nUVB) doses during whole-body phototherapy. The 25(OH)D serum concentration was measured before and after two series of 10 exposures. The cabinet doses were compared with potentially available cumulative solar doses. The solar doses (unweighted UVB and vitamin D effective dose) and duration of solar intensity sufficient to produce vitamin D were calculated using a model based on local atmospheric data.                                                                              After an initial 10 nUVB treatments, 25(OH)D serum concentration increased by 68% for winter patients in relation to the level before therapy, whereas a 20% increase was found for the summer patients. The next 10 treatments caused a much lower increase in 25(OH)D concentration: 5% and 3.5% for the winter and summer patients, respectively. No statistically significant relationship was observed between post-therapy 25(OH)D serum concentration and solar radiation variability.                                                                                      The different baseline values of 25(OH)D serum levels in winter and summer patients result from seasonal variability in solar irradiance. Thus, outdoor solar radiation affects the patients over a much longer period, and artificial UV light is the main factor responsible for increase in 25(OH)D serum level over a 30-day period of cabinet therapy."
1951622	"Calcitonin gene-related peptide has been shown to modulate inflammatory and immune responses in various systems. Recent studies in our laboratory and colleagues have shown that intracutaneously injected calcitonin gene-related peptide impairs the induction of contact hypersensitivity in mice, and participates in the pathogenesis of failed contact hypersensitivity induction after acute, low-dose ultraviolet B radiation. In this study we investigated the ability of calcitonin gene-related peptide to induce tolerance in normal and mast cell deficient mice and we examined the extent to which calcitonin gene-related peptide contributes to the tolerance induced by acute, low-dose ultraviolet B radiation. Calcitonin gene-related peptide was injected intradermally followed by application of 2,4-dinitro-1-fluorobenzene to the injected skin surface. Tolerance was assessed by re-exposing the mice 2 wk later to a second, sensitizing dose of 2, 4-dinitro-1-fluorobenzene on uninjected skin. We found that calcitonin gene-related peptide induced tolerance to 2, 4-dinitro-1-fluorobenzene in both normal and mast cell deficient mice. Calcitonin gene-related peptide-induced tolerance was blocked by intradermal injection of a calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonist [CGRP-(8-37)] that selectively blocks the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor. Tolerance was also abolished by intraperitoneally injected anti-interleukin-10, but not anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha, antibodies. When 2,4-dinitro-1-fluorobenzene was painted on skin into which splenic dendritic cells pretreated with calcitonin gene-related peptide had been injected, tolerance was observed. Calcitonin gene-related peptide- treated dendritic cells mixed with anti-interleukin-10 antibody prior to intradermal injection failed to promote tolerance. Finally, injection of CGRP-(8-37) into skin that was subsequently exposed to acute, low-dose ultraviolet B radiation partially prevented tolerance induced by local application of 2,4-dinitro-1-fluorobenzene. These results indicate that calcitonin gene-related peptide has the capacity to promote cutaneous tolerance through an interleukin-10-dependent mechanism. This mechanism, which does not require the participation of mast cells, contributes to the tolerance promoted by acute, low-dose ultraviolet B radiation. Thus, calcitonin gene-related peptide from cutaneous nerve endings plays a key role in the local immune aberrations caused by ultraviolet B radiation."

5036509	"Although sex and gender are becoming more important in diagnostics and therapy, there is still little knowledge about sex-specific differences in chronic pruritus (CP).                                                                                   To compare, taking into consideration the characteristics of pruritus, sex-specific differences in psychological symptoms in patients with CP.                                                                              Sociodemographic data, data on the clinical characteristics of the skin and CP were documented over a 1-year period in all patients attending the Competence Center Chronic Pruritus of the University Hospital Münster for the first time. All patients completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Student's t-tests for independent study groups and linear regression analyses were applied.                                                                              A total of 619 patients (278 men, 341 women) were included in the analysis. Women were more anxious than men, but were not more depressed. A linear regression analysis indicated that depression and anxiety scores in women were related to the average intensity of pruritus during the previous 4 weeks and to a more generalized pruritus at the beginning of CP; older age in women also correlated with the scores on the depression subscale. Interestingly, the associations were different in men: scores on the depression scale were associated with the diagnosis of CP pruritus with multiple scratch lesions.                                                                                      There are sex-specific differences in the relationship between the psychological symptoms and clinical characteristics of CP; higher anxiety scores were achieved by women. Whether psychological symptoms can be reversed when CP and scratch lesions improve is an issue that needs further exploration."

9163296	"Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome refers to the concomitant occurrence of connective tissue nevi, composed of elastic fibers in most cases, with osteopoikilosis. This autosomal dominant inherited disorder is caused by mutations in the gene LEMD3 on chromosome 12q14, which induces a rather heterogeneous clinical phenotype. Here, we report on the most proximal germline mutation found to date in the LEMD3 gene, p.Val94fs, in a three-generation Swiss family. Quantitative RNA analyses in affected and non-affected skin tissue from the proband demonstrate a comparable nonsense-mediated decay of mutant LEMD3 mRNA in both tissues; however, different levels of tropoelastin expression suggest that additional factors are involved in the development of the cutaneous lesions."
4974350	"The past few years have seen significant advancement in the clinical relevance of intraportal islet cell transplantation for treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus. The implementation of novel protocols, such as the one developed by the group of Shapiro and collaborators in Edmonton, has revitalized the enthusiasm for cellular transplantation as a treatment for diabetes by improving the success rates and long-term function of islet grafts. Improved results in clinical islet transplantation reported by the groups in Edmonton, Miami, and Minneapolis have re-proposed the much simpler outpatient cell transplant procedure as an alternative to the more risky and technically challenging whole-organ pancreas transplantation."
4590936	"In a study of the comedolytic action of retinoids on the epidermal pseudocomedones of rhino mouse skin, the earliest changes and the sequence of events induced by the treatment were investigated. Rhino mice were treated topically with all-trans retinoic acid and at various time intervals from day 0 to 3 weeks, histological and ultrastructural studies as well as quantification of mast cells were performed. The earliest changes occurred in the dermis after 2 days of treatment and were characterized by degranulation of mast cells, clumping and association of Langerhans cells and lymphocytes. During the second week of treatment there was hyperplasia, hypergranulosis and an increase in the number of membrane coating granules with disorganization of the horny layer both of the epidermis and the follicular epithelium. These changes in the proliferation and the differentiation of keratinocytes resulted in a comedolytic effect. Associated with these epidermal changes there were changes in the dermis with an increased number of mast cells and a decreased number of Langerhans cells."
8023837	"Nephrotic syndrome (NS) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a rare phenomenon usually associated with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). This systematic review of post-HSCT NS cases reported in the literature aimed to identify risk factors and unique features of the disease in this clinical setting. One hundred sixteen cases of post-HSCT NS published in the English literature between 1988 and 2015 were revealed and analyzed. The median onset of NS was 20.5 months (range, 3 to 174) post-HSCT. NS development was associated with acute or chronic GVHD in 87.2% of cases. Membranous nephropathy (MGN) was the most frequent pathology (65.5%), followed by minimal change disease (MCD) (19%). Complete remission of the NS was achieved in 63.5% of patients (59.1% of MGN cases and 81.3% of MCD cases; P = .15). Patients presenting with MCD recovered at a median of 1.75 months (range, 1 to 12) and with MGN a median of 7 months (range, 1 to 53) (P = .001). NS was treated with corticosteroids alone in 16.8% of patients and with a combination of corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents in 73.5% of patients. Univariate analysis failed to identify a single predictive factor of response to therapy. In conclusion, post-HSCT NS usually develops concomitant to GVHD and is associated with high rates of response to therapy. Although most patients were treated with a combination of immunosuppressive drugs, single-agent therapy with steroids may be sufficient in some cases."
4021597	"In previous studies in humans, mannitol (20%, 250 ml) has been shown to reduce the incidence of acute renal failure (ARF) after transplantation from 54% to 19%. In rats, atrial natriuretic peptide appears to prevent ischemia-induced ARF. We therefore decided to evaluate the effects of alpha-human atrial natriuretic peptide (alpha-h-ANP) both alone and combined with mannitol during transplantation in humans. First, we demonstrated that systemic alpha-h-ANP infusion during kidney transplantation was safe in dosages up to 0.08 micrograms/kg per minute. In these patients the calculated metabolic clearance rate of alpha-h-ANP was relatively low ranging from 0.68 to 1.80 l/min. In a second study of 11 renal graft recipients, no mannitol was used and alpha-h-ANP (0.05 micrograms/kg per minute) was infused into the donor kidney artery during transplantation for 46 +/- 2 min, followed by IV administration for 71 +/- 2 min. Our aim was to reduce the incidence of ARF. Nevertheless, ARF occurred immediately after surgery in four of the patients (36%) in this group and, as a result, mannitol was reintroduced. A third group of nine renal graft recipients received alpha-h-ANP (total dose 400 micrograms) as five IV injections within 90 min after transplantation. ARF occurred in four of these patients (44%). We conclude that alpha-h-ANP, administered according to the aforementioned protocols in such small groups of patients, does not seem to be of value in the prevention of ARF after transplantation."
2778266	"Mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP), an autoimmune subepithelial blistering disease that predominantly affects the mucous membranes, is usually diagnosed in elderly adults. Early diagnosis of MMP is crucial because it tends to run a chronic and progressive course with the potential for devastating scarring of the mucous membranes that may lead to blindness and airway compromise. A subtype of MMP, anti-laminin-332 MMP, is a rare blistering disorder in which autoantibodies are directed against laminin-332 (formerly epiligrin), a structural protein of the epidermal basement membrane. Herein we report what we believe to be the youngest patient diagnosed with anti-laminin-332 MMP, a 9-year-old girl with disease affecting only the oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal mucosa, with no skin involvement."
7567383	"The use of autologous hematopoietic SCT (auto-HSCT) has expanded to include older patients. Increasing age is a well-appreciated risk factor for the development of atrial fibrillation and/or atrial flutter (AF/AFL) in the general population. As more elderly patients undergo auto-HSCT, the risk of developing AF/AFL post transplant may also increase. However, few data evaluating other risk factors for the development of AF/AFL following auto-HSCT exist. Therefore, we performed a retrospective study to determine the incidence of AF/AFL following auto-HSCT and to determine the risk factors associated with the development of AF/AFL. Patients who developed AF/AFL were compared with a group of patients who received auto-HSCT within the same time period (April 1999 to May 2005) and were within 5 years of age. Of the 516 patients who underwent auto-HSCT at the University of Nebraska Medical Center 44 (8.5%) developed AF/AFL at a median time of 4 days (range, days 1-9) following auto-HSCT. In multivariate analysis, risk factors for developing AF/AFL were older age, odds ratio and 95% CI of 1.14 (1.07-1.21), elevated serum creatinine level, 2.69 (1.00-7.22), history of previous arrhythmia, 9.33 (3.01-28.99), and history of previous mediastinal irradiation, 11.12 (1.33-92.96)."
6324629	"Although portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is no longer considered a contraindication for liver transplantation (OLT), it is still considered a high risk because of the complexity of the surgical procedure. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of PVT in the recipient during OLT on intra- and perioperative management and outcome.                                                                                           Between April 1986 and October 2003, 721 primary OLT included 64 patients (8.8%) with PVT. The underlying liver disease was postnecrotic cirrhosis in most cases (n = 37). Intraoperative (length of surgery, packed red blood cells (PRBC) transfusion requirements, ischemia time, complications) and postoperative parameters (ICU stay and hospitalization time, complications, actuarial graft and patient survival at 1 month and 1 and 5 years) were compared with a control group of patients submitted to OLT without PVT (n = 657).                                                                              Portal flow was reestablished in 56 patients with thromboendovenectomy, in seven patients with a venous graft from the superior mesenteric vein, and with cavoportal hemitransposition in one case. The average ICU and hospital stay as well as the 1-month and 1- and 5-year patient survivals were not significantly different in the PVT versus the control group. We observed slightly more PRBC transfusions and longer surgery procedures in the PVT group.                                                                                      Our experience suggests that thromboendovenectomy is the procedure of choice for PVT. The results are good in terms of survival rates and postoperative complications, although the presence of PVT may lead to more technical problems during surgery."
4229668	"Most plants have the ability to respond to fluctuations in light to minimize damage to the photosynthetic apparatus. A proteolytic activity has been discovered that is involved in the degradation of the major light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding protein of photosystem II (LHCII) when the antenna size of photosystem II is reduced upon acclimation of plants from low to high light intensities. This ATP-dependent proteolytic activity is of the serine or cysteine type and is associated with the outer membrane surface of the stroma-exposed thylakoid regions. The identity of the protease is not known, but it does not correspond to the recently identified chloroplast ATP-dependent proteases Clp and FtsH, which are homologs to bacterial enzymes. The acclimative response shows a delay of 2 d after transfer of the leaves to high light. This lag period was shown to be attributed to expression or activation of the responsible protease. Furthermore, the LHCII degradation was found to be regulated at the substrate level. The degradation process involves lateral migration of LHCII from the appressed to the nonappressed thylakoid regions, which is the location for the responsible protease. Phosphorylated LHCII was found to be a poor substrate for degradation in comparison with the unphosphorylated form of the protein. The relationship between LHCII degradation and other regulatory proteolytic processes in the thylakoid membrane, such as D1-protein degradation, is discussed."
6281071	"Simultaneous hepatic artery and portal vein thrombosis rarely occurs after liver transplantation. The etiology is unknown. Of 213 patients (72 children and 141 adults) that underwent living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) from January 1996 to March 2003, 4 (2%) developed simultaneous thrombosis at 3 hours to 7 days (median, 4 days) after the operation. Emergent thrombectomy was performed in three patients; the remaining patient was registered in the Japan organ transplant network. All of the patients died due to hepatic failure (range, 18 hours to 6 days after the diagnosis; median, 2 days). Portal vein, hepatic artery, and hepatic vein velocity in the liver graft were measured every 12 hours by Doppler ultrasonography for 2 weeks after liver transplantation. These parameters were stable until just before the simultaneous thrombosis. These findings indicate that protocol Doppler ultrasonography can diagnose, but not predict, this fatal complication."
4838289	"To investigate the influence of exposure time and stages of cell growth on the effects of specific COX-2 inhibitor NSAIDs on growth and differentiation of osteoblasts on smooth titanium surfaces.                                                                                            The study was categorized into 5 groups: group A, 0.1 microM indomethacin; group B, 1.5 microM celecoxib; group C, 3.0 microM celecoxib; group D, 9.0 microM celecoxib; and group E, serum-free culture medium without drug treatment. A mouse calvarial cell line, MC3T3-E1, was seeded on acid-prickled surface titanium disks. The investigations were performed in 3 experimental phases based on stages of cell growth: static (24 hours after seeding), log (culture day 5), and plateau (culture day 12). In each experimental phase, cells on titanium disks were incubated in a medium treated with drugs according to the groups of study for 1, 3, and 5 days.                                                                              Indomethacin and celecoxib in groups A to D inhibited growth of cells on treatment days 3 and 5 in static phase and on treatment day 3 in log phase. Additionally, an inhibitory effect of indomethacin was greater than celecoxib. Effects on alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and osteocalcin were not clearly demonstrated. A significant decrease of PGE2 production was found in groups A to D in static and plateau but not log phases.                                                                                     A specific COX-2 inhibitor NSAID, celecoxib, inhibited growth of osteoblasts on titanium surfaces and the effects were influenced by exposure time and stages of cell growth. Using a specific COX-2 inhibitor might cause deterioration of osteointegration of dental implants by interfering with osteoblastic cell growth in the proliferative stage."
2093686	"Genetic studies have provided increasing evidence that proteins involved in all aspects of RNA metabolism, such as RNA processing, transport, stability, and translation, are required for plant development and for plants' responses to the environment. Such proteins act in floral transition, floral patterning, and signaling by abscisic acid, low temperature and circadian rhythms. Although some of these proteins belong to core RNA metabolic machineries, others may have more specialized cellular functions. Despite the limited knowledge of the underlying molecular mechanisms, posttranscriptional regulation is known to play a key role in the control of plant development."
7680108	"Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), a common complication in chronic kidney disease (CKD), is associated with high cardiovascular mortality. The aim of this experimental study was to analyze the effect of different vitamin D receptor activators (VDRAs) on both LVH and myocardial fibrosis in chronic renal failure (CRF).                                                                              Male Wistar rats with CRF, carried out by 7/8 nephrectomy, were treated intraperitoneally with equivalent doses of VDRAs (calcitriol, paricalcitol and alfacalcidol, 5 days per week) during 4 weeks. A placebo group (CRF + vehicle) and a Sham group with normal renal function served as controls. Biochemical, morphological, functional and molecular parameters associated with LVH were evaluated, as well as cardiac fibrosis, collagen I, transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1) expression.                                                                              All VDRAs treatment prevented LVH, with values of cardiomyocyte size, LV wall and septum thickness and heart-body weight ratio similar to those observed in the Sham group. At molecular levels, all VDRAs attenuated atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) expression compared with CRF + vehicle. The phosphorylation of ERK1/2, a signal for activating growth, was stimulated in the CRF + vehicle group; VDRAs use prevented this activation. Paricalcitol was the only VDRA used that maintained in the normal range all parameters associated with myocardial fibrosis (total collagen, collagen I, TGFβ1 and MMP1).                                                                                      Our findings demonstrated that the three VDRAs used induced similar changes in bone metabolic parameters and LVH. In addition, paricalcitol was the only VDRA which showed a relevant beneficial effect in the reduction of myocardial fibrosis, a key factor in the myocardial dysfunction in CKD patients."

3743771	"The management of clinically atypical nevi/dysplastic nevi (CAN/DN) is controversial, with few data to guide the process. Management recommendations for DN with positive histologic margins were developed by the Delphi method to achieve consensus among members of the Pigmented Lesion Subcommittee (PLS) of the Melanoma Prevention Working Group (MPWG) after reviewing the current evidence.                                                                                   To outline key issues related to the management of CAN/DN: (1) biopsies of CAN and how positive margins arise, (2) whether incompletely excised DN evolve into melanoma, (3) current data on the outcomes of DN with positive histologic margins, (4) consensus recommendations, and (5) a proposal for future studies, including a large-scale study to help guide the management of DN with positive margins.                                                                                      The literature, including recent studies examining management and outcomes of DN with positive margins between 2009 to 2014, was reviewed.                                                                               A consensus statement by the PLS of the MPWG following review of the literature, group discussions, and a structured Delphi method consensus.                                                                                                    This consensus statement reviews the complexities of management of CAN/DN. A review of the literature and 2 rounds of a structured Delphi consensus resulted in the following recommendations: (1) mildly and moderately DN with clear margins do not need to be reexcised, (2) mildly DN biopsied with positive histologic margins without clinical residual pigmentation may be safely observed rather than reexcised, and (3) observation may be a reasonable option for management of moderately DN with positive histologic margins without clinically apparent residual pigmentation; however, more data are needed to make definitive recommendations in this clinical scenario."
5709455	"Dengue infection is emerging as a public health problem in India. Despite numerous studies, there is a paucity of literature regarding the cutaneous manifestations of dengue. This study was performed to investigate the prevalence and type of cutaneous manifestations in dengue viral infection.                                                                              Two hundred and fifty-six patients with febrile illness, admitted to the Christian Medical College and Hospital, Ludhiana, India, were studied. On the basis of the clinical criteria and laboratory tests, 124 patients were diagnosed with dengue viral infection, and these patients were investigated in detail. Serologic tests were attempted in only 84 patients, and all of these samples tested positive for anti-dengue immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies.                                                                              Of the 124 patients with dengue infection, 41 (23.1%) were classified with dengue fever (DF) and 83 (66.9%) with dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), four (3.2%) of whom had dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Cutaneous involvement was seen in 46.8% of patients, the most common symptom being maculopapular/morbilliform eruption (48.3%), followed by ecchymotic (27.6%), petechial (13.8%), and macular/scarlatiniform (10.3%) eruption. Maculopapular eruption was observed more in DF, whereas petechiae, ecchymosis, and mucosal involvement were seen more in DHF; 72.4% of patients with cutaneous manifestations were asymptomatic, and 27.6% had pruritus. Involvement was generalized in 48.3% of patients, with the limbs and trunk involved in 32.8% and 18.9% of patients, respectively. Mucosal involvement was seen in 29.8% of patients, with conjunctival involvement being the most common (20.9%), followed by the lips (4.8%), palate (2.4%), and tongue (1.6%).                                                                                      This study describes the variety of cutaneous features associated with dengue viral infection which may evolve during the course of the disease. As a significant proportion of patients showed cutaneous features, these manifestations, together with simple laboratory tests, will be helpful in the early diagnosis of dengue viral infection."
7904647	"Cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita is an uncommon congenital vascular anomaly that is characterized by persistent, reticulated, violaceous pigmentation. We describe a female infant with vascular lesions consistent with this entity who was born to a mother with previously diagnosed systemic lupus erythematosus. Antinuclear antibodies and anti-Ro/SSA antibodies were detected in both mother and infant, supporting a diagnosis of neonatal lupus. This presentation is consistent with the rarely reported association between neonatal lupus and cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita that suggests the latter is part of the cutaneous spectrum of the former. A thorough maternal history and laboratory investigations should be considered for infants with cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita and their mothers in order to rule out the presence of an underlying autoimmune disease."
3455357	"An abnormal vascular status is present in the transplanted kidney. To define whether vascular factors might influence kidney function of the graft, the renal volume, blood flow and vascular resistance of a group of healthy subjects were compared with those of a group of well functioning renal transplants by color Doppler ultrasonography. Sixty healthy subjects and 75 well functioning cadaver renal transplant recipients were compared by color Doppler ultrasonography. Subsequently, 15 couples of donors and recipients of a living related renal graft were compared to observe the differences between the two organs of the same subject in a different environment. The variables studied were: the diameters and the volume of the kidney, renal blood flow and renal resistance index (RI). The group of cadaver renal transplant patients showed higher mean blood pressure (P = 0.009), higher serum creatinine levels (P = 0.0001) and lower endogenous creatinine clearance (P <    0.0001) than healthy controls. The length (P <    0.00001) and volume (P <    0.001) of the kidneys of cadaver transplanted patients were significantly greater than those of healthy subjects, while the length and volume of the living donors kidneys were identical to those of the recipients. RI, measured on renal vessels, showed lower values in healthy subjects and in kidney donors than in transplanted patients (P <    0.00001). Well functioning transplanted kidneys showed increased renal arterial RI. This non-immunologic factor did not appear to be detrimental with renal function in time, at least until 50 months after successful grafting."
8282539	"The purse string suture can be used to provide primary closure for small skin defects or as a partial closure for larger round wounds. The size of the defect is reduced secondary to the tension placed on the suture, which uniformly advances the skin from the entire periphery of the wound.                                                                              We reviewed retrospectively the features of 98 consecutive patients for whom a total of 100 cuticular purse string sutures were used to partially close their postoperative surgical defects. The location and types of the tumors removed were also summarized.                                                                              Postoperative wounds were created following Mohs' micrographic excision of nonmelanoma skin cancer (basal cell carcinoma, 44; squamous cell carcinoma, 25), wide local excision of melanoma (29), or conservative excision of benign cutaneous neoplasms (two). The incidence of purse string suture for partial closure of each tumor was 4.1% for basal cell carcinoma, 7.3% for squamous cell carcinoma, and 46.3% for melanoma. The tumors were equally distributed on the trunk, head and neck, and extremities; however, purse string closures for basal cell carcinomas were more frequent on the trunk, head, and neck, relative to squamous cell carcinomas and melanomas, which were more common on the extremities. Concurrent medical problems and/or the use of an agent with anticoagulant or antiplatelet effects were noted in more than 50% of patients. Absorbable material of thicker diameter was most frequently used for the suture, and the postoperative wound area decreased by 6-90% (mean, 60%) following purse string partial closure. The suture was usually removed after 3-4 weeks. Postoperative complications occurred in six patients: allergic contact dermatitis in two, wound infection in two, exuberant granulation tissue in one, and hypertrophic scar in one. All of the wounds healed completely with either a round or linear scar.                                                                                     The cuticular purse string suture is a rapid and simple procedure that provides complete or partial closure of round skin defects and excellent long-term cosmetic and functional results. This closure provides uniform tension to the wound, enhances hemostasis at the tissue edge, and significantly decreases the size of the defect. Partial wound closure with the purse string suture may be advantageous following the local excision of melanoma, either as definitive surgical wound management or as a temporary partial wound closure prior to subsequent complete repair of the surgical defect. The purse string suture is also useful following nonmelanoma skin cancer removal in patients who insist on maintaining an active lifestyle in the immediate postoperative period, who are receiving one or more systemic anticoagulant and/or antiplatelet agents, and who have large surgical wounds that would require either a skin graft or a local cutaneous flap in order to close the postoperative defect."
1605874	"Seborrheic dermatitis is a common chronic infection of the lipid-rich areas of skin. While seborrheic dermatitis has been a recognized clinical entity for decades, its etiology is far from clear. Early investigators of the development of seborrheic dermatitis focused on the role of the Malassezia (previously Pityrosporum) yeasts. These yeasts are also normal skin commensals, thus their importance as pathogens in this disorder came to be doubted. However, it was subsequently found that treatment of seborrheic dermatitis with an antifungal agent not only resulted in clinical improvement but also reduced the number of Malassezia yeasts on the skin. This has resulted in a resurgence of interest in the Malassezia yeasts. It has been hypothesized that there is an immunological component to seborrheic dermatitis, possibly representing an abnormal host response to the Malassezia yeasts. This paper will discuss the role of Malassezia in the etiology of seborrheic dermatitis, as well as the various treatment options."
2414368	"We published a systematic review on atopic dermatitis (AD) and the hygiene hypothesis in 2005. Since then, the body of literature has grown significantly.                                                                                   We therefore repeated our systematic review to examine the evidence from population-based studies for an association between AD risk and specific infections, childhood immunizations, the use of antibiotics and environmental exposures that lead to a change in microbial burden.                                                                              Medline was searched from 1966 until June 2010 to identify relevant studies.                                                                              We found an additional 49 papers suitable for inclusion. There is evidence to support an inverse relationship between AD and endotoxin, early day care, farm animal and dog exposure in early life. Cat exposure in the presence of skin barrier impairment is positively associated with AD. Helminth infection at least partially protects against AD. This is not the case for viral and bacterial infections, but consumption of unpasteurized farm milk seems protective. Routine childhood vaccinations have no effect on AD risk. The positive association between viral infections and AD found in some studies appears confounded by antibiotic prescription, which has been consistently associated with an increase in AD risk.                                                                                      There is convincing evidence for an inverse relationship between helminth infections and AD but no other pathogens. The protective effect seen with early day care, endotoxin, unpasteurized farm milk and animal exposure is likely to be due to a general increase in exposure to non-pathogenic microbes. This would also explain the risk increase associated with the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Future studies should assess skin barrier gene mutation carriage and phenotypic skin barrier impairment, as gene-environment interactions are likely to impact on AD risk."
7122143	We describe a case of Loefgren's syndrome where the characteristic history and physical exam allowed for the provisional diagnosis to be made in the emergency department.

2354897	"Cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.), a kind of fruit usually harvested at the immature green stage, belongs to non-climacteric fruit. To investigate the contribution of abscisic acid (ABA) to cucumber fruit development and ripening, variation in ABA level was investigated and a peak in ABA level was found in pulp before fruit get fully ripe. To clarify this point further, exogenous ABA was applied to cucumber fruits at two different development stages. Results showed that ABA application at the turning stage promotes cucumber fruit ripening, while application at the immature green stage had inconspicuous effects. In addition, with the purpose of understanding the transcriptional regulation of ABA, two partial cDNAs of CsNCED1 and CsNCED2 encoding 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED), a key enzyme in ABA biosynthetic pathway; one partial cDNA of CsCYP707A1 for 8'-hydroxylase, a key enzyme in the oxidative catabolism of ABA and two partial cDNAs of CsBG1 and CsBG2 for β-glucosidase (BG) that hydrolyzes ABA glucose ester (ABA-GE) to release active ABA were cloned from cucumber. The DNA and deduced amino acid sequences of these obtained genes respectively showed high similarities to their homologous genes in other plants. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that ABA content may be regulated by its biosynthesis (CsNCEDs), catabolism (CsCYP707A1) and reactivation genes (CsBGs) at the transcriptional level during cucumber fruit development and ripening, in response to ABA application, dehydration and pollination, among which CsNCED1, CsCYP707A1 and CsBG1 were highly expressed in pulp and may play more important roles in regulating ABA metabolism."

1564699	"The plant V-type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) does not only serve basic housekeeping functions but is also involved in stress-induced NaCl sequestration during salinity stress. To address the question whether the same isoforms conferring housekeeping functions are equally involved in the response to high salinity, we have isolated cDNA clones for subunits A and c, as representing the peripheral V1 complex and the membrane-integral V0 complex, respectively, from the halotolerant sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L., diploid variety). RNA blot analysis with gene-specific probes revealed a coordinate expression of the cloned subunit A and c isoforms during plant development and in response to high salinity. Also, in rapidly dividing suspension-cultured cells with 10-fold increased transcript amounts as compared to young leaf tissue, the ratio of transcripts for both genes was similar to the ratio found for transcripts in leaves of different age. We have then isolated partial genomic clones (BVA/70 for Beta V-ATPase 70 kDa subunit; BVA/16-1 for Beta V-ATPase 16 kDa subunit), including the promoter regions. Transcription start mapping revealed long 5'-UTR leader sequences (230 and 172 bases, respectively) for both genes. Both promoters contain putative G-box motifs in similar distance to the TATA boxes. For a quantitative comparison of relative promoter strength, the BVA/70 and BVA/16-1 promoters linked to the luciferase reporter gene (LUC) were delivered to sugar beet suspension-cultured cells by particle bombardment. The BVA/16-1 promoter showed a 1.7-fold higher activity as compared with the BVA/70 promoter. Salt treatment induced an increase of BVA/70 (+70%) and BVA/16-1 (+57%) promoter activities, concomitant with increased transcript amounts. The following sequences have been deposited at the EMBL database X98767: Beta vulgaris V-ATPase subunit A, cDNA clone; X98851, B. vulgaris V-ATPase subunit c isoform 1, cDNA clone; Y11038, B. vulgaris V-ATPase subunit A, partial genomic clone; Y11037, B. vulgaris V-ATPase subunit c isoform 1, partial genomic clone."

2602736	"Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease. This excess morbidity cannot be entirely explained by well-recognized conventional and novel risk factors alone, and occurs irrespective of dialysis modality. Recent evidence suggests that the activation of platelets and their interaction with circulating cells are important independent risk factors for atherosclerosis in non-uraemic patients. We therefore studied platelet activation and circulating platelet-leucocyte aggregates in stable patients without evidence of cardiovascular disease on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and haemodialysis and investigated an association with cardiovascular events.                                                                              Immunofluorescent flow cytometry was used to measure the percentage of P-selectin- (CD62P) positive platelets, the percentage of platelet-neutrophil and platelet-monocyte aggregates, and the expression of the P-selectin ligand, P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1, CD162) on leucocytes in haemodialysis and CAPD patients and normal controls. The platelet count and the mean platelet component (MPC, a measure of platelet activation) were determined on the ADVIATM 120 Haematology System (Bayer, NY).                                                                              Platelet activation as assessed by MPC or CD62P expression was significantly increased in haemodialysis but not CAPD patients compared with controls. Circulating platelet-monocyte aggregates were significantly increased in parallel with a significant reduction in PSGL-1 expression on monocytes in both patient groups compared with normal controls. The presence of higher platelet-monocyte aggregates in dialysis patients was associated with increased cardiovascular events.                                                                                     We describe increased platelet-monocyte aggregates with reduced leucocyte PSGL-1 expression in patients with end-stage renal disease irrespective of dialysis modality, associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. These findings may suggest a novel mechanism by which accelerated atherosclerosis occurs in uraemic patients."
3950371	"To study the effect of treatment with cobalt-protoporphyrin (CoPP) for the induction of the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) enzyme on islet engraftment donor mice received either a single intraperitoneal injection of CoPP (20 mg/kg body weight) 1 day prior to islet isolation or this injection plus a 9 day posttransplantation course of Copp. After a single injection of CoPP, the CoPP-induced islets contained higher HO-1 proteins than did the normal islets both at 12 (5.3 +/- 1.5 vs 0.1 +/- 0.1 ng/mg protein, P <    .01) and at 30 hours (6.8 +/- 2.1 vs 0.4 +/- 0.3 ng/mg protein, P <    .05), but not at 56 hours (1.9 +/- 0.8 vs 1.6 +/- 0.8 ng/mg protein, P >    .05). In contrast, diabetic mice that received 75 CoPP-induced islets and a 9-day CoPP injection course posttransplantation showed better improvement in blood glucose levels and body weights than did the mice that only received CoPP-induced islets. Mice of both CoPP-treated groups displayed better improvement in glycemic control than mice that received control islets. At 8 weeks after transplantation, the insulin content of grafts from both CoPP groups was significantly higher than that in the control group. In conclusion, CoPP treatment for the induction of HO-1 enhances engraftment of islets in a syngeneic murine transplantation model."
4233385	"The past decade has seen a tremendous increase in RNA research, which has demonstrated that RNAs are involved in many more processes than were previously thought. The dynamics of RNA synthesis towards their regulated activity requires the interplay of RNAs with numerous RNA binding proteins (RBPs). The localization of RNA, a mechanism for controlling translation in a spatial and temporal fashion, requires processing and assembly of RNA into transport granules in the nucleus, transport towards cytoplasmic destinations and regulation of its activity. Compared with animal model systems little is known about RNA dynamics and motility in plants. Commonly used methods to study RNA transport and localization are time-consuming, and require expensive equipment and a high level of experimental skill. Here, we introduce the λN₂₂ RNA stem-loop binding system for the in vivo visualization of RNA in plant cells. The λN₂₂ system consists of two components: the λN₂₂ RNA binding peptide and the corresponding box-B stem loops. We generated fusions of λN₂₂ to different fluorophores and a GATEWAY vector series for the simple fusion of any target RNA 5' or 3' to box-B stem loops. We show that the λN₂₂ system can be used to detect RNAs in transient expression assays, and that it offers advantages compared with the previously described MS2 system. Furthermore, the λN₂₂ system can be used in combination with the MS2 system to visualize different RNAs simultaneously in the same cell. The toolbox of vectors generated for both systems is easy to use and promises significant progress in our understanding of RNA transport and localization in plant cells."
7807162	"Pachyonychia congenita (PC) is a group of autosomal dominant keratinizing disorders caused by a mutation in one of 4 keratin genes. Previous classification schemes have relied on data from case series and case reports. Most patients in these reports were not genetically tested for PC.                                                                                  We sought to clarify the prevalence of clinical features associated with PC.                                                                              We surveyed 254 individuals with confirmed keratin mutations regarding their experience with clinical findings associated with PC. Statistical comparison of the groups by keratin mutation was performed using logistic regression analysis.                                                                              Although the onset of clinical symptoms varied considerably among our patients, a diagnostic triad of toenail thickening, plantar keratoderma, and plantar pain was reported by 97% of patients with PC by age 10 years. Plantar pain had the most profound impact on quality of life. Other clinical findings reported by our patients included fingernail dystrophy, oral leukokeratosis, palmar keratoderma, follicular hyperkeratosis, hyperhidrosis, cysts, hoarseness, and natal teeth. We observed a higher likelihood of oral leukokeratosis in individuals harboring KRT6A mutations, and a strong association of natal teeth and cysts in carriers of a KRT17 mutation. Most keratin subgroups expressed a mixed constellation of findings historically reported as PC-1 and PC-2.                                                                                      Data were obtained through questionnaires, not by direct examination. Patients were self- or physician-referred.                                                                                      We propose a new classification for PC based on the specific keratin gene affected to help clinicians improve their diagnostic and prognostic accuracy, correct spurious associations, and improve therapeutic development."
5725236	"Most aerial parts of the plant body are products of the continuous activity of the shoot apical meristem (SAM). Leaves are the major component of the aerial plant body, and their temporal and spatial distribution mainly determines shoot architecture. Here we report the identification of the rice gene PLASTOCHRON3 (PLA3)/GOLIATH (GO) that regulates various developmental processes including the rate of leaf initiation (the plastochron). PLA3/GO encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase, which is thought to catabolize small acidic peptides and produce small signaling molecules. pla3 exhibits similar phenotypes to pla1 and pla2- a shortened plastochron, precocious leaf maturation and rachis branch-to-shoot conversion in the reproductive phase. However, in contrast to pla1 and pla2, pla3 showed pleiotropic phenotypes including enlarged embryo, seed vivipary, defects in SAM maintenance and aberrant leaf morphology. Consistent with these pleiotropic phenotypes, PLA3 is expressed in the whole plant body, and is involved in plant hormone homeostasis. Double mutant analysis revealed that PLA1, PLA2 and PLA3 are regulated independently but function redundantly. Our results suggest that PLA3 modulates various signaling pathways associated with a number of developmental processes."
3350659	"The phenotypic heterogeneity of psoriasis could be explained by the alternate activation of either T-helper (Th)-1- or Th-17-related cytokines. However, evidence directly supporting this hypothesis is scarce.                                                                                  To characterize the expression of Th-1- and Th-17-related cytokines according to the morphological psoriasis phenotype: guttate vs. plaque.                                                                              In this study, we enrolled 68 patients exhibiting either guttate or plaque psoriasis, and 10 healthy controls. To avoid age-related bias, age matching was performed for each group. Circulating levels of interferon (IFN)-γ, interleukin (IL)-1RA, IL-2, IL-12p40, IL-17A, IL-22, and IL-23 were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Psoriasis-affected tissue was obtained through biopsy sampling from the eight patients who exhibited the most typical morphology. Levels of IL-1RA, IL-12p40, IL-17, IL-22, and IL-23 in the psoriasis tissue samples were measured with western blot analysis.                                                                              ELISAs of the serum samples showed higher levels of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1RA, IL-2, IL-23, and IFN-γ in patients with psoriasis than in healthy controls. However, the inflammatory cytokine levels did not differ significantly between guttate and plaque psoriasis patients. Western blot analysis of psoriatic tissue revealed higher protein levels of Th-1- and Th-17-related cytokines in patients than in healthy controls. The levels of IL-12p40 and IL-23 were unexpectedly higher in plaque tissue than in guttate tissue.                                                                                     The morphological phenotype of psoriasis does not appear to be determined by a specific activation of either the Th-1 or Th-17 pathway. Rather, the cytokine profile influences disease activity and is altered according to the status of the lesion (early or chronic)."

9378974	"One proposed mechanism for the beneficial effect of occlusive dressings on healing is the maintenance of contact between the wound bed and accumulated wound fluid, which is thought to contain growth stimulatory substances. We have examined the effect of human wound fluid on the in vitro growth of human dermal fibroblasts and umbilical vein endothelial cells. Acute wound fluid was collected from six patients undergoing split-thickness skin grafting. The acute wound fluid was sterilely collected daily from underneath a vapor-permeable membrane applied to the donor site and changed every 24 hours for 3 days postoperatively. After seeding in optimal growth media (control) on day 0, cultures of human dermal fibroblasts and umbilical vein endothelial cells were supplemented with or without acute wound fluid on the next day (day 1) and on day 3. As determined by cell counts, 2% acute wound fluid stimulated the growth of human dermal fibroblasts (p less than 0.05) and umbilical vein endothelial cells (p less than 0.01) when these cells were cultured in 2% fetal bovine serum and endothelial growth medium, respectively. Wound fluid from postoperative days 1 or 3 caused the same level of stimulation. The addition of an anti-platelet-derived growth factor antibody to wound fluid resulted in a 45% mean reduction in its stimulatory effect on fibroblast growth (p less than 0.02), suggesting that platelet-derived growth factor contributes to the observed effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
5080021	"Fragrant rice is favoured worldwide because of its agreeable scent. The presence of a defective badh2 allele encoding betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH2) results in the synthesis of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2AP), which is a major fragrance compound. Here, transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) were engineered to target and disrupt the OsBADH2 gene. Six heterozygous mutants (30%) were recovered from 20 transgenic hygromycin-resistant lines. Sanger sequencing confirmed that these lines had various indel mutations at the TALEN target site. All six transmitted the BADH2 mutations to the T1 generation; and four T1 mutant lines tested also efficiently transmitted the mutations to the T2 generation. Mutant plants carrying only the desired DNA sequence change but not the TALEN transgene were obtained by segregation in the T1 and T2 generations. The 2AP content of rice grains of the T1 lines with homozygous mutations increased from 0 to 0.35-0.75 mg/kg, which was similar to the content of a positive control variety harbouring the badh2-E7 mutation. We also simultaneously introduced three different pairs of TALENs targeting three separate rice genes into rice cells by bombardment and obtained lines with mutations in one, two and all three genes. These results indicate that targeted mutagenesis using TALENs is a useful approach to creating important agronomic traits."
5364789	"A 71-year-old woman presented with multiple, flesh-colored, papular lesions on the left dorsal side of the hand which had erupted 5 years earlier. No cafè-au-lait spots, freckles, or Lisch nodules were detected. Family history did not disclose neurofibromas or abnormal pigmentation. Two biopsy specimens of the lesions showed circumscribed, non-encapsulated neurofibromas. Segmental neurofibromatosis is characterized by the unilateral, segmental appearance of neurofibromas and/or cafè-au-lait spots in the absence of genetic transmission. The authors discuss the significance of localized multiple cutaneous neurofibromas in the absence of family history and suggest the possibility of a cutaneous hamartoma."
9255707	"A 40-year-old male human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -positive patient on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) developed bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy with fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) showing yeast cells of Penicillium marneffei. The adenopathy disappeared after 9 months of itraconazole therapy at a dose of 200 mg/day. Seven years later and 2 days following second-line HAART, the patient presented with generalized papulonodules and ulceronecrotic lesions. Biopsy of the skin lesion revealed plenty of yeast forms dividing by binary fission morphologically resembling Penicillium marneffei. Significant improvement was observed at 2 weeks of starting itraconazole 400 mg/day. After 3 months, the dose was reduced to 200 mg/day and advised to continue for 6 months. Penicillosis presenting initially in the form of cervical adenopathy and later, developing typical skin lesions rapidly progressing to ulcerative and necrotic erosions may be due to continued immunosuppression followed by immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)."
8821381	"Utilization of gene silencing effectors, such as microRNA (miRNA) and small hairpin RNA (shRNA), provides a powerful new strategy for human skin care in vivo, particularly for hyperpigmentation treatment and aging prevention. In this study, tyrosinase (Tyr), the rate-limiting enzyme of melanin (black pigment) biosynthesis, was served as a target for treatment of hyperpigmentation in mouse and human skins. There are over 54 native microRNA capable of silencing human tyrosinase for skin whitening and lightening. To this, we have designed a mir-434-5p homologue and used it to successfully demonstrate the feasibility of miRNA-mediated skin whitening and lightening in vitro and in vivo. Under the same experimental condition in the trials, Pol-II-directed intronic mir-434-5p expression did not cause any detectable sign of cytotoxicity, whereas siRNAs targeting the same sequence often induced certain nonspecific mRNA degradation as previously reported. Because the intronic miRNA-mediated gene silencing pathway is tightly regulated by multiple intracellular surveillance systems, including Pol-II transcription, RNA splicing, exosomal digestion and nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD), the current findings underscore the fact that intronic miRNA agents, such as manually re-designed mir-434-5p homologues, are effective, target-specific and safe to be used for skin whitening without any detectable cytotoxic effect. Given that the human skins also express a variety of other native miRNAs, we may re-design these miRNAs based on their individual functions for skin care, which may provide significant insights into areas of opportunity for new cosmetic and/or therapeutical applications."
1114420	"Modern immunology, in many ways, is based on 3 major paradigms: the clonal selection theory (Medawar, Burnet; 1953/1959), the pattern recognition theory (Janeway; 1989), and the danger/injury theory (Matzinger, Land; 1994). The last theory holds that any cell stress and tissue injury including allograft injury, via induction of damage-associated molecular patterns, induces immunity including alloimmunity leading to allograft rejection. On the other hand, the concept precludes that ""non-self "" per se induces immunity as proposed by the two former theories. Today, the danger/injury model has been largely accepted by immunologists, as documented by a steadily increasing number of publications. In particular, overwhelming evidence in support of the correctness of the model has come from recent studies on the gut microbiota representing a huge assemblage of ""non-self. "" Here, harmless noninjurious commensal microbes are protected by innate immunity-based immune tolerance whereas intestinal injury-causing pathogenic microbes are immunology attacked. The ability of the immune system to discriminate between harmless beneficial ""non-self "" to induce tolerance and harmful life-threatening ""non-self "" to induce immunity has apparently emerged during evolution: Protection of innate immunity-controlled beneficial ""non-self "" (eg, as reflected by microbiotas but also by the fetus of placental mammals) as well as immune defense responses to injuring/injured ""non-self "" (eg, as reflected by plant resistance to biotic and abiotic stress and allograft rejection in mammals) evolved under pressure across the tree of life, that is, in plants, lower and higher invertebrates as well as lower and higher vertebrates. And evolution tells us why the overall existence of protected microbiotas really makes sense: It is the formation of the ""holobiont, "" - a metaorganism - that is, the host plus all of its associated microorganisms that - in terms of a strong unit of selection in evolution - provides that kind of fitness to all species on earth to successfully live, survive and reproduce. In other words: ""We all evolve, develop, grow, and reproduce as multigenomic ecosystems! Regarding reproduction, another impressive example of active immunologic protection of ""nonself "" refers to pregnancy in placental mammals that emerged about 400 millions of years ago. Similar to ""non-self "" microbiotas, pregnancy in placental mammals reflects an evolution-driven phenomenon on the basis of innate immunity-controlled tolerance induction to semiallogeneic non-injuring/non-injured ""non-self "" aiming to ensure reproduction! Altogether, the lesson learned from evolution of how to avoid allograft rejection is clear: prevent allograft injury to induce allotolerance, in other words: create a ""transplant holobiont. ""."
7441774	"Glutamate synthase (GOGAT) is a key enzyme in the assimilation of inorganic nitrogen in photosynthetic organisms. We found that, like higher plants, the facultative heterotrophic cyanobacterium Plectonema boryanum had ferredoxin (Fd)- and NADH-dependent GOGATs. The genes glsF, gltB, and gltD were cloned, and structural analyses and target mutageneses demonstrated that glsF encoded Fd-GOGAT and that gltB and gltD encoded the two subunits of NADH-GOGAT. All three mutants lacking one of the GOGAT genes were able to grow photosynthetically and heterotrophically. However, the Fd-GOGAT mutant exhibited a phenotype of marked nitrogen deficiency when grown under conditions of saturating illumination and CO2 supply. In these conditions the rate of the ammonia uptake from the culture medium was slower in the Fd-GOGAT mutant than in the wild type or in the NADH-GOGAT mutant, but no significant differences were found in the rate of the CO2 fixation-dependent O2 evolution among these strains. Our results suggest that, although both Fd- and NADH-GOGATs were operative in the cells growing in light, the contribution of Fd-GOGAT, which directly utilizes photoreducing power for the catalytic reaction, is essential for balancing photosynthetic nitrogen and carbon assimilation."
4874328	"Oral melanoacanthoma is a rare pigmented lesion characterized by sudden appearance and rapid radial growth, mimicking malignant melanoma. Oral melanoacanthoma may present as a solitary or multifocal lesion; however, the characteristics of these two clinical variants have never been addressed. In this study, we present an unusual case of multifocal oral melanoacanthoma and analyze cases of oral melanoacanthoma reported in the literature, with special emphasis on multifocal lesions.                                                                              A thorough MEDLINE search of the literature for cases of oral melanoacanthoma was performed. The demographic and clinical data, histologic features, and immunohistochemical findings were extracted from the full-text articles.                                                                              The literature search yielded 52 patients with 67 lesions. The addition of our case increased this number to 53 patients with 72 lesions, 43 of whom had solitary lesions and 10 of whom had multifocal lesions. There was a female predominance amongst the patients with solitary oral melanoacanthoma (3 : 1), whereas multifocal oral melanoacanthoma showed an equal gender distribution (1 : 1). Multifocal lesions tended to occur more frequently on the palate, and solitary lesions on the buccal mucosa.

5402697	"Internodal cells of a brackish water charophyte, Lamprothamnium succinctum, regulate turgor pressure in response to changes in external osmotic pressure by modifying vacuolar concentrations of KCl. An increase in cytosolic concentration of free Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](c)) is necessary for the progress of turgor regulation induced by hypotonic treatment. Initial changes in membrane potential and [Ca(2+)](c) upon hypotonic treatment were measured to examine the temporal relationship between the two parameters. Fura-dextran (potassium salt, M(r) 10,000, anionic) that had been injected into the cytosol was used to measure [Ca(2+)](c). Membrane potential and membrane conductance under a current-clamp condition were also measured. Decrease in external osmotic pressure by 0.16 Osm induced a simultaneous increase in [Ca(2+)](c) with both depolarization of the membrane and increase in the membrane conductance. Decrease in external osmotic pressure by 0.05 Osm induced a simultaneous increase in [Ca(2+)](c) with membrane depolarization but the increase in membrane conductance started later than the other two processes. There was a close temporal relationship between the increase in [Ca(2+)](c) and membrane depolarization on the initial response of turgor regulation induced by hypotonic treatment."
6692111	Ingrown toenail is a common problem causing significant morbidity. Various procedures used for treating this painful condition were discussed in the literature. OBJETCTIVE: Through a prospective study we aimed to evaluate in a long-term follow-up the efficacy of partial nail plate avulsion combined with phenolic chemical matricectomy for the treatment of Ingrown toenails.                                                                              We recruited outpatient from January 2006 to December 2009; all treated by phenol matricectomy and assured a regular follow up.                                                                              Consecutive 146 patients with a total of 171 Ingrown toenails were enrolled. There was no significant morbidity and the procedure was tolerated well by all patients. The short-term results were excellent. No severe complications occurred during the 21-month follow-up period. The overall recurrence was 2.7 %.

These are circular molecules, 27 125 and 26 095 bp in length, respectively. The greatest difference between the two strains was found in the region encompassed by atp9 and cox2 genes, which was amplified with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and used for preliminary restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. Eight isolates of five mtDNA types were used and RFLP patterns obtained with the restriction enzyme AseI showed that this method seems to have greater discrimination power than the other PCR-RFLP typing method using internal transcribed spacer regions of nuclear DNA."

5822289	"The population of children younger than 5 years old in three widely distributed villages in Punjab, Pakistan, was examined for skin disease in November 1980. Approximately 29% of the children had infectious skin disease, with pyoderma the predominant diagnostic category. There were significant differences in pyoderma prevalence rates between villages, with the suppressive effect of malathion spraying for malaria control on the insect population representing the most likely explanation for the observed differences. These data again emphasize the amount of skin disease, particularly in children, in rural areas of the lesser developed countries, and the desirability of focusing attention on the dermatologic needs of this vast sector of the world's population."
9922409	"Selection genes are routinely used in plant genetic transformation protocols to ensure the survival of transformed cells by limiting the regeneration of non-transgenic cells. In order to find alternatives to the use of antibiotics as selection agents, we followed a targeted approach utilizing a plant gene, encoding a mutant form of the enzyme acetolactate synthase, to convey resistance to herbicides. The sensitivity of sugarcane callus (   Saccharum     spp. hybrids, cv. NCo310) to a number of herbicides from the sulfonylurea and imidazolinone classes was tested. Callus growth was most affected by sulfonylurea herbicides, particularly 3.6 μg/l chlorsulfuron. Herbicide-resistant transgenic sugarcane plants containing mutant forms of a tobacco acetolactate synthase (   als    ) gene were obtained following biolistic transformation. Post-bombardment, putative transgenic callus was selectively proliferated on MS medium containing 3 mg/l 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 20 g/l sucrose, 0.5 g/l casein, and 3.6 μg/l chlorsulfuron. Plant regeneration and rooting was done on MS medium lacking 2,4-D under similar selection conditions. Thirty vigorously growing putative transgenic plants were successfully    ex vitro    -acclimatized and established under glasshouse conditions. Glasshouse spraying of putative transgenic plants with 100 mg/l chlorsulfuron dramatically decreased the amount of non-transgenic plants that had escaped the    in vitro     selection regime. PCR analysis showed that six surviving plants were    als    -positive and that five of these expressed the mutant    als     gene. This report is the first to describe a selection system for sugarcane transformation that uses a selectable marker gene of plant origin targeted by a sulfonylurea herbicide."
3648867	"The quality and quantity of cellulose deposited in the primary and secondary cell walls of plants vary in accordance with their biological function. However, the molecular basis of such cellulose heterogeneity has so far remained unclear. Since enrichment of better-quality cellulose, in terms of increased degree of polymerization and crystallinity, is one of the goals of forest biotechnology, our main objective is to decipher the roles of distinct cellulose synthase (CesA) genes in tree development, with special reference to wood production. Here, we report two full-length CesA cDNAs, PtrCesA3 and PtrCesA4, from an economically important tree aspen (Populus tremuloides). PtrCesA3 is orthologous to the Arabidopsis AtCesA4 gene involved in secondary wall formation, whereas PtrCesA4 is orthologous to the Arabidopsis AtCesA1 gene involved in primary cell wall formation. To define the specific cell types expressing these CesA genes, we explored the natural distribution patterns of PtrCesA3 and PtrCesA4 transcripts in a variety of aspen organs, such as leaves, petiole, stem, and roots, using in situ hybridization with hypervariable region-specific antisense riboprobes. Such a side-by-side comparison suggested that PtrCesA3 is exclusively expressed in secondary-wall-forming cells of xylem and phloem fibers, whereas PtrCesA4 is predominantly expressed in primary-wall-forming expanding cells in all aspen organs examined. These findings suggest a functionally distinct role for each of these two types of PtrCesAs during primary and secondary wall biogenesis in aspen trees, and that such functional distinction appears to be conserved between annual herbaceous plants and perennial trees."
7051761	"Response of maize to photoperiods affects adaption of this crop to environments. We characterize the phenotypes of four temperate-adapted maize foundation parents, Huangzao 4, Chang 7-2, Ye 478 and Zheng 58, and two tropically adapted maize foundation parents, M9 and Shuang M9 throughout the growth stage under three constant photoperiod regimes in a daily cycle of 24 h at 28 °C, and analysed expression of 48 photoperiod response-associated genes. Consequently, long photoperiod (LP) repressed development of the tassels of photoperiod-sensitive maize lines at V9 stage, and caused subsequent failure in flowering; failure of photoperiod-sensitive maize lines in flowering under LP was associated with lower expression of flowering-related genes; photoperiod changes could make a marked impact on spatial layout of maize inflorescence. The larger oscillation amplitude of expression of photoperiod-responsive genes occurred in LP-sensitive maize lines. In conclusion, failure in development of tassels at V9 stage under LP is an early indicator for judging photoperiod sensitivity. The adaptation of temperate-adapted maize lines to LP is due to the better coordination of expression among photoperiod-sensing genes instead of the loss of the genes. High photoperiod sensitivity of maize is due to high expression of circadian rhythm-responding genes improperly early in the light."

9845816	"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) contributes to excessive long-term mortality after liver transplantation (LT); however, little is known about early postoperative CVD mortality in the current era. In addition, there is no model for predicting early postoperative CVD mortality across centers. We analyzed adult recipients of primary LT in the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) database between February 2002 and December 2012 to assess the prevalence and predictors of early (30-day) CVD mortality, which was defined as death from arrhythmia, heart failure, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, thromboembolism, and/or stroke. We performed logistic regression with stepwise selection to develop a predictive model of early CVD mortality. Sex and center volume were forced into the final model, which was validated with bootstrapping techniques. Among 54,697 LT recipients, there were 1576 deaths (2.9%) within 30 days. CVD death was the leading cause of 30-day mortality (40.2%), and it was followed by infection (27.9%) and graft failure (12.2%). In a multivariate analysis, 9 significant covariates (6 recipient covariates, 2 donor covariates, and 1 operative covariate) were identified: age, preoperative hospitalization, intensive care unit status, ventilator status, calculated Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score, portal vein thrombosis, national organ sharing, donor body mass index, and cold ischemia time. The model showed moderate discrimination (C statistic = 0.66, 95% confidence interval = 0.63-0.68). In conclusion, we provide the first multicenter prognostic model for the prediction of early post-LT CVD death, the most common cause of early post-LT mortality in the current transplant era. However, evaluations of additional CVD-related variables not collected by the OPTN are needed in order to improve the model's accuracy and potential clinical utility."
5494514	"The aim of this in vitro study was to develop and test an experimental set-up consisting of a video camera and computer-based optoelectronic motion analysis system, synchronized with a loading device, for studying load-dependent deflections in three dimensions of single implant-supported cantilever beams.                                                                                           One Brånemark System implant was tightly screwed into a steel plate so that the entire implant became submerged. An abutment was attached to the implant and a cast 22-mm-long cantilever gold alloy beam incorporating a prefabricated gold cylinder was attached to the abutment with a prosthetic gold screw. A force transducer was glued on the upper surface of the beam end with its centre 19.4 mm from the centre of the implant abutment gold cylinder unit to register the applied load. A specially designed loading device was used to apply increasing vertical loads of the beam end via the transducer. The motion analysis system was synchronized with the transducer to enable measurements of three-dimensional positional changes of the beam end related to known loads.                                                                              Vertical loads from 15.7 to 40.4 N were applied resulting in vertical positional changes of the beam end ranging from 40.8 to 225.2 μm (z-axis). The corresponding horizontal changes perpendicular to the long axis of the beam (y-axis) due to counterclockwise horizontal rotation of the beam around the abutment- and prosthetic cylinder threads varied from 7.4 to 77.4 μm. This rotation changed the position of the beam end from 11.9 to 49.3 μm along the x-axis of the coordinate system toward the supporting implant.                                                                                     It was possible to arrange an experimental set-up for optoelectronic 3-D measurements within such a limited measurement volume that would permit satisfactory registrations of small load-dependent deflections of the prosthetic beam and implant components."

Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumanii and coagulase negative Staphylococcus were isolated from the biopsy specimen. Surgical excision was performed with success on the buttock."
8680258	"A new chemically modified titanium surface, SLActive, has recently been developed. The results obtained in controlled clinical trials indicate that this implant can be safely used and that it offers predictable results. The goal of this noninterventional study was to verify that the success rates of implants used in daily dental practice are comparable to those reported in controlled clinical trials. This study was a prospective, noninterventional study using implants with a chemically modified surface according to the daily dental practice procedures applied by private practitioners. The choice of the implantation procedure and the loading protocol were the responsibility of the investigator and were chosen according to the patient's needs. Thirty clinical centers actively participated in this study, and 226 patients were treated, of which, 8 patients were lost to follow-up. Because of the noninterventional design of the study, the patients were not selected according to strictly defined inclusion/exclusion criteria. Thus, the study included individuals with risk factors such as smoking (24%), untreated gingivitis or periodontitis (9%), and bruxism (6%). The implants were equally distributed between mandible (46%) and maxilla (54%). A bone augmentation procedure was done in 31% of the cases. Early loading (functional loading between 48 hours and 3 months after implant insertion) was applied most frequently (48%), followed by the conventional loading protocol (3 to 6 months after implant placement, 34%). Immediate restoration and immediate loading were rare (7% and 2%, respectively). Of 276 implants inserted and documented, 5 implants failures were reported, all of which were associated with a sinus floor augmentation procedure. The survival rate was 98.2% at the 1-year follow-up visit. The results showed that implants with a chemically modified surface can be successfully restored with success rates similar to those reported in formal clinical trials under more controlled conditions."

1735699	"Many transplant centres are reluctant to accept alcoholic patients because of their supposed potential for alcoholic recidivism, resulting in graft failure and recurrence of alcoholic liver cirrhosis. From May 1982 to January 1993 80 patients received orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) at our institution either for alcoholic cirrhosis exclusively (n = 58) or for a hepatoma in an alcoholic cirrhosis (n = 22). The outcome of these patients was analysed with particular attention to recurrence of liver disease. Overall survival in this group was 67% and 49% at 1 and 5 years, respectively, with a median follow-up of 45 months. Actuarial survival of patients transplanted since January 1989 (n = 46) and 84% and 82% at 1 and 2 years (median follow-up 31 months). Non-fatal clinical endpoints were analysed in those patients surviving for at least 3 months (n = 61). Return to alcohol abuse was documented in 16 patients at routine short-term out patient check-ups. All patients except one admitted to taking alcohol and showed changes in their laboratory test results. A specific pattern of liver function test values related to alcohol abuse was not detected and at the end of a relapse the liver function values usually returned to pre-event values. Only in one case was toxic injury of the liver related to alcoholic recidivism diagnosed on percutaneous liver needle biopsy or post-mortem examination. Compliance with the required immunosuppressive regimen and social rehabilitation after OLT were excellent. Unwillingness to offer OLT to individuals with alcoholic liver disease because of failure to demonstrate 100% long-term abstinence appears difficult to defend in the face of results showing good survival, compliance and social rehabilitation. The hypothesis of a higher sensitivity of the transplanted liver to a drinking episode and the redevelopment of alcoholic diesease in the new liver was not confirmed in our study population."
5723192	"There is disparity in access to outpatient care for Medicaid beneficiaries. This inequity disproportionately impacts children. Access for children with skin disease may be especially limited.                                                                                  We sought to compare access to dermatologists for new pediatric patients insured by Medicaid versus a private plan.                                                                              We surveyed 13 metropolitan markets by conducting secret-shopper scripted telephone calls to dermatology providers listed by Medicaid health plans. Paired calls, differing by insurance type, were made to each office on the same day, portraying a parent requesting a new appointment for a child with eczema.                                                                              We called the offices of 723 Medicaid-listed providers. Final analysis included 471 dermatologists practicing general dermatology. Of these, an average of 44% refused a new Medicaid-insured pediatric patient. The average wait time for an appointment did not significantly vary between insurance types. Assuming that dermatologists not listed as Medicaid providers do not see Medicaid-insured children, our data indicate that pediatric Medicaid acceptance rates ranged from 6% to 64% by market, with an overall market size-weighted average acceptance rate of 19%. Relative reimbursement levels for Medicaid-insured patients did not correlate with acceptance rates.                                                                                      Although the most current health plan directories were used to create calling lists, these are dynamic. The sample sizes of confirmed appointments were in part limited by a lack of referral letters and/or health plan identification numbers. Only confirmed appointments were used to calculate average wait times.                                                                                      Access to dermatologists is limited for Medicaid-insured children with eczema."
5021930	"Fulminant hepatitis in mice could be induced by gene-transfection of Fas ligand (FasL). However, the mechanisms of this event still remain controversial as to whether it is mediated by direct Fas/FasL interaction and/or neutrophil migration. To investigate the role of exogenous FasL-expression, we established a simple but clear mouse model on which we performed liver transplantation between Fas-mutant mice (MRL-lpr/lpr) and wild-type mice (MRL+/+).                                                                              The controls were nontransplanted wild-type (group 1) and MRL-lpr/lpr (group 2) mice. We obtained recipients with a Fas defect only in the liver (group 3; MRL-lpr/lpr liver graft in wild-type mice) and Fas-defected recipients with Fas-positive livers (group 4; wild-type graft in MRL-lpr/lpr). We successfully expressed FasL in the liver by cotransfection of two types of adenoviral vectors, AxCALNFasL and AxCANCre, with a Cre-loxP switching system.                                                                              FasL-expression in the livers in groups 3 and 4 resulted in animal death due to fulminant hepatitis within 48 hr after administration of the vectors. We obtained similar findings in group 1, whereas the mice in group 2 survived without any evidence of hepatitis. Immune staining revealed a marked infiltration of CD11b-positive cells in group 1 and group 3. Despite the number of apoptotic cells, a few infiltration of CD11b-positive cells were seen in group 4. We observed no remarkable findings in the FasL-expressed livers in group 2.                                                                                     The results indicated that exogenous FasL-expression induces hepatocyte apoptosis both by direct interaction with Fas and by recruiting Fas-positive inflammatory cells. These findings are important for generating a new strategy to prevent hepatitis as well as for understanding the role of the Fas/FasL interaction in the pathophysiology of hepatitis."
9819595	"Childhood psoriasis is more extensive and severe compared with that of adults. Therefore an effective and safe treatment modality is needed. Although a few studies of childhood psoriasis indicate that treatment with calcipotriol is safe and effective, short-term studies cannot reflect the exact effect of calcipotriol on systemic calcium homeostasis. Our purpose was to study the long-term efficacy and safety of calcipotriol for childhood psoriasis. An uncontrolled pilot study, with long-term follow-up for as long as 106 weeks, using open-label calcipotriol ointment was conducted in 12 psoriasis patients less than 15 years of age. Response to treatment was assessed by the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 levels, as well as routine laboratory analyses including serum calcium and phosphate, which were measured before and after the course of treatment. At the end of the study, the patients showed significant improvement in PASI scores compared with the baseline level. No serious side effects, including those related to calcium homeostasis, were detected. The mean values of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, however, were decreased and half of the patients had levels below the normal range. In conclusion, it is thought that calcipotriol ointment is an effective treatment modality for long-term use in childhood psoriasis. However, although not lowering serum calcium and phosphate levels, the long-term use of calcipotriol in childhood may possibly decrease the serum values of endogenous vitamin D. Therefore monitoring of vitamin D metabolites may be necessary during calcipotriol therapy. More investigative studies are needed to resolve this issue."
5075946	"Botox Cosmetic (Botox) is a formulation of the neuromuscular blocking agent botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A). When injected into hyperactive corrugator superciliaris and/or procerus muscles of the face that predominantly control frowning, Botox produces a transient (3- to 6-month), dose-dependent localized muscle weakness, resulting in a temporary improvement in glabellar frown lines ('brow furrows'). After a decade of successful 'off-label' use, the efficacy and tolerability of Botox (total dose 20 biological units) in the treatment of glabellar frown lines have been demonstrated in two identical, large, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pivotal trials in a total of 537 subjects, mostly women, with moderate or severe glabellar lines during facial animation. Based both on subjects' and physicians' assessments, the improvement in glabellar lines with Botox was superior to that with placebo at each visit during the 120-day post-injection follow-up period, beginning on day 7 post-injection. The peak effect was seen on day 30 post-injection when 80% of subjects in the two studies combined had the severity of their lines at maximum frown reduced to mild or none, as assessed by their physician, and 89% had at least a moderate (>    or =50%) improvement in the appearance of their glabellar lines, as rated by themselves. In a noncomparative extension of these trials, there was a tendency for a higher proportion of subjects to respond to Botox injections after a second and third treatment session. Botox injections for glabellar lines are well tolerated. Headache, the most common adverse event, occurred with a similar frequency to placebo in the two pivotal studies (13% vs 18%). Temporary blepharoptosis occurred in 3.2% of Botox recipients; however, the incidence of this adverse event tended to decrease with repeated treatment sessions. In summary, Botox injections offer a convenient, effective, and well tolerated treatment for improving glabellar frown lines. Repeated injections are necessary to maintain a long-term effect; however, this technique clearly represents an attractive option for individuals who wish to avoid a more major procedure."

1201574	"Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) is considered a complex and multifactorial disease. Excessive histamine intake may induce an attack of urticaria. The main enzyme for histamine metabolism is diamine oxidase (DAO).                                                                                  Plasma histamine concentrations and DAO activities were evaluated to determine whether there are abnormalities in the histamine metabolism of CIU patients.                                                                              Seventy-five CIU patients and twenty-five healthy control subjects were included in the study. Blood was taken from all subjects to measure plasma levels of the histamine and DAO.                                                                              Mean plasma histamine levels were significantly higher in CIU patients (11.59±10.98 nM) than in the control subjects (8.75±2.55 nM) (p=0.04). Mean DAO activities were lower in patients of CIU (80.86±26.81 histamine degrading unit [HDU]/ml) than in the controls (81.60±9.67 HDU/ml), but without significant difference. In 15 CIU patients with gastrointestinal symptoms, the mean histamine concentration was higher (12.43±7.97 nM) and DAO activity was lower (77.93±27.53 HDU/ml) than in the remaining 60 CIU patients without gastrointestinal symptoms (11.38±11.67 nM and 81.58±26.82 HDU/ml), without significant difference. The relationship between DAO activity and plasma histamine concentrations showed a significant negative linear value (p=0.001). There were no significant relationships between plasma histamine concentrations and symptom severity score.                                                                                     In CIU patients, a high plasma histamine concentration may not be explained by DAO activity. CIU patients with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms showed no significantly lower DAO activity. Larger group studies are required to elucidate the relationship between plasma histamine concentrations and DAO activity, especially of CIU patients with GI symptomsto understand the difference in CIU patients with and without GI symptoms."
1979498	"The putative circulating factor responsible for the glomerular permeability alterations induced in vitro by serum from patients affected by focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) remains unidentified. We have observed that a serine proteinase isolated from patient serum increases albumin permeability in isolated glomeruli. The objective of the present study was to determine the effect of various proteinase inhibitors on glomerular albumin permeability (P(alb)) in isolated glomeruli incubated with FSGS serum.                                                                              The study population consisted of 12 FSGS patients (eight males; mean age: 21+/-10 years) previously shown to have elevated serum albumin permeability activity. P(alb) was determined by measuring the change in glomerular volume induced by applying oncotic gradients to isolated healthy rat glomeruli treated with patient serum in comparison to control serum. Solutions of seven different proteinase inhibitors (0.5 mg/ml) were added to the incubation media with the sera (1:1 vol/vol): serine proteinase inhibitors (PMSF, leupeptin, aprotinin, gabexate mesylate), the cysteine proteinase inhibitor E-64, the metalloproteinase inhibitor EDTA and the aspartate proteinase inhibitor pepstatin. Sera from the same patients were also tested with the addition to the incubation media of quinaprilat, an inhibitor of the metalloproteinase angiotensin-converting enzyme.                                                                              Mean P(alb) of the sera was 0.86+/-0.11, with the addition of PMSF 0.41+/-0.09, leupeptin 0.30+/-0.17, aprotinin 0.09+/-0.14, gabexate mesylate 0.27+/-0.25, E-64 0.81+/-0.09, EDTA 0.68+/-0.10 or pepstatin 0.76+/-0.11. The mean P(alb) of the sera combined with quinaprilat was reduced to 0.34+/-0.35. Thus, only the serine proteinase inhibitors consistently blocked the increased P(alb) induced by the FSGS sera.                                                                                      In the cascade of events that lead to the initiation of glomerular fibrosis in FSGS, the putative glomerular permeability factor associated with FSGS may require a serine proteinase to effect its activity."
6353011	"Disease control in anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) associated vasculitis (AAV) with immunosuppression is effective but burdened by adverse events, especially infections. The study goal was to evaluate risks and types of infections in patients with AAV.                                                                              Biopsy-proven AAV patients (diagnosed 1/1991-6/2011) followed in an inception cohort were evaluated for adverse events. Severe infections (requiring intravenous antibiotics, intensive care unit, or causing death) were recorded. Infection number was grouped as none, 1-2 or ≥3. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals.                                                                              A total of 489 patients (median age 59; 47% female, 55% myeloperoxidase-ANCA) were followed for 2.8 years (median). At 1, 2 and 5 years cumulative incidence of infection was 51, 58 and 65% and severe infection was 22, 23 and 26%. Pulmonary and upper respiratory infections were most common (42 and 30% ever experienced each, respectively), highest in the first 3 months. Staphylococcus aureus was most frequently seen among positive cultures (41%, 78 S. aureus/192 total positive cultures), and only one Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (6 weeks into treatment). All-cause death in 12 months was associated with infections (% deaths: 0 infections 3%; 1-2 infections 10%, ≥3 infections 13%, P = 0.002). Controlling for age, sex and kidney function, patients with severe infections were 4.2 times more likely to die within 12 months (95% CI 2.0-8.7; P = 0.001).                                                                                      More infections increase the risk of a severe infection which increases risk of all-cause mortality. Respiratory and S. aureus infections are dominant. Targeted prophylactic therapy could decrease morbidity."
8361674	"Aster pyrenaeus (Asteraceae) is an endangered species, endemic to the Pyrenees and Cantabrian Mountain ranges (Spain). For its long-term persistence, this taxon needs an appropriate conservation strategy to be implemented. In this context, we studied the genetic structure over the entire geographical range of the species and then inferred the genetic relationships between populations.                                                                                  Molecular diversity was analysed for 290 individuals from 12 populations in the Pyrenees and the Cantabrian Mountains using inter simple sequence repeats (ISSRs). Bayesian-based analysis was applied to examine population structure.                                                                                        Analysis of genetic similarity and diversity, based on 87 polymorphic ISSR markers, suggests that despite being small and isolated, populations have an intermediate genetic diversity level (P % = 52.8 %, H(E) = 0.21 ± 0.01, genetic similarity between individuals = 49.6 %). Genetic variation was mainly found within populations (80-84 %), independently of mountain ranges, whereas 16-18 % was found between populations and <   5 % between mountain ranges. Analyses of molecular variance indicated that population differentiation was highly significant. However, no significant correlation was found between the genetic and geographical distances among populations (Rs = 0.359, P = 0.140). Geographical structure based on assignment tests identified five different gene pools that were independent of any particular structure in the landscape.                                                                                      The results suggest that population isolation is probably relatively recent, and that the outbreeding behaviour of the species maintains a high within-population genetic diversity. We assume that some long-distance dispersal, even among topographically remote populations, may be determinant for the pattern of genetic variation found in populations. Based on these findings, strategies are proposed for genetic conservation and management of the species."
2166239	"We describe a 32-year-old patient with adult dermatomyositis who developed dyspnea and worsening of pre-existing infarcted skin lesions of the fingers. Chest radiographs showed diffuse hazy reticulonodular infiltration in both lungs, subcutaneous emphysema, pneumomediastinum, and pneumothorax. The pulmonary symptoms and cutaneous lesions gradually improved with a high dose of prednisolone. Although subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum occur frequently in association with traumatic disruption of cutaneous and mucosal barriers and assisted ventilation, it has rarely been observed in patients with interstitial pneumonitis in connective tissue diseases. Although dermatomyositis and subcutaneous emphysema are all relatively well-known diseases to dermatologists, the occurrence of spontaneous pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax and subsequent subcutaneous emphysema in connective tissue diseases such as dermatomyositis is unfamiliar. We discuss the possible mechanisms of this condition."
1271645	"A 41-year-old HIV positive woman was started on highly active antiretroviral therapy when her CD(4) count was 54/cu mm. Three weeks later, she developed erythematous to skin-colored plaques over the face. Investigations revealed a moderate eosinophilia, raised ESR, elevated 24-hour urinary calcium and hyperglobulinemia. Skin biopsy of the facial plaque revealed prominent epithelioid cell granulomas in the dermis. Reticulin stain showed reticulin fibers within the granulomas. Five months later, all the facial lesions regressed with continuation of HAART, with no specific treatment for facial plaques. Repeat CD(4) count was 104/cu mm. A diagnosis of cutaneous sarcoidosis occurring as a part of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome was made. Although systemic sarcoidosis has been reported, the occurrence of cutaneous sarcoidosis as part of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome has not been elucidated conclusively."
2334937	"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a well-known complication after liver transplantation (LT) and is associated with increased mortality. The purpose of this study was to determine risk factors of advanced CKD and mortality after LT.                                                                              Four hundred forty-five adult patients underwent LT between June 1990 and September 2007 and survived more than 1 month. Multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed for time to CKD stage 4 (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] ≤30 mL/min), time to chronic dialysis, and all-cause mortality. Several patient and disease characteristics were used as independent pre- and posttransplant variables. We specifically analyzed a drop more than or equal to 30% in the estimated GFR (eGFR) during the first year posttransplant.                                                                              Diabetes mellitus pretransplant and a drop more than or equal to 30% in the eGFR between 3 and 12 months predicted CKD stage 4 (odds ratio [OR] 4.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9-5.4, P<   0.001 and OR 16.1, 95% CI 5.9-44.5, P<   0.0001, respectively), the need for chronic dialysis (OR 3.8, 95% CI 1.1-13.2, P=0.03 and OR 14.6, 95% CI 3.0-71.4, P<   0.001, respectively), and all-cause mortality (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2-2.9, P=0.004 and OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.6-4.4, P<   0.001, respectively), more than 1 year after LT.                                                                                      Diabetes mellitus pretransplant and a drop more than or equal to 30% in the eGFR within the first year are strong predictors of advanced CKD, chronic dialysis, and death more than 1 year after LT. These easily determined clinical variables define a population at risk for CKD who should be targeted for renal protection strategies."

1499858	"We report an 85-year-old female patient who presented with an erythematous keratotic lesion on her temple suspicious of squamous cell carcinoma. Histological evaluation revealed actinic keratosis, but the underlying atypical infiltrate contained atypical myeloid forms consistent with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Upon further questioning, it was determined that the patient had a history of myelodysplastic syndrome. Her skin biopsy provided the first evidence of progression to AML. This case serves as an important reminder of the role the dermatopathologist plays in identifying serious systemic disease."
3471612	"Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) modulate plant development and growth and are important regulators of biotic and abiotic stress responses. Recently it was found that simultaneously silencing Nicotiana attenuata NaCDPK4 and NaCDPK5 (IRcdpk4/5 plants) results in accumulation of exceptionally high JA levels after wounding or simulated herbivory treatments, which in turn induced high levels of defense metabolites that slowed the growth of Manduca sexta, a specialist insect herbivore. To investigate the mechanism by which NaCDPK4 and NaCDPK5 regulate JA accumulation, we analyzed the transcript levels of all important enzymes involved in JA biosynthesis, but these genes showed no differences between wild-type and IRcdpk4/5 plants. Moreover, the dynamics of JA were similar between these plants, excluding the possibility of decreased degradation rates in IRcdpk4/5 plants. To gain insight into the mechanism by which NaCDPK4 and NaCDPK5 regulate JA biosynthesis, free fatty acids, including C18:3, and (9S,13S)-12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA), two important precursors of JA were quantified at different times before and after wounding and simulated herbivore feeding treatments. We show that after these treatments, IRcdpk4/5 plants have decreased levels of C18:3, but have enhanced OPDA and JA levels, suggesting that NaCDPK4 and NaCDPK5 have a role in the early steps of JA biosynthesis. The possible role of NaCDPK4 and NaCDPK5 regulating AOS and AOC enzymatic activity is discussed."
3017483	"Central line-associated blood stream infections (CLABSI) commonly complicate the care of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (HCT). We developed a modified CLABSI (MCLABSI) definition that attempts to exclude pathogens usually acquired because of disruption of mucosal barriers during the vulnerable neutropenic period following HCT that are generally included under the original definition (OCLABSI). We conducted a retrospective study of all AML and MDS patients undergoing HCT between August 2009 and December 2011 at the Cleveland Clinic (N = 73), identifying both OCLABSI and MCLABSI incidence. The median age at transplantation was 52 years (range, 16 to 70); 34 had a high (≥3) HCT comorbidity index (HCT-CI); 34 received bone marrow (BM), 24 received peripheral stem cells (PSC), and 15 received umbilical cord blood cells (UCB). Among these 73 patients, 23 (31.5%) developed OCLABSI, of whom 16 (69.6%) died, and 8 (11%) developed MCLABSI, of whom 7 (87.5%) died. OCLABSI was diagnosed a median of 9 days from HCT: 5 days (range, 2 to 12) for UCB and 78 days (range, 7 to 211) for BM/PSC (P <    .001). MCLABSI occurred a median of 12 days from HCT, with similar earlier UCB and later BM/PSC diagnosis (P = .030). Risk factors for OCLABSI in univariate analysis included CBC (P <    .001), human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatch (P = .005), low CD34(+) count (P = .007), low total nucleated cell dose (P = .016), and non-Caucasian race (P = .017). Risk factors for OCLABSI in multivariable analysis were UCB (P <    .001) and high HCT-CI (P = .002). There was a significant increase in mortality for both OCLABSI (hazard ratio, 7.14; CI, 3.31 to 15.37; P <    .001) and MCLABSI (hazard ratio, 6.44; CI, 2.28 to 18.18; P <    .001). CLABSI is common and associated with high mortality in AML and MDS patients undergoing HCT, especially in UCB recipients and those with high HCT-CI. We propose the MCLABSI definition to replace the OCLABSI definition, given its greater precision for identifying preventable infection in HCT patients."
9441574	"Numerous materials and techniques have been introduced to augment the maxillary sinus floor for future dental implant placement. Schneiderian membrane tenting above simultaneously placed implants proved to be a successful technique. The present study investigated the use of a titanium micromesh for lateral-window sinus floor elevation without bone grafting.                                                                                           Four patients indicated for two-stage sinus lifting were included. Through a lateral window, a titanium micromesh was tailored and placed into the sinus to maintain the elevated membrane in place. Immediate and 6-month postoperative cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) was performed to measure the gained bone height. During implant placement, bone core biopsies were retrieved for histomorphometry.                                                                              The average residual ridge height among the eight sinuses was 3.6 mm ± 1.6 mm. Six months postoperatively, it reached 9.63 mm ± 1.47 mm. Histomorphometry revealed that the average bone volume of the native bone was 30.3% ± 9.1%, while that of the newly formed bone was 55.3% ± 11.4%.                                                                                     Within the limitations of this study due to the small sample size, the use of the titanium micromesh as a space-maintaining device after schneiderian membrane elevation is a reliable technique to elevate the floor of the sinus without grafting."

We sought to document the characteristics and behavior of UPMCC, and determine the most appropriate treatment.                                                                              A multicenter, retrospective, consecutive study reviewing patients given a diagnosis of UPMCC between 1981 and 2008 was completed. In addition, a literature review of cases of UPMCC was performed.                                                                              In all, 23 patients with UPMCC are described and 34 cases from previous reports are compiled. Among the 23 new cases of UPMCC, the average age at diagnosis was 66.0 years; the majority of patients were male (87%) and Caucasian (100% of those reported). One patient was immunosuppressed, and 39% had a history of other cancer. After the initial biopsy, 16 patients had further evaluation of the involved lymph node basin. Half of these had additional positive nodes (8 of 16). The majority of patients had lymph node basin involvement only (78%), whereas 22% had lymph node basin and distant metastasis. The most common lymph node basin involved was inguinal. The median size of the involved lymph node at diagnosis was 5.0 cm. At 2 years, the overall survival of stage IIIB UPMCC was significantly improved versus stage IIIB known primary Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC): 76.9% to 36.4%.                                                                                      Limited number of cases and retrospective review are limitations.                                                                                     Our data demonstrate improved overall survival in patients with stage IIIB UPMCC versus those with stage IIIB known primary MCC. Because of the unpredictable natural history of UPMCC, we recommend individualization of care based on the details of each patient's clinical presentation."
1658643	"Naegeli-Franceschetti-Jadassohn syndrome (NFJS) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by loss of dermatoglyphics, reticulate hyperpigmentation of the skin, palmoplantar keratoderma, abnormal sweating, and other developmental anomalies of the teeth, hair, and skin. We recently demonstrated that NFJS is caused by heterozygous nonsense or frameshift mutations in the E1/V1-encoding region of KRT14, but the mechanisms for their deleterious effects in NFJS remain elusive. In this study, we further expand the spectrum of NFJS-causing mutations and demonstrate that these mutations result in haploinsufficiency for keratin 14 (K14). As increased apoptotic activity was observed in the epidermal basal cell layer in NFJS patients and as previous data suggested that type I keratins may confer resistance to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced apoptosis in epithelial tissues, we assessed the effect of down-regulation of KRT14 expression on apoptotic activity in keratinocytes. Using a HaCaT cell-based assay, we found that decreased KRT14 expression is associated with increased susceptibility to TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis. This phenomenon was not observed when cells were cultured in the presence of doxycycline, a known negative regulator of TNF-alpha-dependant pro-apoptotic signaling. Collectively, our results indicate that NFJS results from haploinsufficiency for K14 and suggest that increased susceptibility of keratinocytes to pro-apoptotic signals may be involved in the pathogenesis of this ectodermal dysplasia syndrome."
3238020	"The cruciferous plant Arabidopsis thaliana has two closely related, nonallelic tryptophan synthase beta genes (TSB1 and TSB2), each containing four introns and a chloroplast leader sequence. Both genes are transcribed, although TSB1 produces greater than 90% of tryptophan synthase beta mRNA in leaf tissue. A tryptophan-requiring mutant, trp2-1, has been identified that has about 10% of the wild-type tryptophan synthase beta activity. The trp2-1 mutation is complemented by the TSB1 transgene and is linked genetically to a polymorphism in the TSB1 gene, strongly suggesting that trp2-1 is a mutation in TSB1. The trp2-1 mutants are conditional: they require tryptophan for growth under standard illumination but not under very low light conditions. Presumably, under low light the poorly expressed gene, TSB2, is capable of supporting growth. Genetic redundancy may be common to many aromatic amino acid biosynthetic enzymes in plants because mutants defective in two other genes (TRP1 and TRP3) also exhibit a conditional tryptophan auxotrophy. The existence of two tryptophan pathways has important consequences for tissue-specific regulation of amino acid and secondary metabolite biosynthesis."
3159780	"We have investigated immunohistologically the cutaneous immune infiltrate in the lesions of five patients with severe, extensive lichen planus of recent onset before and after 15 days of oral, low-dose cyclosporine therapy (3 mg/kg/day). Before therapy, we observed an abnormal bandlike cellular infiltrate localized in the papillary dermis, composed mostly of CD3+ cells, with a prevalence of CD4+ cells. Infiltrating lymphocytes showed markers of activation (HLA-DR antigens and interleukin 2 receptor), and there were many Langerhans (CD1+) cells in the dermal infiltrate. After 15 days of cyclosporine therapy, we observed a dramatic decrease in the total number of T cells and a corresponding decrease in interleukin 2 receptor-positive activated CD25+ cells and in antigen-presenting cells (CD1+ and CD14b+). These changes were concurrent with clinical improvement. Our results are compatible with the hypothesis that the inhibition of CD4 T cells by cyclosporine might explain the drug's therapeutic action and that the interaction between antigen-presenting cells and CD4 T cells is important in the pathogenesis of lichen planus."
5333437	"Currently, the scale and consistency of changes of gene expression profiles in models of melanoma progression are largely unknown. Therefore, we investigated siblings of cell lines or malignant melanomas (MM), which have been selected by nude mouse passages for (a). increased tumorigenicity (local ECM-independent growth), (b). metastatic potential, or (c). selected for increase invasiveness using the Boyden chamber. cDNA array analysis surveying more than 27.000 transcripts per cell line showed that 1.5-2.8% of all detectable transcripts were consistently differentially regulated during selection process in those models. Using array analysis, we identified 33 individual transcripts that exhibited significant differential hybridization paralleling the increased aggressiveness of the selected progeny. Because some of those genes could play a significant functional role in the progression of MM, we additionally proved their regulative pattern using Northern blotting. Among others, progressive overexpression of osteonectin/SPARC, a angiogenesis, was found in the selected offspring from all three experimental models and may therefore be considered as a potential marker for aggressive MM as well a promising therapeutic target. We further show that the selection of MM cells for increased ECM-independent local growth was accompanied by overexpresssion of macrophage migration inhibiting factor (MIF), an important modulator of both cell cycle progression and angiogenesis, and cathepsin Z, a novel member of the family of matrix degrading proteinases."

1830812	"Claudins (Cldn) are the major components of tight junctions (TJs) sealing the paracellular cleft in tissue barriers of various organs. Zebrafish Cldnb, the homolog of mammalian Cldn4, is expressed at epithelial cell-cell contacts and is important for regulating epidermal permeability. The bacterial toxin Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) has been shown to bind to a subset of mammalian Cldns. In this study, we used the Cldn-binding C-terminal domain of CPE (194-319 amino acids, cCPE 194-319 ) to investigate its functional role in modulating zebrafish larval epidermal barriers. In vitro analyses show that cCPE 194-319 removed Cldn4 from epithelial cells and disrupted the monolayer tightness, which could be rescued by the removal of cCPE 194-319. Incubation of zebrafish larvae with cCPE 194-319 removed Cldnb specifically from the epidermal cell membrane. Dye diffusion analysis with 4-kDa fluorescent dextran indicated that the permeability of the epidermal barrier increased due to cCPE 194-319 incubation. Electron microscopic investigation revealed reversible loss of TJ integrity by Cldnb removal. Collectively, these results suggest that cCPE 194-319 could be used as a Cldnb modulator to transiently open the epidermal barrier in zebrafish. In addition, zebrafish might be used as an in vivo system to investigate the capability of cCPE to enhance drug delivery across tissue barriers."
9447564	"Histoid leprosy is a rare form of multibacillary leprosy with distinct clinical and histopathological features. It is a variant of lepromatous leprosy with a very high bacillary load. It appears in patients as relapse after dapsone monotherapy and resistance or rarely, ""de novo."" Although leprosy is slowly declining the exact mode of transmission is unclear. At least until recently, the most widely held belief was that the disease was transmitted by contact between cases of leprosy and healthy persons. Transmission by the respiratory route is also gaining ground. There are other possibilities such as transmission through insects, which cannot be completely ruled out. However, the present case report possibly suggests the role of skin as a portal of both exit and entry for the bacillus in histoid leprosy transmission. De novo form of histoid leprosy has numerous solid staining bacteria inside the epidermis. The reports show that these bacilli can be eliminated from the intact epidermis, which indicate an unusual role of the skin in the transmission of leprosy."
7402399	"Cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNGCs) form non-selective cation entry pathways regulated by calmodulin (CaM), a universal Ca(2+) sensor in eukaryotes. Although CaM binding has been shown to be important for Ca(2+)-dependent feedback regulation of CNGC activity, the CaM-binding properties of these channels have been investigated in a few cases only. We show that CNGC20 from Arabidopsis thaliana binds CaM in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner and interacts with all AtCaM isoforms but not with the CaM-like proteins CML8 and CML9. CaM interaction with the full-length channel was demonstrated in planta, using bimolecular fluorescence complementation. This interaction occurred at the plasma membrane, in accordance with our localization data of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused CNGC20 proteins. The CaM-binding site was mapped to an isoleucine glutamine (IQ) motif, which has not been characterized in plant CNGCs so far. Our results show that compared with the overlapping binding sites for cyclic nucleotides and CaM in CNGCs studied so far, they are sequentially organized in CNGC20. The presence of two alternative CaM-binding modes indicates that ligand regulation of plant CNGCs is more complex than previously expected. Since the IQ domain is conserved among plant CNGCs, this domain adds to the variability of Ca(2+)-dependent channel control mechanisms underlining the functional diversity within this multigene family."
2283838	"In vivo examination of the skin by reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) has been performed for about 20 years, leading to a broad spectrum of imaged infectious and inflammatory skin diseases (ISD) with many described RCM features. We systematically reviewed all available literature concerning ISD evaluated by RCM. Furthermore, we assessed the accuracy of the features and defined recommendations for future studies after indicating the limitations in the current published literature. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases were searched for literature. All studies on RCM and ISD were reviewed and quality assessment was determined by using the STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) checklist. The literature search revealed 77 eligible studies for inclusion. Different RCM features in a broad spectrum of ISD have been described. Further, RCM has been used for monitoring treatment and evolution of ISD, as well as for diagnostic purposes. This systematic review provides an overview of the broad spectrum of ISD imaged by RCM. Although RCM seems to be a promising monitoring and diagnostic tool for ISD, studies with appropriate methodological quality are necessary to create adequate guidelines and protocols for further implementation of RCM in clinical practice."
4566968	"Hemodynamic deterioration resulting from brain death-induced myocardial left ventricular dysfunction may preclude heart donation. A reduced myocardial high-energy phosphate content, assessed by biopsy specimens, has been suggested to be responsible for this phenomenon. By applying phosphorus 31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy, in vivo myocardial high-energy phosphate metabolism can be studied continuously.                                                                              Twelve cats were sedated, intubated, ventilated, and studied for 240 minutes. Heart rate, arterial blood pressure, and arterial blood gases were monitored. Central venous pressure was kept constant. Myocardial work was expressed as rate-pressure product (RPP=heart rate x systolic arterial blood pressure). After sternotomy a radio frequency surface coil was positioned onto the left ventricle. A parietal trephine hole was drilled, and an inflatable balloon was inserted. The animal was placed into a 4.7 T horizontal 40 cm bore magnet interfaced to a spectrometer. Brain death (n=6) was induced by rapid inflation of the balloon; the six other cats served as a sham-operated control group. 31P spectra were obtained in 30 seconds, with ventilation and arterial blood pressure curve triggering. The phosphocreatine/to/adenosine triphosphate ratio, as an estimator of energy metabolism, was calculated.                                                                              Brain death was established within 30 seconds after inflation of the balloon. Changes in RPP were characterized by a triphasic profile with a maximum increase from 19.3+/-1.4 x 10(3) to 87.5+/-8.1 x 10(3) mm Hg x min(-1) (p <    .0001 vs control group) at 2 minutes after inflation of the balloon. Subsequently, RPP decreased and was normalized at 15 minutes after inflation. The third phase was characterized by hemodynamic deterioration, which became significant at 180 minutes and resulted in mean arterial pressure of 71+/-12 mm Hg (p <    .05 vs control group) at the end of the experimental period. RPP deteriorated to 14.6+/-2.0 x 10(3) mm Hg x min(-1) (p <    .05 vs control group) at 240 minutes. Because the heart rate remained constant during the third phase, the decrease in RPP was caused by a decrease in systolic arterial blood pressure. The initial phosphocreatine/adenosine triphosphate ratio of 1.65+/-0.16 varied to 1.52+/-0.06 at 2 minutes, and to 1.73 +/-0.17 (all values NS vs control group and vs initial ratio) at 240 minutes.                                                                                      The energy status of the heart is not affected by brain death. Therefore brain death-induced hemodynamic deterioration is not caused by impaired myocardial high-energy phosphate metabolism."

1794847	"The aim of this review is to provide an overview of significance of T helper 17 (Th17) immunity in acute, chronic and antibody-mediated allograft rejection. The role of Th17 immunity in development of de-novo autoimmunity following transplantation is outlined. It will also consider the impact of Th17 immunity on transplantation tolerance. Potential therapies to target Th17 immunity are discussed.                                                                                      Interleukin17 (IL-17) is produced by a wide variety of immune and non-immune cells in response to injury. IL-17 production by tubular epithelial cells in response to complement activation in acute antibody-mediated rejection may perpetuate immune injury. Th17-dependent de-novo autoimmunity contributes to chronic allograft rejection. Targeting IL-17 not only inhibits Th17 immunity but also attenuates Th1 immunity by affecting the initial recruitment of immune cells to sites of inflammation and modulates innate and adaptive immune responses that ultimately lead to tissue destruction.                                                                                  Th17 immunity is now beginning to be appreciated as a set of responses mediated not only by CD4 Th17 cells but a variety of immune cells and a plethora of cytokines that collaborate to mediate immune disorders, including transplant rejection. Development and contribution of de-novo autoimmunity to chronic rejection is increasingly appreciated. The developmental plasticity of Tregs and Th17 cells is a major hurdle to Treg-based cellular therapies for transplantation. Several biologics targeting Th17 immunity are under evaluation for autoimmune disease. It remains to be determined whether these can be used in transplantation to improve outcomes."
3256921	"The outcome for 39 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in remission who had CAMPATH 1M T cell-depleted unrelated donor bone marrow transplantations (BMTs) is described. Conditioning was mainly with cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) and total body irradiation (TBI) (14.4 Gy), but 5 patients received busulfan in place of TBI and 200 mg/kg cyclophosphamide. All patients received cyclosporin, and short-course methotrexate was given to recipients of mismatched grafts. The patient population was predominantly pediatric (median age, 10 years), but one third of the patients was aged 15 years or above. Twenty-five patients were in second complete remission (CR2), and 14 had high-risk CR1 disease (primarily failed remission induction or antecedent myelodysplastic syndrome, often with complex cytogenetic abnormalities). Both recipient and donor were cytomegalovirus seronegative in 15 of 37 cases (38%); 51% of patients were matched for HLA class I and II. Grade II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurred in 24% of patients; chronic GVHD occurred in 5 of 31 evaluable patients (16%), 4 extensive and 1 limited. Relapse occurred in 5 cases (13%); 1 of these 5 patients survives, 24 months after a second unrelated donor transplantation. Two of these relapses were associated with secondary graft failure (incidence rate, 5%). All patients engrafted primarily. Severe viral infection was the major transplant-associated complication, with 12 episodes in 9 patients, 5 of them lethal. Twenty-five patients survive at a median follow-up of 44 months (range, 2-102 months), with estimated actuarial overall and disease-free survival rates at 44 months of 61% (SE 8%) and 57% (SE 8%), respectively. Nineteen patients are more than 2 years post-BMT and may be cured. The functional status of long-term survivors is excellent, with 19 of 21 patients who survive 6 months or more in full-time employment or full-time students. These encouraging results suggest that in patients lacking a sibling donor, unrelated donor BMT for AML in remission achieves survival figures as good as or better than those reported on patients with autologous stem cell transplantation, and that T-cell depletion of grafts is associated with a low relapse rate and an excellent functional status. However, only a randomized study comparing unrelated donor BMT and auto-grafting will resolve which of these treatment strategies is better for patients with AML."
1956818	"Assembly of stable light-harvesting complexes (LHCs) in the chloroplast of green algae and plants requires synthesis of chlorophyll (Chl) b, a reaction that involves oxygenation of the 7-methyl group of Chl a to a formyl group. This reaction uses molecular oxygen and is catalyzed by chlorophyllide a oxygenase (CAO). The amino acid sequence of CAO predicts mononuclear iron and Rieske iron-sulfur centers in the protein. The mechanism of synthesis of Chl b and localization of this reaction in the chloroplast are essential steps toward understanding LHC assembly.                                                                              Fluorescence of a CAO-GFP fusion protein, transiently expressed in young pea leaves, was found at the periphery of mature chloroplasts and on thylakoid membranes by confocal fluorescence microscopy. However, when membranes from partially degreened cells of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cw15 were resolved on sucrose gradients, full-length CAO was detected by immunoblot analysis only on the chloroplast envelope inner membrane. The electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum of CAO included a resonance at g = 4.3, assigned to the predicted mononuclear iron center. Instead of a spectrum of the predicted Rieske iron-sulfur center, a nearly symmetrical, approximately 100 Gauss peak-to-trough signal was observed at g = 2.057, with a sensitivity to temperature characteristic of an iron-sulfur center. A remarkably stable radical in the protein was revealed by an isotropic, 9 Gauss peak-to-trough signal at g = 2.0042. Fragmentation of the protein after incorporation of 125I- identified a conserved tyrosine residue (Tyr-422 in Chlamydomonas and Tyr-518 in Arabidopsis) as the radical species. The radical was quenched by chlorophyll a, an indication that it may be involved in the enzymatic reaction.                                                                                     CAO was found on the chloroplast envelope and thylakoid membranes in mature chloroplasts but only on the envelope inner membrane in dark-grown C. reinhardtii cells. Such localization provides further support for the envelope membranes as the initial site of Chl b synthesis and assembly of LHCs during chloroplast development. Identification of a tyrosine radical in the protein provides insight into the mechanism of Chl b synthesis."

We sought to compare the clinical features and outcomes of patients with Darier disease who developed KVE superinfection with those who did not.                                                                              A 20-year retrospective analysis of 79 patients with Darier disease treated at our institution was performed.                                                                              Eleven (14%) patients developed KVE, of whom 45% required hospitalization for their skin disease during the follow-up period. Patients with KVE had more severe Darier disease (P = .030) and were more likely to be hospitalized (P = .015). HSV was detected in erosions without concomitant vesicles or pustules in 64% of confirmed cases. In all, 23 (55%) patients with erosions had HSV testing pursued.                                                                                      Retrospective study design is a limitation.                                                                                     The majority of KVE occurs in painless or painful erosions that may also appear impetiginized without vesicle or pustule formation. As HSV superinfection is correlated with severe Darier disease and risk for hospitalization, increased recognition of this phenomenon may lead to better patient outcomes."
7799054	"Western redcedar (WRC; Thuja plicata) produces high amounts of oxygenated thujone monoterpenoids associated with resistance against herbivore feeding, particularly ungulate browsing. Thujones and other monoterpenoids accumulate in glandular structures in the foliage of WRC. Thujones are produced from (+)-sabinene by sabinol and sabinone. Using metabolite analysis, enzyme assays with WRC tissue extracts, cloning, and functional characterization of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, we established that trans-sabin-3-ol but not cis-sabin-3-ol is the intermediate in thujone biosynthesis in WRC. Based on transcriptome analysis, full-length complementary DNA cloning, and characterization of expressed P450 proteins, we identified CYP750B1 and CYP76AA25 as the enzymes that catalyze the hydroxylation of (+)-sabinene to trans-sabin-3-ol. Gene-specific transcript analysis in contrasting WRC genotypes producing high and low amounts of monoterpenoids, including a glandless low-terpenoid clone, as well as assays for substrate specificity supported a biological role of CYP750B1 in α- and β-thujone biosynthesis. This P450 belongs to the apparently gymnosperm-specific CYP750 family and is, to our knowledge, the first member of this family to be functionally characterized. In contrast, CYP76AA25 has a broader substrate spectrum, also converting the sesquiterpene farnesene and the herbicide isoproturon, and its transcript profiles are not well correlated with thujone accumulation."
1203683	"Human erythema multiforme (EM) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) are separate conditions. There is no consensus on classification criteria for the eponymous diseases in animals.                                                                              Animal EM is very different from 90% of human EM, which is herpes virus associated (HAEM). Animals lack acrally distributed, typical raised targets. Unlike canine parvovirus 'EM', HAEM is not an active infection. Animal EM is often attributed to drugs, but this is rarely proved. Conversely, human and animal SJS/TEN are almost identical, life-threatening disorders of epidermal necrosis and detachment, typically triggered by drugs (occasionally by infectious agents). Both EM and SJS/TEN are mediated by cytotoxic lymphocyte responses against altered keratinocytes (infectious agents or drugs). Apoptosis results from direct cytotoxicity or through soluble mediators, namely Fas ligand, granzymes, perforin and granulysin. Diagnosis in humans is clinicopathological, with emphasis on clinical lesions; histopathology confirms the pathological process as interface (cytotoxic) dermatitis. Human EM is self-limiting; only recurrent and rare persistent cases require antiviral/immunosuppressive therapies. Drug-induced EM responds to drug withdrawal. Idiopathic canine EM (>   40%) is usually chronic, refractory to treatment and may represent heterogeneous conditions. Early identification and removal of the causative drug and high-quality supportive care are critical in SJS/TEN. Mortality rate is nevertheless high.                                                                                                              (1) Histopathological lesions do not reliably differentiate EM, SJS and TEN. (2) A multicentre study to develop a consensus set of clinical criteria for EM and SJS/TEN in animals is overdue. (3) No adjunctive therapies, including intravenous immunoglobulin and ciclosporin, have met evidence-based standards."
8991035	"Autoantibodies against thyroid hormones (THAbs) directed towards triiodothyronine (T3-Ab) and/or thyroxine (T4-Ab) are very rare in the general population. They are increased in some nonthyroidal autoimmune diseases, where they seem to predict autoimmune thyroid disorders (ATDs). So far, their presence in patients with vitiligo has not been evaluated, but it might have a possible predictive role.                                                                                   To assess the prevalence of THAbs in a group of vitiligo patients and to correlate their presence with clinical and historical parameters.                                                                              In total 79 patients with nonsegmental vitiligo and 100 controls were examined. Clinical characteristics of vitiligo and family and personal medical history were evaluated. Antinuclear autoantibodies, thyroid hormones and thyroid autoantibodies were measured. IgM T3-Ab, IgG T3-Ab, IgM T4-Ab and IgG T4-Ab were assayed by a radioimmunoprecipitation technique. Fisher's test, Student's t-test and χ(2)-test were used for statistical analysis.                                                                              Overall 77 of 79 patients (97%) had at least one type of THAb (11 T3-Ab, 10 T4-Ab, 56 both). In the control group, only one person (1%) had THAbs. In patients with vitiligo, T3-Abs were significantly associated with leucotrichia (IgM+IgG, P = 0.033; IgG, P = 0.039; IgM, P = 0.005) and thyroglobulin autoantibodies (IgM+IgG, P = 0.031; IgG, P = 0.058), while the absence of T3-Ab was related to personal history of cancer (IgM+IgG, P = 0.021; IgG, P = 0.039). T4-Abs were significantly associated with vitiligo activity (IgM+IgG, P <    0.001; IgM, P = 0.037) and duration (IgG, P = 0.013).                                                                                      The surprisingly high prevalence of THAb in patients with vitiligo and their associations suggest a possible pathogenetic role in the disease and stress the tight link between vitiligo and ATDs. Further evaluation in a larger group of patients and an adequate follow-up are needed to define their potential predictive role."
7772793	"Heart transplant patients are reported to have impaired regulation of the microvasculature. The purpose of this study was to investigate the cutaneous blood flow and its reactivity to sodium nitroprusside (vasodilator, Nipride 0.1%) and norepinephrine (vasoconstrictor, Levophed 0.1%) in patients after heart transplantation in comparison to normal healthy individuals. Eighteen patients after heart transplantation and 16 healthy, nonsmoking individuals served as subjects of the study. Sodium nitroprusside and norepinephrine were introduced by iontophoresis to the skin of the right and left forearms, respectively. After measuring cutaneous blood flow reactivity in the pre-exercise state by laser Doppler flowmetry, subjects were then asked to close and open their fists for 2 min. The same measurements were repeated after exercise. Comparisons between the groups were carried out by the Wilcoxan signed rank test. The Mann Whitney U-test was used for comparison between pre-exercise and post-exercise states. The results demonstrated that sodium nitroprusside significantly increased forearm cutaneous perfusion at rest but produced only a mild increase after exercise. This reactivity was significantly lower after exercise with no significant differences between groups. Norepinephrine decreased cutaneous blood flow at rest. The transplant patients were significantly less sensitive to norepinephrine before but not after exercise. The changes in norepinephrine reactivity with exercise were significantly different between groups (p <    0.05)."
4546366	"Tuberous sclerosis, an autosomal dominant disorder associated with hamartomas in multiple organs, prominently affects the central nervous system; principle lesions include subependymal nodules and giant cell astrocytomas, white matter heterotopias, and cortical tubers. Histologic, immunocytochemical, and ultrastructural features of these processes suggest they have their basis in abnormal cell migration and differentiation. Aberrant expression of cystoskeletal proteins appears to be common to the multisystem hamartomas of this disorder and may, in part, underlie their pathogenesis."
1669582	"Heterotrimeric G-proteins comprised of Gα, Gβ and Gγ subunits are important signal transducers in all eukaryotes. In plants, G-proteins affect multiple biotic and abiotic stress responses, as well as many developmental processes, even though their repertoire is significantly limited compared with that in metazoan systems. One canonical and three extra-large Gα, 1 Gβ and 3 Gγ proteins represent the heterotrimeric G-protein complex in Arabidopsis, and a single regulatory protein, RGS1, is one of the few known biochemical regulators of this signaling complex. This quantitative disparity between the number of signaling components and the range of processes they influence is rather intriguing. We now present evidence that the phospholipase Dα1 protein is a key component and modulator of the G-protein complex in affecting a subset of signaling pathways. We also show that the same G-protein subunits and their modulators exhibit distinct physiological and genetic interactions depending on specific signaling and developmental pathways. Such developmental plasticity and interaction specificity likely compensates for the lack of multiplicity of individual subunits, and helps to fine tune the plants' responses to constantly changing environments."
8231111	"The major programs of gene expression during late embryogenesis are the muturation or reserve accumulation program and, after ovule abscission, the postabscission program that is composed largely of Lea and LeaA mRNAs that probably encode desiccation protectants. There are diverse opinions about the developmental regulators of these programs. Several candidates are evaluated here by measuring, in cultured embryos, the accumulation kinetics of cloned mRNAs specifically expressed in the normal maturation, postabscission, or germination programs of cotton. Maturation-stage embryos both terminate the maturation program and induce the postabscission program after excision and culture, just as they do later in the plant after ovule abscission. However, they also induce simultaneously the germination program and are thus different from any normal stage of embryo development or germination. The developmental induction of the postabscission program in culture does not require exogenous abscisic acid, but its expression is enhanced by precocious desiccation or culture on abscisic acid or high osmoticum, probably by an environmentally responsive mechanism that normally operates during germination. Normal desiccation does not control any of these programs because the embryo acquires all of the characteristics of a mature embryo before it desiccates. These and other results suggest regulation of normal embryogenesis by a maternal maturation factor, a postabscission factor, and the postabscission program."
6097198	"MSUD is a hereditary metabolic disorder that is characterized by impaired activity of the BCKADC. Liver transplantation has been approved as a treatment for some MSUD cases in which the control of BCAAs is insufficient. Although there have been several reports about DDLT for MSUD, few LDLT cases have been reported. Because either of parents who are heterozygote of this disease usually applies to be a candidate of donor in LDLT, the impairment of BCKADC activity of graft liver should be concerned. We performed LDLT for 10 month-old girl with a left lateral segment graft from her father. BCKADC activities of the patient and her parents were measured using lysates of lymphocytes isolated from peripheral blood specimen before the transplant. As a consequence, the activity of BCKADC of father was not inferior to a normal range. The patient tolerated the operation well. Postoperative course was uneventful and mixed milk was started at 8th POD. The serum BCAAs levels have remained within normal range. It should be necessary to follow the physical growth and mental development of the recipient in the future."
3317960	"Despite its prominence as a concern among potential surgical candidates, there is little information in the literature regarding the short- and long-term pain experience after living liver donation. We undertook a prospective study to examine (1) the nature and incidence of acute and chronic pain after living donor hepatectomy and (2) the factors associated with an increased or decreased risk of adverse pain outcomes. Before donation, a comprehensive assessment of potential predictors of acute and chronic pain outcomes was conducted; this included donors' pain expectations, psychosocial factors, medical histories, and demographic factors. Detailed data regarding pain outcomes were collected postoperatively (days 1 and 2) and again during 6- and 12-month follow-up telephone interviews. Sixty-five adults (32 females and 33 males) scheduled for donor hepatectomy participated. Substantial proportions of the donors reported a moderate-to-severe level of pain intensity (≥4 on a 0-10 scale) at rest and after movement on day 1 (42% and 74%, respectively) and day 2 (33% and 32%, respectively). Persistent postsurgical pain was reported by 31% of the donors at the 6-month follow-up and by 27% of the donors at the 12-month follow-up. Generally, this pain was mild, and pain-related life interference was minimal. Female sex, a younger age, and several predonation measures of pain-related anxiety were associated with a significantly greater risk of developing persistent postsurgical pain. In conclusion, this study has identified a subset of patients who experience persistent pain after living liver donation. Additional prospective research using larger samples of liver donors is needed to replicate this work, to obtain a more detailed account of the acute and long-term pain experience, and to determine whether targeted interventions can minimize the frequency and severity of chronic pain."
3329473	"Mitochondrial respiratory chain disorders can cause acute liver failure in infants and children. Liver transplantation, however, has rarely been indicated for patients with mitochondrial respiratory chain disorders, because of the extrahepatic involvement. Herein we reported a case of acute liver failure with mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III deficiency treated by liver transplantation. At 2 years after transplantation, there were no extrahepatic manifestations. We suggest that mitochondrial disorders should be considered to be a cause of liver failure in infancy and that liver transplantation can be a life-saving treatment."
1581764	"In the mouse, allergic contact dermatitis to the strong contact allergen dinitrofluorobenzene is maximal 5 to 6 days after sensitization and rapidly fades in the succeeding days. It has been proposed that this loss of T-cell reactivity depends on feedback inhibition by anti-idiotypic antibody of the expression of allergic contact dermatitis. We have examined this question by studying the course of allergic contact dermatitis in mice made B-cell deficient by the chronic administration from birth of a heterologous antibody with specificity for mouse IgM. We found in these mice a spontaneous loss of allergic contact dermatitis comparable to that seen in normal intact mice. This implies that the rapid rise and fall of contact sensitivity in the mouse is not necessarily mediated by B cells (or B-cell products) and is compatible with its control, at least in part, by T-suppressor cells."
9440226	"Polyene n-3 and n-6 fatty acids are claimed to have immunomodulating properties. The impact of nutritional variations on transplant rejection was therefore studied in the heterotopic rat heart allotransplant model with particular focus on lipids. Twenty per cent fat emulsions with differing n-3/n-6 fatty acid ratios were continuously infused (9 g fat per kg bodyweight per day; n = 10 in each group) after transplantation until rejection: safflower oil (n-3/n-6 = 1/370), fish oil (7.6/1), soybean oil (1/6.5) and a 1:1 mixture of safflower and fish oil (1/2.1; oil control group). Graft survival time, subpopulations of infiltrating and circulating immunocompetent cells and interleukin-6 release by circulating mononuclear cells were analysed. In the safflower oil, fish oil and soybean oil groups graft survival was prolonged to 13.3, 12.3 and 10.4 days vs. 6.7 days in the oil control group and 7.8 days in the saline control group (p <    0.01). In the two groups with the highest prolongation of graft survival the number of infiltrating cells was reduced by up to 50% and the peripheral blood mononuclear cell interleukin-6 release by up to 45%. Beyond that, circulating T-cells were reduced in the fish oil group. The n-3/n-6 fatty acid ratio determines the immunomodulating effect of lipids. Both n-6 and n-3 fatty acids, if applied as the main fatty acid source, exert immunosuppressive effects by diminished infiltration, mobilization and cytokine release by immunocompetent cells. A n-3/n-6 fatty acid ratio of 1/2 proved to be immunologically neutral. The recipient's disposition to reject an allotransplant is influenced by the fatty acid composition of exogenously supplied lipids."
1525068	"Sodium benzoate (E 211) is widely used to delay yeast spoilage of acidic foods and beverages. Numerous cases of adverse reactions to benzoate have been recorded, but most of the studies that have been conducted lacked proper placebo controls or blinding.                                                                                  The aim of this study is to determine the incidence of intolerance to sodium benzoate among subjects who experienced repeated episodes of acute urticaria/angio-oedema following the ingestion of a meal or a product containing this substance.                                                                              This was a retrospective study based on the analysis of data from patients reported to have experienced episodes of urticaria, with or without angio-oedema, after ingesting meals or products containing sodium benzoate. At the first visit to the outpatients clinic, a careful history was taken. Patients were then given the following diagnostic tests: tests for IgE for common inhalant allergens and food allergens, and a double-blind, placebo-controlled challenge with sodium benzoate.                                                                              A total of 47 subjects were enrolled in the study; five (11%) showed at least one relevant positive reaction to an IgE test for food allergy. Only one subject (2%) had a reaction after the ingestion of 75 mg of sodium benzoate without an adverse reaction to placebo.                                                                                     This study shows that the percentage of repeated episodes of acute urticaria/angio-oedema reactions induced by sodium benzoate is very low (2%). In view of our results, we suggest that when faced with patients who have suffered adverse reactions that could be attributed to sodium benzoate, physicians should also carefully evaluate other possible causes."
7479301	"Protein energy malnutrition (PEM), the most widespread nutritional deficiency disorder of mankind, is a group of related disorders, with a more complex and still incompletely understood etiologic basis than its name suggests. Dermatologic and other clinical manifestations are more florid and characteristic in kwashiorkor than in marasmus. The complex of clinical syndromes that constitute PEM is best considered when using a three-dimensional model to illustrate its varying degrees (ie, mild, moderate, or severe) and the spectrumlike nature of the forms of the severe degree (ie, kwashiorkor, marasmic-kwashiorkor, or marasmus). Protein energy malnutrition is not confined to children in the Third World and is the most common form of undernutrition in hospitalized patients in Western countries. Marasmus is by far the most prevalent form. Much of the nutritional support given in hospitals is not based on an assessment of nutritional status, and little attention is paid to the different forms PEM might take. Even those who do consider this last point confuse hypoalbuminemia in patients acutely stressed or infected with kwashiorkor. Recent evidence suggests that the skin changes of kwashiorkor may be caused by zinc deficiency. Almost nothing is known about the histopathology of the skin per se in PEM but studies of the hair bulb have shown important differences among patients with kwashiorkor, marasmus, and normal skin."
1498247	"There is a documented association between diffuse planar xanthoma and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Previous accounts have hypothesized that patients with multiple lesions or extensive cutaneous disease are more likely to have an underlying abnormality of the reticuloendothelial system. However, we document a 62-year-old woman with a large pruritic yellow-orange plaque on the chest and lower anterior neck consistent with planar xanthoma that was discovered to have chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Solitary large plaques of planar xanthoma should be considered in the same fashion as diffuse planar xanthoma and warrant a prompt hematologic evaluation."
1008730	"The performance of the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) and delta-MELD scores in predicting posttransplant survival has been variable and the results are conflicting, suggesting that posttransplantational factors are more important than pre- or peritransplantational factors in outcomes following liver transplantation (OLT). We assessed the value of posttransplant MELD and delta-MELD scores to predict short-term (90-day) posttransplant survival. We evaluated 279 consecutive patients undergoing living donor OLTs. The MELD scores were calculated serially from pretransplantation as well as 3, 7, and 14 days after transplantation. Twenty-seven (9.7%) among 279 patients died within 90 days after transplantation. Pretransplant MELD score was not associated with short-term posttransplant mortality. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve in predicting 90-day mortality was 0.637 for posttransplant 3-day MELD, 0.746 for posttransplant 7-day MELD, and 0.859 for posttransplant 14-day MELD score (P = .047, <   .001, and <   .001, respectively); AUROC was 0.582, 0.646, and 0.784 for 3-day, 7-day, and 14-day delta-MELD scores (P = .235, .034, <   .001, respectively). Upon multivariate analysis, posttransplant 14-day MELD (>    or =20 vs <   20), and 14-day delta-MELD scores (>    or =-3 vs <   -3) were independent short-term prognostic factors with risk ratios of 18.875 (95% confidential interval [CI]: 4.625-77.028, P <    .001) and 13.577 (95% CI: 2.641-69.791, P = .002), respectively. In conclusion, determination of posttransplant 14-day MELD and 14-day delta-MELD scores may afford suitable short-term prognostic predictors for patients following living donor OLT."
5760791	"When left untreated, psoriasis and rosacea can have long-term health and psychosocial implications. The purpose of this study was to estimate the percentage of Americans with psoriasis or rosacea who are not being treated. Patient data from a large claims-based database were analyzed to identify the number of patients who are treated for psoriasis or rosacea. The numbers of patients treated were compared to the estimated prevalences of these diseases in the general population, identified from previously published sources. Of the 18,632,362 patients in the database, 140,439 (0.75%) were seen for psoriasis and 165,130 (0.89%) were seen for rosacea. Based on published sources, 3.2% of Americans have psoriasis and about 5.0% have rosacea. We therefore estimated that 77% of people with psoriasis and 82% of people with rosacea are untreated. Greater awareness, resources, and community outreach projects are potential tools that could eliminate this disparity and increase the quality of life for patients with these diseases."

Both financial and nonfinancial conflicts of interest may influence the reporting and evaluation of medical research. This should not hinder scientific cooperation between academic and industry-affiliated researchers. In the name of transparency, scientific journals should disclose the identity of a paper's peer reviewers and publish more information on the authors."
3955751	"Although clinical studies have yet to demonstrate clearly the use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) for prevention of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), their effective use in a xenogeneic mouse model has been demonstrated. We aimed to determine the mechanism of action by which IVIG contributes to GVHD prevention in a xenogeneic mouse model. NOD/LtSz-scidIL2rg(-/-) (NSG) mice were used for our xenogeneic mouse model of GVHD. Sublethally irradiated NSG mice were injected with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (huPBMCs) and treated weekly with PBS or 50 mg IVIG. Incidence of GVHD and survival were noted, along with analysis of cell subsets proliferation in the peripheral blood. Weekly IVIG treatment resulted in a robust and consistent proliferation of human natural killer cells that were activated, as demonstrated by their cytotoxicity against K562 target cells. IVIG treatment did not inhibit GVHD when huPBMCs were depleted in natural killer (NK) cells, strongly suggesting that this NK cell expansion was required for the IVIG-mediated prevention of GVHD in our mouse model. Moreover, inhibition of T cell activation by either cyclosporine A (CsA) or monoclonal antihuman CD3 antibodies abolished the IVIG-induced NK cell expansion. In conclusion, IVIG treatment induces NK cell proliferation, which is essential for IVIG-mediated protection of GVHD in our mouse model. Furthermore, activated T cells are mandatory for effective IVIG-induced NK cell proliferation. These results shed light on a new mechanism of action of IVIG and could explain why the efficacy of IVIG in preventing GVHD in a clinical setting, where patients receive CsA, has never been undoubtedly demonstrated."
5670577	"Women have lower glomerular filtration (GFR) than men for the same serum creatinine (Cr) value, not accounted for in model for end-stage liver disease (MELD). We compare male/female Cr, GFR (using MDRD formula) and respective MELD scores in 403 Cr measurements using standard (sCr), O'Leary modified (mCr) and Compensated (cCr) Jaffe and Enzymatic (eCr) in 158 liver disease patients, mCr in 208 liver transplantation (LT) candidates, and EDTA-Cr(51)-GFR in 38 other candidates for LT; considering each female as male, a 'corrected' Cr was derived. MELD scores were calculated for measured and ""corrected"" Cr in females. Median Cr and GFR in females were lower than males (p <    0.05). Both MDRD and EDTA-Cr(51) GFR were lower in females than males, despite lower Cr values. In females, each MELD score was lower than the corresponding MELD-corrected Cr (p <    0.001) with >    or =three-point difference in liver disease patients: 25%[sCr]; 23%[mCr]; 11%[eCr]; and 14%[cCr]. In 65% of female LT candidates, two- or three-point difference was found. Females with liver disease have lower GFR than males for the same Cr value; correcting Cr increases MELD score by two or three points in 65% of female LT candidates. MELD score adjustment in females would ensure equal LT priority by gender."
3023526	"The presence of peroxidase in mitochondria from etiolated mung bean hypocotyls and skunk cabbage spadices, suggested by carbon monoxide difference spectra and the spectral response to methyl hydroperoxide, was shown to result from contamination of the isolated mitochondria by a denser particle fraction with high peroxidase activity. The mitochondria themselves have no peroxidatic activity. Analysis of the homogenate of mung bean hypocotyls revealed that over 90% of the peroxidase was soluble, as expected. Sonication of the isolated mitochondria, however, did not remove all the peroxidase from the particulate fraction, indicating that some of this enzyme is tightly bound to a membrane. These results suggest that the peroxidase in plant cells is localized in lysosomes or microbodies, most of which are ruptured on tissue homogenization to give soluble peroxidase, but some of which survive and appear as membrane bound peroxidase."
2809146	"Patients with anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) disease are at increased risk of morbidity and mortality from renal failure, pulmonary haemorrhage or complications of treatment. One-third also have circulating anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA). The aim of this study was to determine the clinicopathologic predictors of patient and renal outcomes in anti-GBM disease with or without ANCA.                                                                              Retrospective review of 43 patients diagnosed with anti-GBM disease over 20 years in two centres, including nine with dual anti-GBM and ANCA positivity. Renal biopsies from 27 patients were scored for the presence of active and chronic lesions.                                                                              Dual-positive patients were almost 20 years older than those with anti-GBM positivity alone (P = 0.003). The overall 1-year patient and renal survivals were 88 and 16%, respectively. Oligoanuria at diagnosis was the strongest predictor of mortality; none of the 16 patients without oligoanuria died. In a Cox regression model excluding oligoanuria, age was the only other independent predictor of survival. Pulmonary haemorrhage and dialysis dependence did not influence mortality. Thirty-five of the forty-three (81%) patients required dialysis at presentation, including all nine dual-positive patients. Of them, only two (5.7%) regained renal function at 1 year. By logistic regression, oligoanuria at diagnosis and percentage of crescents were independent predictors of dialysis independence at 3 months. However, in biopsied patients, the presence of crescents (>   75%) added little to the presence of oligoanuria in predicting dialysis independence. Histological activity and chronicity indices did not predict renal outcome. Two of the nine (22%) dual-positive patients relapsed compared with none of the anti-GBM alone patients. Seven patients received kidney transplants without disease recurrence.                                                                                      Oligoanuria is the strongest predictor of patient and renal survival while percentage of glomerular crescents is the only pathologic parameter associated with poor renal outcome in anti-GBM disease. Kidney biopsy may not be necessary in oligoanuric patients without pulmonary haemorrhage."
5090475	"We have induced photoallergic contact dermatitis in mice to 3,3',4',5 tetrachlorosalicylanilide (TCSA), chlorpromazine and 6-methylcoumarin. These compounds are known to produce photoallergic contact dermatitis in humans. The photoallergic contact dermatitis reaction in the mouse is immunologically specific viz. mice photosensitized to TCSA react, by photochallenge, to that compound and not to chlorpromazine, and conversely. The reaction requires UVA at both sensitization and challenge. It appears to be T-cell mediated in that it can be passively transferred to syngeneic mice by lymph node cells from actively sensitized mice, the histology of the reactions resembles that of classic allergic contact dermatitis in mice, challenge reactions are seen at 24 but not at 4 hr, and photoallergic contact dermatitis can be induced in B-cell deficient mice. The availability of a mouse model for the study of photo-ACD will facilitate the identification of pertinent control mechanisms and may aid in the management of the disease. It is likely that a bioassay for photoallergens of humans can be based on this mouse model."
1792316	"Localized areas of indurated skin, which were adherent to the underlying tissues of the upper extremities, suddenly developed in 55-year-old woman. Histologic examination of these bound-down areas disclosed a thickening and inflammation of the deep fascia. There was an associated eosinophilia and a marked clinical improvement after 18 months of oral steroid therapy. These gross and microscopic findings, as well as the peripheral eosinophilia and clinical response while oral steroids were administered, are all characteristics of the recently described entity called eosinophilic fasciitis. Its recognition is important since it may be steroid responsive."
6828240	"Multifocal epithelial hyperplasia is a pathology of the oral mucosa which has been reported in diverse ethnic groups. Human papillomavirus (HPV) types 13 and 32 DNA has been detected in these lesions. The aims of this paper are to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of an outbreak in a rural community in the Mayan area of Mexico and to identify a possible route of transmission through saliva.                                                                              A cross-sectional study was conducted in Chemax (Yucatan, Mexico). Clinical and epidemiological data were obtained through direct interviews. Samples of oral cells and saliva were taken. HPV 13 and 32 were identified by polymerase chain reaction using specific primers.                                                                              A total of 57 patients were studied, of whom 79.1% were aged <   15 years, 38.6% were male, and 61.3% were female. The duration of lesions ranged from one month to 50 years. Lesions were located on the lips, jugal mucosa, and more frequently, the tongue. HPV 13 was found in all the patients and HPV 32 in none. A total of 42 saliva samples were positive for HPV 13.                                                                                      Human papillomavirus type 13 is involved in multifocal epithelial hyperplasia among the Mexican Mayan population. The presence of HPV 13 in cells from saliva, combined with poor hygiene behaviors, may explain the familial distribution of the pathology."
7610637	"Several oral and topical medications are available for the treatment of onychomycosis, a widespread fungal infection of the nail. Since efficacy criteria vary greatly among clinical trials for onychomycosis treatment, it is difficult for physicians to compare outcomes and determine the appropriate therapy for a given patient. The present analysis evaluates the efficacy criteria used in intention-to-treat clinical trials of itraconazole, terbinafine, and 8% ciclopirox nail lacquer, drugs approved by the US FDA for the treatment of onychomycosis. Efficacy parameters often appear to use subjective assessment tools and may not include the actual size measurement of the affected target nail as an efficacy variable. Parameters, which assess both mycologic and clinical cure, are frequently omitted from clinical trials. Not surprisingly, clinical trials with stringent efficacy criteria, which assess both mycologic and clinical response/cure without use of subjective methods, appear to have the lowest rates for both therapeutic response and complete cure. Thus, an evaluation of treatment options for onychomycosis cannot solely compare success/failure rates in clinical trials, but requires a critical appraisal of the efficacy criteria utilized in those trials."
7930363	"A dose-response effect has previously been demonstrated in topical minoxidil treatment of alopecia areata. Limitations in minoxidil solubility and percutaneous absorption have impaired the development of more effective topical therapy. Oral minoxidil (5 mg every 12 hours), a dose demonstrated to be relatively well tolerated if a 2-g sodium diet is strictly followed, was given to 65 patients with severe, treatment-resistant alopecia areata in an attempt to bypass the limitations of topical treatment and increase efficacy. Although hair regrowth progressed more rapidly and was more extensive with oral than topical 5% minoxidil, cosmetic response was seen only in 18% of the patients. Neither serum nor tissue levels of minoxidil correlated with response. These findings suggest that improved preparations of topical minoxidil, when used as a single therapeutic agent, are unlikely to be cosmetically effective in the majority of patients with severe alopecia areata."
3516668	"Alemtuzumab (ALT), a humanized monoclonal anti-CD52 antibody, was introduced in solid organ transplantation as an induction agent. ALT associated with anticalcineurins has provided a low incidence of acute rejection episodes (ARE) and potential tolerogenic properties. We analyzed the clinical outcomes and effects on peripheral Treg of renal transplant recipients treated with ALT. Six-month data on kidney alone or kidney combined with pancreas or liver patients treated with ALT and tacrolimus (TAC) in standard doses were compared with those on renal transplant recipients of similar demography who were not treated with ALT. We evaluated patient and graft survivals, ARE incidence, hematological parameters, renal function, adverse events, and CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T cells in peripheral blood. Demographics of recipients, donors, and transplants were similar in both groups. Mean HLA mismatch was slightly greater among ALT-treated patients (3.5 vs 2.5). No combined transplantation was performed in the ALT-untreated group. Patient and graft survivals were 100% without rejection or serious infections in both groups. ALT-treated recipients showed anemia and leukopenia in 3 patients as well as severe lymphopenia in 5 recipients, who partially recovered on day 90. Final mean plasma creatinine was 1.4 mg/dL, while calculated creatinine clearance was approximately 65 mL/min in both groups. Mean Treg cell percentage was higher among ALT-treated recipients than the comparative group or healthy controls (P <    .05). In conclusion, renal transplantation results obtained using ALT with rigorous immunosuppressive therapy were excellent; serious adverse events and acute rejection were absent. The effect of the increased proportion of Treg cells must be evaluated with longer observation."
5593619	"Resistance to Type I IFN (IFN-I)-induced anti-neoplastic effects has been reported in many tumors and arise, in part, from epigenetic silencing of IFN-stimulated genes by DNA methylation. We hypothesized that restoration of IFN-stimulated genes by co-administration of the demethylating drug 5-Aza-2'-Deoxycitidine (Decitabine; DAC) may enhance the susceptibility to IFN-I-mediated anti-tumoral effects in melanoma. We show that combined administration of IFN-I and DAC significantly inhibits the growth of murine and human melanoma cells, both in vitro and in vivo. Compared to controls, DAC/IFN-I-treated melanoma cells exhibited reduced cell growth, augmented apoptosis, and diminished migration. Moreover, IFN-I and DAC synergized to suppress the growth of 3D-human melanoma spheroids altering tumor architecture. These direct anti-tumor effects correlated with induction of the IFN-stimulated gene Mx1. In vivo, DAC/IFN-I significantly reduced melanoma growth via stimulation of adaptive immunity, promoting tumor-infiltrating CD8     +       T cells while inhibiting the homing of immunosuppressive CD11b     +       myeloid cells and regulatory T cells. Accordingly, exposure of human melanoma cells to DAC/IFN-I induced the recruitment of immune cells towards the tumor in a Matrigel-based microfluidic device. Our findings underscore a beneficial effect of DAC plus IFN-I combined treatment against melanoma through both direct and immune-mediated anti-tumor effects."

A 70-year-old woman had erythema, oedema and vesicles on sun-exposed areas after 5 days of itraconazole treatment for oral candidiasis. Oral photochallenge using itraconazole and sun irradiation was positive, but photopatch test was negative. Photosensitivity from azoles is an uncommon adverse effect. Only three other cases have been described, two induced by ketoconazole and one by itraconazole."
1963420	"An Ashkenazi Jewish Israeli family with two children affected with severe xeroderma pigmentosum was investigated. A son, XP12TA, developed skin cancer at 2 y and died at 10 y. A daughter, XP25TA, now 24 y old, was sun protected and began developing skin cancers at 10 y. Their cultured skin fibroblasts showed reductions in post-ultraviolet survival (11% of normal), unscheduled DNA synthesis (10% of normal), global genome DNA repair (15% of normal), and plasmid host cell reactivation (5% of normal). Transcription-coupled DNA repair was normal, however. Northern blot analysis revealed greatly reduced xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C mRNA. A plasmid host cell reactivation assay assigned the cells to xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C. Cells from both parents and an unaffected child exhibited normal post-ultraviolet-C survival and normal DNA repair. Sequencing the xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C cDNA of XP12TA and XP25TA revealed a homozygous deletion of two bases (del AT 669-670) in exon 5 with a new termination site 10 codons downstream that is expected to encode a truncated xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C protein. Sequence analysis of the xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C cDNA in cells from the parents found identical heterozygous mutations: one allele carries both the exon 5 frameshift and an exon 15 polymorphism and the other allele carries neither alteration. Cells from the unaffected brother had two normal xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C alleles. This frameshift mutation in the xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C gene led to reduced DNA repair with multiple skin cancers and early death. Sun protection delayed the onset of skin cancer and prolonged life in a sibling with the same mutation."
8357391	"Patients suffering from intestinal failure present unique and difficult challenges to the transplant team. Augmenting the need for interdisciplinary teamwork is the higher incidence of death on the intestinal transplant waiting list. Successful management of this population requires an interdisciplinary approach at each stage of care, beginning with evaluation and continuing through discharge and lifetime management. A close relationship between patients, their caregivers, and all members of the transplant team is an essential component to successful lifetime management. Open communication between team members and unlimited accessibility to each other enables work flow to be managed efficiently, and enables the provision of optimal care. In this article, we describe the functions of the nonphysician clinical personnel needed to manage the intestinal transplant patient--beginning at the evaluation through lifetime follow-up care. The goal of each professional is the same: to restore the patient to the best quality of life possible."

It primarily affects the skin of children and has a distinctive histologic pattern of anastomosing vascular channels with intravascular papillary outpouchings projecting, sometimes, in a glomerulus-like pattern, into a lumen lined by atypical columnar endothelial cells. Since its original description 30 years ago by one of us, knowledge in this area has expanded."
1214924	"This article describes treatment of the ailing implant (bone loss with pocketing but static at the maintenance checks) and the failing implant (bone loss with pocketing, bleeding upon probing, purulence, and evidence of continuing bone loss irrespective of therapy). Because the surface of the implant is contaminated with endotoxin, it must be detoxified before any regenerative therapy. Studies have shown that citric acid is effective in detoxifying the hydroxyapatite-coated surfaces while tetracycline is more effective in sterilizing the metallic substrate fixtures. Guided tissue regeneration is useful as a ""barrier"" to prevent exfoliation of the grafted material. Both nonresorbable and resorbable materials have been used with great success. Allografts (freeze-dried bone) and alloplasts (synthetic materials) may be used to achieve a sulcus of decreased depth and possibly some type of osseous regeneration. The author recommends the use of the allograft if the surface is completely detoxified and the alloplast if it is not certain that the surface is sterilized and free of endotoxin. The allograft, being resorbable, will not effect biologic healing against a contaminated surface; hence, the use of the alloplast to ""fill"" the defect and prevent epithelial invagination."
5994035	"Paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP) is an autoimmune bullous disease, which associates mainly with lymphoproliferative neoplasms. Bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) with progressive respiratory failure is a significant cause of death in PNP. We report a case of PNP associated with follicular lymphoma and BO, which showed findings suggesting coexistence of bullous pemphigoid (BP). The patient showed bullous and ulcerative lesions on the lips and oral cavity, and flaccid blisters on the trunk and thighs associated with anti-desmoglein (Dsg)3 antibodies. At later disease stage after commencement of treatment, anti-BP180 antibodies and tense blister formation were observed. It was proposed that persistent interface dermatitis is the first event in PNP, and subsequently induce the production of autoantibodies to Dsg and components of the basement membrane zone, resulting in both intraepidermal and subepidermal blisters. We speculate that interface dermatitis caused by autoreactive T cells induced autoantibody production against Dsg3, and subsequently against BP180."
6607490	"Gaucher's disease (GD), a lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding glucocerebrosidase (GCD), is currently treated by enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) using recombinant GCD that is administered intravenously every 2 weeks. However, intravenous administration includes discomfort or pain and might cause local and systemic infections that may lead to low patient compliance. An orally administered drug has the potential to alleviate these problems. In this study, we describe the potential use of plant cells as a vehicle for the oral delivery of recombinant human GCD (prGCD) expressed in carrot cells. The in vitro results demonstrate that the plant cells protect the recombinant protein in the gastric fluids and may enable absorption into the blood. Feeding experiments, with rat and pig as model animals, using carrot cells containing prGCD, show that active recombinant prGCD was found in the digestive tract and blood system and reached both, liver and spleen, the target organs in GD. These results demonstrate that the oral administration of proteins encapsulated in plant cells is feasible. Specifically, carrot cells containing recombinant human prGCD can be used as an oral delivery system and are a feasible alternative to intravenous administration of ERT for GD."
9731858	"Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders are lymphoid proliferations or lymphomas, usually associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection, that develop as the consequence of immunodepression. These disorders usually affect patients receiving high doses of cyclosporine in the context of bone marrow or organ transplantations. Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders can regress when cyclosporine is discontinued. Such lymphoproliferations rarely occur for patients receiving low-dose cyclosporine treatments for autoimmune disorders. In the following report, we describe a patient with psoriasis vulgaris treated with long-term low-dose cyclosporine who developed an acute Epstein-Barr virus-associated clonal lymphoproliferative disorder associated with hemophagocytic syndrome. This lymphoproliferative disorder resembling classic posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder regressed when cyclosporine was discontinued."
6829821	"The destructive action of alloantiserum and exogenous complement on ingrowing skin allografts was studied. B6AF1 recipients of a B10.D2 skin graft received a single intravenous injection of B6AF1 anti-B10.D2 serum (antiserum to H-2K.31) together with rabbit complement (RC) within the first 10 days after transplantation. Different models were used: recipients without immunosuppression, recipients treated with antilymphocyte serum, x-irradiation, or enhancing antibody. If the injection was given between day 5 and 10 after grafting, hyperacute rejection occurred in all cases. The rejection seemed to be most violent when the injection was given on days 7 or 8. Injections given on days 1, 2 or 3 after grafting could not induce hyperacute-rejection, but resulted, on the contrary, in a prolongation of graft survival, probably due to immunological enhancement. Injections on day 4 produced patchy necrosis, but the grafts recovered and the residual tissue showed a prolonged survival. The results suggest that the presence of a functioning vascular network is a prerequisite for the occurrence of hyperacute rejection of skin allografts in the mouse."

2739288	"Leaves exposed to potassium (K) deficiency usually present decreased mesophyll conductance (g     m       ) and photosynthesis (A). The relative contributions of leaf anatomical traits in determining g     m       have been quantified; however, anatomical variabilities related to low g     m       under K starvation remain imperfectly known. A one-dimensional model was used to quantify anatomical controls of the entire CO     2       diffusion pathway resistance within a leaf on two Brassica napus L. cultivars in response to K deficiency. Leaf photosynthesis of both cultivars was significantly decreased under K deficiency in parallel with down-regulated g     m       . The mesophyll conductance limitation contributed to more than one-half of A decline. The decreased internal air space in K-starved leaves was associated with the increase of gas-phase resistance. Potassium deficiency reduced liquid-phase conductance by decreasing the exposed surface area of chloroplasts per unit leaf area (S     c       /S), and enlarging the resistance of the cytoplasm that can be interpreted by the increasing distance of chloroplast from cell wall, and between adjacent chloroplasts. Additionally, the discrepancies of A between two cultivars were in part because of g     m       variations, ascribing to an altered S     c       /S. These results emphasize the important role of K on the regulation of g     m       by enhancing S     c       /S and reducing cytoplasm resistance."

We report three patients with this distinct entity. In all three cases patients initially presented with prurigo-like lesions and in one case nodular lesions preceded the onset of blistering by many months. Direct immunofluorescence was positive in all cases, with linear basement membrane zone deposition of IgG and C3. Circulating IgG antibasement membrane antibody was detected in two cases, and in these two patients on salt-split immuno-fluorescence the antibodies bound to the roof of the bullae."

8158344	"Psoriasis is a lifelong, incurable disease that normally develops before the age of 30 years and affects approximately 1.4% of the Spanish population. Numerous clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of efalizumab, a recombinant, humanized, monoclonal antibody, which has been approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. However, clinical trials do not necessarily reflect routine clinical practice because they are conducted under controlled conditions and in specific populations. In this paper, we describe our experiences at a large University Hospital in Spain using efalizumab to manage patients with psoriasis. We found that patients who respond to treatment at week 12 usually demonstrate long-term disease control with continuous use of efalizumab. Early response may be easiest to achieve in patients with extensive body surface area (BSA) involvement and low Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) scores for erythema, induration and desquamation. However, evaluation of treatment success after 12 weeks may be premature in patients with moderate or low BSA involvement if they have clinically significant PASI scores for erythema, induration and desquamation. In our experience, the safety profile is good and patients appreciate the convenience of efalizumab compared with other interventions."

The young person who is intellectually impaired or who must struggle to master daily living skills faces more challenges in this process than other adolescents. Physicians, nurses, social workers, occupational therapists, and other health care providers must work with adolescents, their parents, and teachers to assess abilities and transition needs. Communication skills, capacity for decision making, adherence, vocational and educational issues, sexuality, and relationships should be addressed. Interventions may include the creation of an individualized transition plan, skills training, family counseling, a lengthened transition process, involvement in a support group, health promotion, and teaching of self-care skills. The summary for the adult provider should include information about how best to communicate with the young person and an assessment of capacity to make decisions and self-management skills."

3205358	"Annular lichen planus is a rare, unique subtype of lichen planus. We report a 34-year-old Japanese male who had multiple, dark red to purple, annular macules with slightly raised borders. Histopathological examination of a skin biopsy specimen from the peripheral region of the macule showed the typical features of lichen planus. Immunohistochemical stainings revealed that a number of CD1a-positive, S-100-protein-positive Langerhans cells were present at the border zone of the annular lesion and most of the infiltrating cells were CD4-positive, CD8-negative lymphocytes. Conversely, inside the annular lesion, the number of Langerhans cells was decreased, and an equal number of CD4-positive cells and CD8-positive cells was present in the sparse infiltration. These results suggest that activation of Langerhans cells initiated a lichenoid tissue reaction but a subsequent depletion of Langerhans cells suppressed the lymphocyte infiltration. These sequential events might be involved in the formation of the unique annular structure in this condition."
4072533	"The role of glutathione (GSH) in protecting plants from chilling injury was analyzed in seedlings of a chilling-tolerant maize (Zea mays L.) genotype using buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), a specific inhibitor of gamma-glutamylcysteine (gammaEC) synthetase, the first enzyme of GSH synthesis. At 25 degrees C, 1 mM BSO significantly increased cysteine and reduced GSH content and GSH reductase (GR: EC 1.6.4.2) activity, but interestingly affected neither fresh weight nor dry weight nor relative injury. Application of BSO up to 1 mM during chilling at 5 degrees C reduced the fresh and dry weights of shoots and roots and increased relative injury from 10 to almost 40%. Buthionine sulfoximine also induced a decrease in GR activity of 90 and 40% in roots and shoots, respectively. Addition of GSH or gammaEC together with BSO to the nutrient solution protected the seedlings from the BSO effect by increasing the levels of GSH and GR activity in roots and shoots. During chilling, the level of abscisic acid increased both in controls and BSO-treated seedlings and decreased after chilling in roots and shoots of the controls and in the roots of BSO-treated seedlings, but increased in their shoots. Taken together, our results show that BSO did not reduce chilling tolerance of the maize genotype analyzed by inhibiting abscisic acid accumulation but by establishing a low level of GSH, which also induced a decrease in GR activity."

Of 234 patients, 168 (72%) were referred through the DA route and 66 (28%) through the GK route. A significant association was found between physician delay and access route; patients in the DA group underwent biopsy sooner (<    or =3 months vs >   3 months) than those in the GK group (P<   .001). No significant difference was observed in stage at diagnosis (predominantly stage IA), proportion of nodular melanoma (DA 4% vs GK 2%), patient delay, or median tumor thickness between DA and GK routes (0.42 mm vs 0.50 mm, respectively). A trend toward a greater proportion of histologically ulcerated melanoma was observed in the DA group compared with the GK group (12% vs 5%, respectively; P = .06).                                                                                      This pilot study demonstrated no difference in outcome between GK and DA routes as measured by melanoma thickness and stage, although patients in the DA group underwent diagnostic biopsy sooner than those in the GK group.

5148270	"Plastid DNA engineering is a well-established research area of plant biotechnology, and plastid transgenes often give high expression levels. However, it is still almost impossible to predict the accumulation rate of heterologous protein in transplastomic plants, and there are many cases of unsuccessful transgene expression. Chloroplasts regulate their proteome at the post-transcriptional level, mainly through translation control. One of the mechanisms to modulate the translation has been described in plant chloroplasts for the chloroplast-encoded subunits of multiprotein complexes, and the autoregulation of the translation initiation of these subunits depends on the availability of their assembly partners [control by epistasy of synthesis (CES)]. In Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, autoregulation of endogenous proteins recruited in the assembly of functional complexes has also been reported. In this study, we revealed a self-regulation mechanism triggered by the accumulation of a soluble recombinant protein, phaseolin, in the stroma of chloroplast-transformed tobacco plants. Immunoblotting experiments showed that phaseolin could avoid this self-regulation mechanism when targeted to the thylakoids in transplastomic plants. To inhibit the thylakoid-targeted phaseolin translation as well, this protein was expressed in the presence of a nuclear version of the phaseolin gene with a transit peptide. Pulse-chase and polysome analysis revealed that phaseolin mRNA translation on plastid ribosomes was repressed due to the accumulation in the stroma of the same soluble polypeptide imported from the cytosol. We suggest that translation autoregulation in chloroplast is not limited to heteromeric protein subunits but also involves at least some of the foreign soluble recombinant proteins, leading to the inhibition of plastome-encoded transgene expression in chloroplast."
1707575	"Chronic liver diseases are known to cause several skin manifestations, including cutaneous vascular changes such as spider naevus and palmar erythema. Arteriovenous haemangioma (AVH), a benign acquired cutaneous vascular lesion, has also been reported to be associated with chronic liver disease. We report here four cases of AVH in patients with chronic liver disease: (i) a 59-year-old man who had suffered from chronic active hepatitis associated with hepatitis C virus for 15 years; (ii) a 48-year-old man who had suffered from alcoholic hepatitis for 3 years and was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis 1 year ago; (iii) a 69-year-old female who had had chronic active hepatitis associated with hepatitis C virus infection for 20 years and was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis 7 years ago; and (iv) a 48-year-old man who had had chronic active hepatitis associated with hepatitis B virus infection for about 20 years. All patients showed an asymptomatic solitary dome-shaped reddish papule, 5-10 mm in diameter, on the face (first, second and third patients) or chest (fourth patient). Histopathological examination of the tumours revealed features of AVH, namely a well-circumscribed lesion composed of vascular structures of various sizes reminiscent of arteries and veins. In all four cases, elastic-van Gieson stain showed the absence of an internal elastic lamina in the thick-walled vessels as well as the thin-walled vessels. Examination of multiple sections demonstrated glomus cells and an ascending artery feeding the tumour vessels in only one case. Slight inflammatory cell infiltration was seen in the stroma of three patients while Toluidine blue staining revealed an increased number of mast cells in the stroma in all lesions. The present cases suggest that the occurrence of AVH associated with chronic liver disease is not related to any specific liver disease, but may be related to chronic liver dysfunction itself."
3971892	"Adoptive transfer of thymus-derived natural regulatory T cells (nTregs) effectively suppresses disease in murine models of autoimmunity and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). TGFß induces Foxp3 expression and suppressive function in stimulated murine CD4+25- T cells, and these induced Treg (iTregs), like nTreg, suppress auto- and allo-reactivity in vivo. However, while TGFß induces Foxp3 expression in stimulated human T cells, the expanded cells lack suppressor cell function. Here we show that Rapamycin (Rapa) enhances TGFß-dependent Foxp3 expression and induces a potent suppressor function in naive (CD4+ 25-45RA+) T cells. Rapa/TGFß iTregs are anergic, express CD25 at levels higher than expanded nTregs and few cells secrete IL-2, IFNγ or IL-17 even after PMA and Ionomycin stimulation in vitro. Unlike other published methods of inducing Treg function, Rapa/TGFß induces suppressive function even in the presence of memory CD4+ T cells. A single apheresis unit of blood yields an average ~240 × 10⁹ (range ~ 70-560 × 10⁹) iTregs from CD4+25- T cells in ≤ 2 weeks of culture. Most importantly, Rapa/TGFß iTregs suppress disease in a xenogeneic model of GVHD. This study opens the door for iTreg cellular therapy for human diseases."
6323847	"Epigenetic gene silencing results from the inhibition of transcription or from posttranscriptional RNA degradation. DNA methylation is one of the most central and frequently discussed elements of gene silencing in both plants and mammals. Because DNA methylation has not been detected in yeast, Drosophila or Caenorhabditis elegans, the standard genetic workhorses, plants are important models for revealing the role of DNA methylation in the epigenetic regulation of genes in vivo."
9506783	"Renal transplantation increases the probability of malignant tumors by about 2-4-fold overall with a much higher rate for renal epithelial malignancy. Renal tumors in renal transplant recipients are commonly conventional clear cell or papillary renal cell carcinoma. Clear cell papillary renal cell carcinoma is a recently described unique renal epithelial neoplasm with scant eosinophilic or moderate amount of clear cytoplasm and pyknotic small nuclei oriented commonly toward the apical surfaces. No such tumor has been reported in renal transplant recipients. In this paper, we describe a clear cell papillary renal cell carcinoma involving bilateral native kidneys in a patient who had received a renal transplant 2 years earlier. Clear cell papillary renal cell carcinoma commonly presents with low pathologic stage and lower Fuhrman grade and is clinically indolent. Additional cases are needed to evaluate the clinical behavior of this type of tumor in renal transplant recipients."
9705932	"A multicentre trial for the treatment of dermatophyte onychomycosis of the toenails with terbinafine was carried out in Australia and New Zealand. Between eight and 12 nail samples were obtained from each of the 118 patients in the 48-week trial, and each sample was investigated by direct microscopy and culture for dermatophyte and non-dermatophyte fungi. Patients were randomized to treatment with terbinafine at 250 mg/day or placebo for the first 12 weeks of the study, then non-responders were offered a 12-week course of terbinafine from week 28. All patients had a dermatophyte infection. In 42 patients (36%) microscopy and mycological culture identified dermatophytes alone. In the remaining 76 patients (64%), a non-dermatophyte mould or yeast was also isolated at some stage during the trial, but in only three patients did the same non-dermatophyte persist in two or more successive nail specimens. The presence of a fungal contaminant in addition to a dermatophyte had no apparent effect on the efficacy of treatment with terbinafine. We conclude that non-dermatophyte moulds and yeasts are generally found as contaminating organisms in dermatophyte onychomycosis, secondary to the dermatophytes, and that they do not influence the outcome of treatment."
6082848	"A 67-year-old white man presented with bilateral blancing erythema and scale of the second through fifth toes extending on to the dorsa and moccasin areas of the feet for two years. The right great toe had subungual debris. No cultures or KOH studies were recorded. A course of tolnaftate cream therapy was initiated. Two years later, the patient returned and complained of no change in his condition. Previously recorded descriptions and diagrams in the medical record confirmed his report. At this time, KOH preparations from the skin and nail were positive for hyphae. He refused to accept medical recommendations for a fungal culture and griseofulvin therapy. He, therefore, was instructed to use miconazole cream twice daily as alternative treatment. One year later, physical examination was unchanged. KOH preparations and fungal cultures of the skin were twice negative. A 4-mm punch skin biopsy specimen of the erythematous patch on the dorsum of the foot was performed. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections revealed a proliferating vascular process in the cutis. Many spindle-shaped cells formed vascular slits and endothelial-lined spaces in which there were erythrocytes. No hyphae were seen. One year after the biopsy specimen was taken, the erythema of his feet persists, and a few nonblanching nodules are visible. He declined further studies."
6449628	"From the medical and ethical points of view, donation after brain death is a more acceptable organ source than that from a living donor because it has the advantage of providing multiple organs from a single donor source. Hence, it has become a more promising field of research which focuses on the protection of organs at brain death Here we investigated the role of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 in a porcine model of brain death.                                                                              A porcine model of brain death was established by increasing the intracranial pressure (ICP) after which TGF-β1 was monitored by immunofluorescence at the following time points: before ICP was performed (t1), at brain death (t2), and at 3 (t3), 6 (t4), 9 (t5), and 18 (t6) hours after brain death. The data were analyzed using the fixed effect regression method and the correlation between the results was determined by Pearson analysis.                                                                              Our results showed that there was a significant increase in the levels of TGF-β1 (P <    .05), urea (P <    .01), creatinine (P <    .01), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST; P <    .01) during the 18-hour brain death process. There were negative correlations between TGF-β1 and urea, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, AST, and total bilirubin. The negative correlations between TGF-β1 and creatinine and AST achieved statistical significance (P <    .05).                                                                                      These findings taken together confirm that significant damages are caused to the myocardial fiber cell and kidney glomerulus during brain death process, and that TGF-β1 is associated with the protection of these organs."
1586498	"For periodontal tissue engineering, it is a primary requisite and a challenge to select the optimum types of cells, properties of scaffold, and growth factor combination to reconstruct a specific tissue in its natural form and with the appropriate function. Owing to fundamental disadvantages associated with using a two-dimensional substrate, several methods of seeding cells into three-dimensional scaffolds have been reported and the authors have asserted its usefulness and effectiveness. In this study, we explore the cell attachment of periodontal ligament fibroblasts on nanohydroxyapatite (n-HA) scaffold using avidin biotin binding system (ABBS).                                                                              Human periodontal ligament fibroblasts were isolated from the health tooth extracted for the purpose of orthodontic procedure. HA nanoparticles were prepared and Ca(NO(3))(2)-4H(2)O and (OC(2)H(5))(3)P were selected as precursors of HA sol. The final scaffold was 8 mm in diameter and 3 mm in height disk with porosity value of 81.55%. 1×10(5) periodontal ligament fibroblasts were applied to each scaffold. The cells were seeded into scaffolds by static, agitating and ABBS seeding method.                                                                              The number of periodontal ligament fibroblasts attached was greater for ABBS seeding method than for static or agitating method (P<   0.05). No meaningful difference has been observed among seeding methods with scanning electron microscopy images. However, increased strength of cell attachment of ABBS could be deduced from the high affinity between avidin and biotin (Kd=10(-15) M).                                                                                      The high-affinity ABBS enhances the ability of periodontal ligament fibroblasts to attach to three-dimensionally constructed n-HA scaffolds."
1416627	"We assessed the ability of ebselen, a glutathione peroxidase mimic, to reduce pigmentation in various models. In murine B16 melanocytes, 25 μm ebselen inhibited melanogenesis and induced a depolymerisation of actin filaments. In co-cultures of B16 melanocytes with BDVII keratinocytes, a pretreatment of melanocytes with ebselen resulted in a strong inhibition of melanosome transfer to keratinocytes, as shown under optical and electron microscopy. In reconstructed epidermis, topical 0.5% ebselen led to a twofold decrease of melanin without affecting the density of active melanocytes. A similar result was obtained with topical 0.5% ebselen in black guinea pig ears. Ebselen induced a decrease of epidermal melanin parallel to a localisation of melanin and melanosomes in the basal layer. Ebselen appears as a new depigmenting compound that inhibits melanin synthesis and melanosome transfer to keratinocytes."
9962874	"Physicians have become increasingly interested in obtaining the hardware, software, and connection necessary to take advantage of the educational and practice material available on the World Wide Web (WWW) (i.e., on the Internet). The related ongoing development of unique on-line resources promises to provide a compelling force for change in the way in which information is accessed and medicine is practiced. WWW applications created for dermatologists often include high-quality images, and proper viewing is critical to use this information. Because images tend to be large files, and dermatology resources tend to have from several up to hundreds of images, the speed of transfer and display and the quality of the display are important factors to consider. This study was an evaluation of some of the current options in the hardware, software, and Internet connections to determine desirable configurations for accessing image-rich, on-line dermatology WWW applications."

The clinical findings in our patients closely resemble those of the cases described in previous reports on Sweet's syndrome. However, oral and genital mucosal involvement, non-tenderness of the lesions and a pustular eruption elsewhere made us consider Behçet's disease. Besides the clinical findings, vasculitis was clearly demonstrated in the skin biopsy specimens."

8698374	"Floral scent has been extensively investigated in plants of the South American genus Petunia. Flowers of Petunia integrifolia emit mostly benzaldehyde, while flowers of Petunia axillaris subsp. axillaris emit a mixture of volatile benzenoid and phenylpropanoid compounds that include isoeugenol and eugenol. Flowers of the artificial hybrid Petunia hybrida, a cross between P. integrifolia and P. axillaris, emit a similar spectrum of volatiles as P. axillaris subsp. axillaris. However, the flowers of P. axillaris subsp. parodii emit neither isoeugenol nor eugenol but contain high levels of dihydroconiferyl acetate in the petals, the main scent-synthesizing and scent-emitting organs. We recently showed that both isoeugenol and eugenol in P. hybrida are biosynthesized from coniferyl acetate in reactions catalyzed by isoeugenol synthase (PhIGS1) and eugenol synthase (PhEGS1), respectively, via a quinone methide-like intermediate. Here we show that P. axillaris subsp. parodii has a functional EGS gene that is expressed in flowers, but its IGS gene contains a frame-shift mutation that renders it inactive. Despite the presence of active EGS enzyme in P. axillaris subsp. parodii, in the absence of IGS activity the coniferyl acetate substrate is converted by an as yet unknown enzyme to dihydroconiferyl acetate. By contrast, suppressing the expression of PhIGS1 in P. hybrida by RNA interference also leads to a decrease in isoeugenol biosynthesis, but instead of the accumulation of dihydroconiferyl acetate, the flowers synthesize higher levels of eugenol."
5616622	"Diabetic disease is increasing rapidly and vast amounts of resources are spent in all countries. Thus, the screening of new compounds including plant extracts for antidiabetic effects is mandatory. In this review both simple assays [e.g., on blood glucose (after or without a glucose load), plasma insulin and extrapancreatic effects] are described as well as specific in vivo tests in diabetic animals and in vitro tests with respect to the mechanism of compounds. In total, approx. 30 selected tests are evaluated and references are given. Thus, the investigator is guided through the tests and is advised that measuring only one parameter such as glucose will not be sufficient. In the case that the financial resources are poor for the investigator, more than glucose still has to be measured. A balance is made by describing absolutely necessary investigations while concentrating on those at low cost. It has to be started with simple assays; to use one test only, however, means oversimplifying the diabetes disease; additionally antidiabetic effects may be missing. The investigator is guided through the advantages and limitations of diabetic animal models and is advised about specific in vitro tests to look at the mechanism of action. All investigators should profit from these details, not only the phytoresearchers."
1895368	"Among all patients with a pathologic diagnosis of juvenile xanthogranuloma (JXG) seen at our institution from 1983 to 1994, we identified five patients with an unusual histologic pattern that differed from the classic juvenile xanthogranuloma (CJXG) with foamy cells and Touton giant cells. Four of these five cases, which we termed nonlipidized juvenile xanthogranuloma (NJXG), were seen in infants. The histologic features include a monomorphic infiltrate with absent or few foam cells and Touton giant cells. There is little inflammation, and mitotic figures are easily found. Four cases exhibit a diffuse sheetlike pattern while one is trabecular. Immunoperoxidase staining was done. All lesions are consistently positive for factor XIIIa as opposed to only focally positive or negative in CJXG and negative in Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). The S-100 was negative. NJXG represents an atypical histologic variant of JXG, which may suggest a malignant or aggressive tumor. The follow-up, however, indicates that these lesions behave in a fashion similar to those of CJXG. The differential diagnosis should be made with LCH, intradermal nevus, and reticulohistiocytosis. The immunoperoxidase findings help to differentiate NJXG from these entities."
2796957	"The efficacy of several sugars and polyalcohols in preculture medium was investigated using Anigozanthos viridis ssp terraspectans Hopper (Haemodoraceae), a threatened plant species endemic to the south west of Western Australia. A vitrification protocol involving preculturing of shoot apices for 3 days on different concentrations of sugars and polyalcohols, followed by incubation in plant vitrification solution 2 (PVS2) for 25 min, prior to immersion in liquid nitrogen (LN) and warming resulted in shoot tip survival ranging from 34 to 84%. High levels of survival were obtained with polyalcohols, compared to sucrose, glucose, trehalose and raffinose when used at the same molarity (0.4 M) or at the equivalent concentration of total hydroxyl (OH) groups present in molecules. In both cases glycerol proved more effective. When polyalcohols (ribitol and erythritol) with similar stereochemical arrangement of OH groups as glycerol were examined, at the same molarity (0.4 M) and with equivalent OH numbers, higher survival was achieved when the total number of OH groups present was the same as glycerol. Additionally, when the structural isomers mannitol/sorbitol and ribitol/xylitol were compared at the same molarity (0.4 M), the isomer with the higher number of OH groups along the same side resulted in significantly higher levels of post-LN survival. We propose that the mode of action of polyalcohols is based not on molarity, but on the total number of OH groups present in the medium. Furthermore, based on these results we propose that the orientation of OH groups is a determining factor in effective cryopreservation."
4866782	"The world of health care has changed. We can't operate on 17th century models and be successful. We don't have to argue for the movement to committed, inspired leadership models, and the death of compliance leadership. There is abundant research to document this is the way we must go. In reality, we have a moral obligation to provide the kind of work environment that provides the meaningful work that Maslow (1998) tells us makes life meaningful. No one has the right to make people miserable at work because we have failed to create the cultures that create commitment, inspiration, and transformation for our patients, their families, and our staff. It is unfortunate that in times of staff shortages, this message is heard louder. We should be equally committed no matter what the situation, because it is the right thing to do. We do not have the right to be abusive to others in any context."
8395321	"Chrysanthemum is one of important ornamental species in the world. Its highly heterozygous state complicates molecular analysis, so it is of interest to derive haploid forms. A total of 2579 non-fertilized chrysanthemum ovules pollinated by Argyranthemum frutescens were cultured in vitro to isolate haploid progeny. One single regenerant emerged from each of three of the 105 calli produced. Chromosome counts and microsatellite fingerprinting showed that only one of the regenerants was a true haploid. Nine doubled haploid derivatives were subsequently generated by colchicine treatment of 80 in vitro cultured haploid nodal segments. Morphological screening showed that the haploid plant was shorter than the doubled haploids, and developed smaller leaves, flowers, and stomata. An in vitro pollen germination test showed that few of the haploid's pollen were able to germinate and those which did so were abnormal. Both the haploid and the doubled haploids produced yellow flowers, whereas those of the maternal parental cultivar were mauve. Methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism (MSAP) profiling was further used to detect alterations in cytosine methylation caused by the haploidization and/or the chromosome doubling processes. While 52.2% of the resulting amplified fragments were cytosine methylated in the maternal parent's genome, the corresponding proportions for the haploid's and doubled haploids' genomes were, respectively, 47.0 and 51.7%, demonstrating a reduction in global cytosine methylation caused by haploidization and a partial recovery following chromosome doubling."
5137455	"Tissue engineering is an attempt to culture living tissues for surgical transplantation. In vitro and in vivo approaches have produced vascular and cardiovascular components, bone, cartilage, gastro-intestinal organs, and liver. Organogenesis is a different approach to create new organs for transplantation from embryonic tissue implanted into the omentum of the recipient. This technique has been employed in creating kidney and pancreas in animals. Tissue engineering and organogenesis are the future of transplantation medicine. The progress in this field is of tremendous importance because it can produce a new generation of morphologically complex tissues and organs. In this review article we have summarized the most relevant experiences in this area, including its perspectives for therapeutical applications."
4639303	"Omenn syndrome is a variant of SCID, inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder, and characterized by severe eczematoid dermatitis, eosinophilia, elevated serum IgE and a distinctive histology in enlarged lymph nodes. The etiology of Omenn syndrome is unknown, however, unlike other forms of SCID; patients with Omenn syndrome have activated T lymphocytes in their circulation capable of non-MHC restricted cytotoxic function. Recently, it has been observed that the use of immunosuppressive therapy, particularly cyclosporine, can modify the clinical manifestations of the disorder. Prior to the use of bone marrow transplantation this disease was universally fatal. Death typically occurred in infancy as the result of opportunistic infections and/or malignancies, most notably lymphomas. While bone marrow transplantation has become quite successful for many phenotypes of SCID, even with the use of alternative donors other than histocompatible siblings, in Omenn syndrome it remains a challenge. In our experience, patients with Omenn syndrome exhibit a higher incidence of Gram negative sepsis, before and during transplantation, and carry a significant risk of post-transplant rejection when compared with patients with other phenotypes of SCID. We report the results of six patients treated with bone marrow transplantation from alternative donors, three had unrelated donors (URD) and three had haplo-identical parental donors. Five of the six patients achieved complete and/or durable donor cell engraftment and only one patient experienced acute GVHD. Three patients died of transplant-related complications (infection or EBV-associated B cell lymphoma) between day +22 and day +95 post-transplant. Three patients survived more than 1 year post-transplant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
8283289	"The growth of Arabidopsis plants in chilling conditions could be related to their levels of salicylic acid (SA). Plants with the SA hydroxylase NahG transgene grew at similar rates to Col-0 wild types at 23 degrees C, and growth of both genotypes was slowed by transfer to 5 degrees C. However, at 5 degrees C, NahG plants displayed relative growth rates about one-third greater than Col-0, so that by 2 months NahG plants were typically 2.7-fold larger. This resulted primarily from greater cell expansion in NahG rosette leaves. Specific leaf areas and leaf area ratios remained similar in both genotypes. Net assimilation rates were similar in both genotypes at 23 degrees C, but higher in NahG at 5 degrees C. Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements revealed no PSII photodamage in chilled leaves of either genotype. Col-0 shoots at 5 degrees C accumulated SA, particularly in glucosylated form. SA in NahG shoots showed similar tendencies at 5 degrees C, but at greatly depleted levels. Catechol was not detected as a metabolite of the NahG transgene product. We also examined growth and SA levels in SA signaling and metabolism mutants at 5 degrees C. The partially SA-insensitive npr1 mutant displayed growth intermediate between NahG and Col-0, while the SA-deficient eds5 mutant behaved like NahG. In contrast, the cpr1 mutant at 5 degrees C accumulated very high levels of SA and its growth was much more inhibited than wild type. At both temperatures, cpr1 was the only SA-responsive genotype in which oxidative damage (measured as thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances) was significantly different from wild type."

A prospective randomized unicentric trial was conducted. In total, 112 patients entered the study; 57 in the intramuscular group and 55 patients in the intravenous group completed the trial. The failure rate was 14% for intramuscular group and 20% for the intravenous group (P = 0.40). Local complications such as of the leg abscesses were observed in the two groups (intravenous 9.1%, intramuscular 7%; P = 0477). Of the patients treated with intravenous benzyl penicillin, 25.5% presented complications related to the route (venitis). Intramuscular penicillin should be considered an effective and well-tolerated treatment of erysipelas in adult patients."
7828550	"Laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (LN) offers less postoperative pain and early recovery in living kidney donors, but graft kidney function in the recipients can be delayed due to prolonged warm ischemic time (WIT) and adverse effects of pneumoperitoneum. We compared the early function of the grafted kidney and the complications in kidney recipients after LN versus open nephrectomy (ON). We analyzed 109 kidney recipients from living donors, including 60 LN and 49 ON, comparing immediate diuresis after surgery, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by MDRD formula (modification of diet in renal disease) at day 5, and complications. The recipient age among the LN group was 20 to 73 years with 51% men among whom 95% of patients had immediate diuresis with GFR at day 5 varying from 4.85 to 99.45 mL/min/1.73 m(2) by MDRD Surgical complications were renal artery stenosis (5%) and urinary leakage (5%). The recipient among age ON cases varied from 18 to 63 years with 63% men and immediate diuresis observed in 87% and GFR at day 5 varied from 4.75 to 101.1 mL/min/1.73 m(2) by MDRD. Renal artery stenosis was observed in 8.16%. The WIT was longer (P <    .05) among the LN (1.4 to 11 minutes) compared with the ON group (1 to 4 minutes). GFR at day 5 showed no difference between the two groups. In conclusion, WIT was higher among LN compared with ON but did not seem to influence early function of the grafted kidney."
6750247	"Higher plants growing in natural environments experience various abiotic stresses. The aim of this study was to determine whether exposure to temperature-stress would lead to oxidative stress and whether this effect varied with different exposure periods. The thermal dependencies of the activities of protective enzymes, photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm), protein, non-protein thiol (NP-SH), cysteine content, lipoxygenase (LOX) activity (EC 1.13.11.12) and malondialdehyde (MDA) content at 25-40 degrees C were determined for 4, 24 and 48 h in leaf and root segments of Phalaenopsis. The increase in MDA level and LOX activity may be due to temperature-associated oxidative damage to leaf and root segments. Temperature-stress induced not only activities of active oxygen species (AOS) scavenging enzymes but also protein, NP-SH and cysteine content in both leaf and root segments at 30 degrees C for 4 and 24 h (except for 48 h in some cases) compared to 25 degrees C-and greenhouse-grown leaf and root segments indicating that antioxidants enzymes played an important role in protecting plant from temperature-stress. However, activities of dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR, EC 1.8.5.1), glutathione peroxidase (GPX, EC 1.11.1.9) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST, EC 2.5.1.18) in leaf and root, glutathione reductase (GR, EC 1.6.4.2) in leaf and guaiacol peroxidase (G-POD, 1.11.1.7) in root segments were induced significantly at 40 degrees C compared to 25 degrees C and greenhouse-grown plants suggesting that these enzymes play protective roles at high temperature. In contrast, activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1) and monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR, EC 1.6.5.4) in leaf and root, catalase (CAT, EC 1.11.1.6) in root, GR in root, and protein, cysteine, NP-SH content in both root and leaf and Fv/Fm ratio were diminished significantly at 40 degrees C compared to 25 degrees C-and greenhouse-grown plants. These indicate that these enzymes were apparently not involved in detoxification process and sensitive at higher temperature. Also, the close relation between activities of enzymes with their metabolites at 30 degrees C than 40 degrees C indicated that the antioxidants enzymes and metabolites both may play an important role in protecting cells against the temperature-stress."
7598549	"The objective of this paper is to introduce and emphasize the importance of psychological interventions for those with dermatological conditions. In keeping with the current literature, the author envisages a two-tier approach in the provision of such psychological interventions. Firstly, most patients with dermatology conditions may not require psychological change. Instead, they could be approached with effective doctor-patient communication skills, within a context of empathy and positive regard. At the second tier, however, based on the clinical interview, some patients may require varying degrees of psychological change in order to better manage their illness. In such a context, a dermatologist with training in psychotherapy would be required. In the absence of such a person, the patient may be referred to a psychologist or another mental health professional trained in psychotherapy."
5812352	"The aim of this study is to evaluate the outcome of heart transplantation in children surviving malignancies. Pediatric heart transplant recipients were identified using the UNOS database. Follow-up data including survival and rate of malignancy were analyzed. A total of 7169 children received heart transplants between 1987 and 2011. Of these, 107 (1.5%) survived previous malignancy treatment (group I) and 7062 (98.5%) did not have prior malignancy (group II). Survival after transplant was 92.5%, 90.6%, 80.3%, and 65% at three months, one, five, and 10 yr in group I, similar to the rate in group II (90.1%, 84.4%, 73.8%, and 57.7%). Survival after transplantation was similar between group I and children who underwent OHT secondary to cardiomyopathy in group II. The rate of post-OHT malignancy in group I was higher than that in group II (14/107(13%) vs. 386/7062 (5.4%), p = 0.001). Children who developed malignancy in group I had similar survival as children who developed malignancy in group II. Post-transplant survival is similar in children with and without pretransplant malignancy in spite of higher rate of malignancy in children with pretransplant malignancy. OHT appears to be a reasonable treatment option in children who develop end-stage heart disease after malignancy treatment."
4375502	"Abscisic acid (ABA) regulates many aspects of plant development, including seed dormancy and germination, root growth and stomatal closure. Plant SKP1 proteins are subunits of the SCF complex E3 ligases, which regulate several phytohormone signalling pathways through protein degradation. However, little is known about SKP1 proteins participating in ABA signalling. Here, we report that the overexpression of Triticum aestivum SKP1-like 1 (TSK1) in Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) resulted in delayed seed germination and hypersensitivity to ABA. The opening of stomatal guard cells and the transcription of several ABA-responsive genes were affected in transgenic plants. In contrast, Arabidopsis skp1-like 1 (ask1)/ask1 ASK2/ask2 seedlings exhibited reduced ABA sensitivity. Furthermore, the transcription of ASK1 and ASK2 was down-regulated in abi1-1 and abi5-1 mutants compared with that in wild type. ASK1 or ASK2 overexpression could rescue or partially rescue the ABA insensitivity of abi5-1 mutants, respectively. Our work demonstrates that SKP1 is involved in ABA signalling and that SKP1-like genes may positively regulate ABA signalling by SCF-mediated protein degradation."

We analyzed skin histopathology in 64 cases of lepra reaction.                                                                            To make detailed observations on histopathologic features of type 1 and type 2 lepra reaction (erythema nodosum leprosum, ENL).                                                                                            In this retrospective study, we included 64 patients diagnosed during a 3-year period as lepra reaction based on clinico-pathological co-relation.                                                                              Out of the 64 patients, 22 were of type 1 reaction and 42 of ENL. The most consistent finding in type 1 reaction was papillary dermal edema (86%) followed by pyknosis of lymphocytes (77%) and intercellular edema within granuloma (73%). Surprisingly, folliculotropism of lymphocytes was seen in 55% and subcutaneous infiltration in 36%. In ENL, the most common finding was presence of neutrophils within the granuloma (100%), followed by leukocytoclasia (81%), papillary dermal edema (81%), and neutrophilic panniculitis (69%). Fibrin in the vessel wall or/and granulomas was noted in only 38% while fibrin thrombi in the vessel walls were seen in only 12% of cases.                                                                                     Infiltration of macrophage granulomas by neutrophils is a reliable sign of ENL. Classical signs of vasculitis are not always present in ENL. Folliculotropism and lymphocytic panniculitis were frequent in type 1 reactions while neutrophilic panniculitis was common with ENL."
6629556	"Blastomycosis is a chronic granulomatous and suppurative mycosis, caused by Blastomyces dermatitidis, which in the great majority of cases presents as a primary pulmonary disease. Primary cutaneous blastomycosis is very rare. We present a 57-year-old female patient with a solitary, slowly progressive nodule over upper lip of 2½ months duration. Initially, differential diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis, pyoderma and deep mycoses were entertained. Slit smear preparation was suspicious of deep mycotic infection which was subsequently confirmed by biopsy and culture."
7037668	"This investigation was conducted to evaluate osseointegrated skin-penetrating facial titanium implants used for anchoring facial prostheses over a 5-year period and to recommend guidelines for the use of osseointegrated implants in the restorative treatment of auricular and orbital defects. The total success rate for implant survival was 95.6% in the auricular defects and 67.2% in the orbital defects. Approximately 10% of the patients will have some skin problems, whereas the remaining 90% will have no or minimal problems. The possibility of achieving osseointegration around an orbital defect is not as good as in the mastoid process. Success criteria for the use of implants in the craniofacial region are given."
3380786	"A reduced heparan sulphate (HS) expression in the glomerular basement membrane of patients with overt diabetic nephropathy is associated with an increased glomerular heparanase expression. We investigated the possible association of urinary heparanase activity with the development of proteinuria in patients with Type 1 diabetes (T1D), Type 2 diabetes (T2D), or membranous glomerulopathy (MGP) as non-diabetic disease controls.                                                                              Heparanase activity, albumin, HS and creatinine were measured in the urine of patients with T1D (n=58) or T2D (n=31), in patients with MGP (n=52) and in healthy controls (n=10). Heparanase messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in leukocytes was determined in a subgroup of patients with T1D (n=19).                                                                              Urinary heparanase activity was increased in patients with T1D and T2D, which was more prominent in patients with macroalbuminuria, whereas no activity could be detected in healthy controls. Albuminuria levels were associated with increased urinary heparanase activity in diabetic patients (r=0.20; P<   0.05) but not in patients with MGP (r=0.11; P=0.43). A lower urinary heparanase activity was observed in diabetic patients treated with inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), when compared to diabetic patients treated with other anti-hypertensives. Additionally, urinary heparanase activity was associated with age in T1D and MGP. In MGP, heparanase activity and β2-microglobulin excretion correlated. In patients with T1D, no differences in heparanase mRNA expression in leukocytes could be observed.                                                                                      Urinary heparanase activity is increased in diabetic patients with proteinuria. However, whether increased heparanase activity is a cause or consequence of proteinuria requires additional research."
4338588	"Melanocytic nevus density is a strong risk factor for cutaneous malignant melanoma. Reducing the number of nevi in children may reduce the risk of their developing melanoma as adults.                                                                                  We sought to assess the effect of sunscreen use on nevus development by anatomic sites and by nevi of different sizes for white schoolchildren in a randomized trial.                                                                              We compared the new nevus count between the sunscreen intervention group (n = 145) and the control group (n = 164) by anatomic site.                                                                              Children randomized to the sunscreen group had significantly fewer new nevi on the trunk than children in the control group. The differences were more pronounced among the freckled children than children with no freckles.                                                                                      Potential limitations to this study include relatively small numbers of enrolled children, and a follow-up period of only 3 years.

9395579	"Artificial reduction of abnormal transepidermal water loss (TEWL) is considered to improve skin diseases associated with a defective barrier function. Treatment of the skin with moisturizers is also known to influence skin barrier function. Whether or not differences in occlusion between creams contribute to their effects on the skin barrier function is unknown.                                                                                   To investigate the long-term effects of a semipermeable membrane on the skin barrier function in normal skin. In addition, the occlusive properties of two creams were studied.                                                                              The study was randomized, controlled and evaluator-blind using measurement of TEWL and skin susceptibility to sodium lauryl sulphate as indicators of skin barrier function.                                                                              Coating of the skin with a silicone membrane for 23 h per day for 3 weeks improved skin barrier function, whereas no significant changes were found after using the membrane for 8 h per day.                                                                                      Differences between creams in terms of their effect on skin barrier function cannot be solely explained by their occlusive properties."
2552925	"Bone pain after transplantation is a frequent complication that can be caused by several diseases. Treatment strategies depend on the correct diagnosis of the pain. Nine patients with severe pain in their feet, which was registered after transplantation, were investigated. Bone scans showed an increased tracer uptake of the foot bones. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated bone marrow oedema in the painful bones. Pain was not explained by other diseases causing foot pain, like reflex sympathetic dystrophy, polyneuropathy, Morton's neuralgia, gout, osteoporosis, avascular necrosis, intermittent claudication, orthopaedic foot deformities, stress fractures, and hyperparathyroidism. The reduction of cyclosporine- or tacrolimus trough levels and the administration of calcium channel blockers led to relief of pain. The Calcineurin-inhibitor Induced Pain Syndrome (CIPS) is a rare but severe side effect of cyclosporine or tacrolimus and is accurately diagnosed by its typical presentation, magnetic resonance imaging and bone scans. Incorrect diagnosis of the syndrome will lead to a significant reduction of life quality in patients suffering from CIPS."

The lattice has the external form of a plaque or band and internally consists of alternating parallel wide and narrow layers.  Filaments in wide layers run in at least two directions across the short dimension of the inclusion.  In contrast, the rodlet is a bundle of parallel filaments running the long dimension of the inclusion.  Filaments in lattices and rodlets possibly contract and agitate the highly folded nucleus of the Merkel cell."
8721692	"Solar urticaria is a rare photodermatosis probably caused by a chromophore, that - if activated by light of a specific spectrum - binds to mast cell-bound IgE and elicits degranulation. In our patient an action spectrum in ultraviolet A and visible light range was found, in the autologous serum test the presence of a serum chromophore for the same action spectra could be demonstrated, which may underline this pathogenetic hypothesis. Symptoms did not improve using antihistamines and sun protection. Photo hardening was denied from the patient, immunosuppression and plasmapheresis were discussed but not considered. So a treatment with Omalizumab was started that recently was successfully used in 4 case reports. After 3 doses of Xolair® there was no changing in the phototesting results and after 4 doses no subjective improvement."
9778183	"Our aim was to study the impact of subclinical inflammation on the development of interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IF/TA) on a 1-year protocol biopsy in patients on rapid steroid withdrawal (RSW). A total of 256 patients were classified based on protocol biopsy findings at months 1 or 4. Group 1 is 172 patients with no inflammation, group 2 is 50 patients with subclinical inflammation (SCI), group 3 is 19 patients with subclinical acute rejection (SAR) and group 4 is 15 patients with clinical acute rejection (CAR). On the 1-year biopsy, more patients in group 2 (SCI) (34%, p = 0.004) and group 3 (SAR) (53%, p = 0.0002), had an IF/TA score >    2 compared to group 1 (control) (15%). IF/TA was not increased in group 4 (CAR) (20%). The percent with IF/TA score >    2 and interstitial inflammation (Banff i score >    0) was higher in group 2 (16%, p = 0.004) and group 3 (37%, p <    0.0001) compared to group 1 (3%). In a multivariate analysis, patients in groups 2 or 3 had a higher risk of IF/TA score >    2 on the 1-year biopsy (OR 6.62, 95% CI 2.68-16.3). We conclude that SCI and SAR increase the risk of developing IF/TA in patient on RSW."
5713291	"UVA1 constitutes around 75% of the terrestrial UV radiation, and most of the output of artificial tanning sources. However, the molecular effects of UVA1 in human skin in vivo are surprisingly poorly understood. We have examined time-dependent whole-genome expression, along with mRNA and protein changes in the skin after one minimal erythema dose of spectrally pure UVA1 (50 J cm(-2)) and 300 nm UVB (30 mJ cm(-2)). After 24 hours, the genes induced to the greatest extent were those involved in extracellular matrix remodeling with both UVA1 (P=5.5e-7) and UVB (P=2.9e-22). UVA1 and UVB caused different effects on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression: UVB induced MMP1, MMP3, and MMP10 mRNA at 24 hours to a much greater extent than UVA1. MMP12 induction by UVA1 at 6 hours is marked and much greater than that by UVB. We have found that MMP12 mRNA induction by UVA1 resulted in expression of MMP12 protein, which is functional as an elastase. This induction of elastase activity did not occur with UVB. We hypothesize that the UVA1 induction of MMP12 mediates some of its photoaging effects, particularly by contributing to elastin degeneration in late solar elastosis. MMP12 is a good marker of UVA1 exposure."
9352023	"Plants of Pinguicula lusitanica were grown in individual Erlenmeyer flasks on an inorganic agar medium containing no nitrogen or phosphorus. After 8 weeks of culture, twenty of the plants were fed Pinus pollen 4 times over a period of 5 weeks.As a result of the feeding, the number of leaves as well as the diameters of the rosettes were increased. The leaves became turned a deeper green and aged more slowly.The most spectacular effect of the pollen feeding was an initiation of flowering. The first buds were already visible after the second feeding. All of the treated plants flowered before the last feeding, whereas none of the untreated plants flowered. During the following 6 months, the treated plants developed 127 flowers, the largest number on a single specimen being 14. Even after this period of time the untreated plants remained vegetative."
2880037	"As the incidence of cutaneous melanoma continues to rise, more individuals will be at risk for developing second primary melanomas. We hypothesize that patient education and follow-up surveillance will lead to the early detection of subsequent primary melanomas as demonstrated by a decrease in Breslow thickness at diagnosis.                                                                              A computer-based investigation was performed to identify patients who had developed a second primary melanoma following treatment of in situ and American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC) Stage I or II melanoma. Patients are routinely educated on the increased risk of developing a second primary lesion and characteristic clinical features of melanoma. Patient surveillance was performed on a regular basis. Differences in Breslow thickness between the initial and subsequent primary melanomas were analyzed by a paired t-test.                                                                              Among 877 individuals identified in the Mount Sinai School of Medicine Department of Dermatopathology database with in situ or AJCC Stage I or II melanoma, 111 developed a second primary melanoma. The mean thickness was 0.239 +/- 0.661 mm for the initial melanoma and 0.1135 +/- 0.319 mm for the subsequent melanoma. By paired t-test, the difference in tumor thickness was statistically significant (P = 0.019).                                                                                      Upon analysis of our data, subsequent primary cutaneous melanomas were found to be significantly thinner than initial primary melanomas at the time of diagnosis. This suggests that earlier diagnosis may be the result of patient education and careful follow up. Counselling on the risk of developing a second primary melanoma, education regarding clinical characteristics of melanoma, and routine lifelong follow up should be provided to all patients diagnosed with a cutaneous melanoma."
1012300	"Transition metals such as iron, copper, zinc, or molybdenum are essential nutrients for plants. These elements are involved in almost every biological process, including photosynthesis, tolerance to biotic and abiotic stress, or symbiotic nitrogen fixation. However, plants often grow in soils with limiting metallic oligonutrient bioavailability. Consequently, to ensure the proper metal levels, plants have developed a complex metal uptake and distribution system, that not only involves the plant itself, but also its associated microorganisms. These microorganisms can simply increase metal solubility in soils and making them more accessible to the host plant, as well as induce the plant metal deficiency response, or directly deliver transition elements to cortical cells. Other, instead of providing metals, can act as metal sinks, such as endosymbiotic rhizobia in legume nodules that requires relatively large amounts to carry out nitrogen fixation. In this review, we propose to do an overview of metal transport mechanisms in the plant-microbe system, emphasizing the role of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and endosymbiotic rhizobia."
5292482	"The EXO (EXORDIUM) gene was identified as a potential mediator of brassinosteroid (BR)-promoted growth. It is part of a gene family with eight members in Arabidopsis. EXO gene expression is under control of BR, and EXO overexpression promotes shoot and root growth. In this study, the consequences of loss of EXO function are described.                                                                              The exo loss of function mutant showed diminished leaf and root growth and reduced biomass production. Light and scanning electron microscopy analyses revealed that impaired leaf growth is due to reduced cell expansion. Epidermis, palisade, and spongy parenchyma cells were smaller in comparison to the wild-type. The exo mutant showed reduced brassinolide-induced cotyledon and hypocotyl growth. In contrast, exo roots were significantly more sensitive to the inhibitory effect of synthetic brassinolide. Apart from reduced growth, exo did not show severe morphological abnormalities. Gene expression analyses of leaf material identified genes that showed robust EXO-dependent expression. Growth-related genes such as WAK1, EXP5, and KCS1, and genes involved in primary and secondary metabolism showed weaker expression in exo than in wild-type plants. However, the vast majority of BR-regulated genes were normally expressed in exo. HA- and GFP-tagged EXO proteins were targeted to the apoplast.                                                                                     The EXO gene is essential for cell expansion in leaves. Gene expression patterns and growth assays suggest that EXO mediates BR-induced leaf growth. However, EXO does not control BR-levels or BR-sensitivity in the shoot. EXO presumably is involved in a signalling process which coordinates BR-responses with environmental or developmental signals. The hypersensitivity of exo roots to BR suggests that EXO plays a diverse role in the control of BR responses in the root."
1167571	"Microbial glycans, such as bacterial peptidoglycans, fungal chitin or rhizobacterial Nod factors (NFs), are important signatures for plant immune activation or for the establishment of beneficial symbioses. Plant lysin motif (LysM) domain proteins serve as modules mediating recognition of these different N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)-containing ligands, suggesting that this class of proteins evolved from an ancient sensor for GlcNAc. During early plant evolution, these glycans probably served as immunogenic patterns activating LysM protein receptor-mediated plant immunity and stopping microbial infection. The biochemical potential of plant LysM proteins for sensing microbial GlcNAc-containing glycans has probably since favored the evolution of receptors facilitating microbial infection and symbiosis."

Eighteen male adult rabbits underwent bilateral maxillary sinus augmentation with particulate bovine hydroxyapatite to be divided into three groups, as follows: Group C - control, no membrane; Group RR - rapid resorbable collagen membrane; and Group SR - slow-resorbable collagen membrane. The animals were euthanized after 30 and 120 days for specimen's removal to be prepared and analyzed under light microscopy, histomorphometry, and immunohistochemistry for Runx2 and VEGF labeling.                                                                              Histopathology evaluation presented similar healing pattern among the groups with a satisfactory response of SM, both at day 30 and day 120. Bone histomorphometry did not reveal significant differences among the groups, as well as immunohistochemistry analysis, which presented intense immunolabeling for both proteins in all groups.                                                                                      The presence of both membranes did not negatively interfere in bone formation and remodeling, and the focal mild inflammatory reaction caused by their degrading process did not impair the reconstructive procedure."
1882126	"The purpose of the study is to evaluate patterns of employment and alcohol use among liver transplant recipients with alcoholic (ALD) and nonalcoholic liver disease (non-ALD). MEDLINE, EMBASE, and bibliographic searches identified 5,505 potentially relevant articles published between January 1966 and October 1998. Eighty-two studies reporting data on 5,020 transplant recipients met our inclusion criteria. Pre-orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), 29% of transplant recipients with ALD and 59% of those with non-ALD worked versus 33% and 80% at 3 years for transplant recipients with ALD and non-ALD, respectively (P <   .00001 for each interval). We found no difference in the proportion of transplant recipients with ALD and non-ALD reporting early alcohol use post-OLT: 4% versus 5% at 6 months and 17% versus 16% at 12 months. However, among post-OLT drinkers, transplant recipients with non-ALD were more likely to drink moderately and those with ALD to drink excessively. At 7 years post-OLT, 32% of the patients with ALD reported using alcohol. The odds ratio for alcohol use among patients who maintained abstinence for fewer than 6 months pre-OLT versus those who maintained abstinence for greater than 6 months was 7.8 (95% confidence interval, 4.0 to 15.3). Before OLT and at long-term follow-up, substantially more transplant recipients with non-ALD than ALD were employed. The proportions of transplant recipients with ALD and non-ALD reporting alcohol use did not differ, although those with ALD tended to consume greater quantities."

Persistent infestation could be diagnosed only after cutting the hair and combing repeatedly, which allowed visualization of juvenile (nymphal) and adult lice. Insecticide-resistant headlouse infestations are probably much more common than is generally realised and may persist unnoticed, so that more aggressive approaches will be needed to eradicate these ectoparasites from individuals and communities."
2949380	"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is a treatment option for relapsed anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) in children, but reports on its efficacy in this disease are still limited. We analyzed data concerning 34 patients under 18 years of age prospectively registered in the French SFGM-TC database, who had undergone an allo-SCT for the treatment of ALK+ ALCL between 1993 and 2011. At transplant, 28 patients (82.4%) were in CR, whereas 6 exhibited detectable disease. Conditioning regimens were mostly myelo-ablative (n=31). With a median follow-up of 6 years, 5-year overall and event-free survival rates were 70% (SE=8%) and 58% (SE=9%), respectively. The 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse and treatment-related mortality was 18% (SE=7%) and 24% (SE=8%), respectively. Six patients had relapsed (median time, 141 days (35-235)). A durable CR had been obtained in 4/6 patients after injection of donor lymphocytes (n=1) or vinblastine-corticosteroid therapy (n=3). Ten patients had died, eight due to transplant toxicity and two due to progressive disease. Allo-SCT is an efficient treatment for pediatric patients with high-risk relapsed ALK+ ALCL. However, the overall morbidity of allo-SCT raises questions about its place, given the efficacy of targeted agents currently under development in this disease."
7804280	"The first case demonstrating the association of a port wine stain with pneumosinus dilatans was reported in 2003 by Dogan B et al. The current study is an extension of that case report, attempting to demonstrate that the association of pneumosinus dilatans and port wine stain is clinically significant and warrants clinical evaluation in patients with port wine stains. We aimed to evaluate the patients with or without facial port wine stains if they had pneumosinus dilatans. Twenty-three patients with port-wine stains, and 20 controls without port wine stains were compared. Facial CT scan were performed on each of the 43 subjects and analysed for radiological evidence of pneumosinus dilatans. A grading system was used to assess the extent of sinus enlargement noted on CT. Statistical analysis was also done. Ten out of 20 controls had minimal enlargement, 22 out of 23 patients with a port-wine stain had minimal to marked enlargement. The differences of having pneumosinus dilatans or not and the severity of enlargement between controls and patients were statistically significant (p=0.001; p=0.00001 respectively) This study showed that the association of port wine stain and pneumosinus dilatans was not a coincidence and the diminished density of peristructural nerves might be the common cause of these two pathological conditions, especially when they are together."
9314170	"The objective of this study was to analyze the importance of the quality of the vascular segment to be cryopreserved and the influence of storage in a gas phase, a liquid phase, or after accidental immersion in liquid nitrogen. In addition, we investigated the effects of rapid versus slow thawing on the occurrence of fractures and changes in the structure of the vessel wall. The tissue sources were whole thoracic and abdominal aortas from 15 pigs. Each aorta was cut into equal segments and randomly assigned to each study group. One segment of fresh unfrozen aorta of the same size was used as a control. The samples were cryopreserved using a programmed apparatus. After 2 weeks the arterial segments were thawed rapidly or slowly. A great variation in the results was obtained depending on the quality of the control. Although endothelial cells were better preserved in the liquid phase, the internal elastic lamina and elastic lamelli showed better preservation and fewer microfractures in the gas phase. The internal elastic lamina showed a greater number of microfractures when an accidental immersion in liquid nitrogen had taken place. Furthermore, better preservation of the structure of the vascular segment was observed with a slow thawing method. In general, the conditions of storage and the method of thawing seem to damage the structure of vascular segments. It is necessary to use a severe protocol of donor and vascular segment selection to optimize the post-thaw quality of the cryopreserved samples."

A total of 740 subjects aged 40 to 91 years participated in the survey between April 10, 2005, and June 12, 2005.                                                                                            Norwood and Ludwig classifications were used to assess the degree of hair loss. Information on smoking, together with other possible risk factors and age at onset of AGA, was collected using a questionnaire interview.                                                                              After controlling for age and family history, statistically significant positive associations were noted between moderate or severe AGA (Norwood types >    or =IV) and smoking status (odds ratio [OR], 1.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14-2.76), current cigarette smoking of 20 cigarettes or more per day (OR, 2.34; 95% CI, 1.19-4.59), and smoking intensity (OR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.03-3.07). The OR of early-onset history for AGA grades increased in a dose-response pattern. Risk for moderate or severe AGA increased for family history of first-degree and second-degree relatives, as well as for paternal relatives.                                                                                      The age-specific prevalence of AGA in Taiwan was compatible to that among Korean men but was lower than that among persons of white race/ethnicity. Smoking status, current amount of cigarette smoking, and smoking intensity were statistically significant factors responsible for AGA after controlling for age and family history. Patients with early-onset AGA should receive advice early to prevent more advanced progression."

To determine the best modality for systemic corticosteroid use in terms of their efficacy, relapse rate, and side effects.                                                                              Fifty-one patients with single or multiple AA (AA/multiplex) and 38 patients with alopecia totalis or AA universalis (AA totalis/universalis) were enrolled in this open study. They were randomly divided into three groups depending on the time of their initial visit. They were administered (1) oral dexamethasone (Dex) 0.5 mg/day for 6 months (Dex group), (2) intramuscular triamcinolone acetonide (imTA) 40 mg once a month for 6 months followed by 40 mg once every 1.5 months for 1 year (imTA group), and (3) pulse therapy (PT) using oral predonine 80 mg for 3 consecutive days once every 3 months (PT group). After the treatment, each treatment modality was evaluated by the response rate, relapse rate, and side effect profile.                                                                              The response rate of AA/multiplex was significantly better in the imTA group than in the Dex group. The overall relapse rate and that of AA totalis/universalis were significantly better in the PT group than in the Dex group. Dysmenorrhea was the most common and problematic side effect. Impairment of the adrenocortical reserve was seen in 7% of the PT group and 23% of the imTA group, which was recovered without any further medical treatment.                                                                                     imTA or pulse therapy is effective for AA and has an acceptable level of side effects. The development of a new strategy to reduce the relapse rate is needed."

To derive data about the prevalence and predictive factors of acne, the disability caused by acne and choice of treatment used by Chinese late adolescents in Hong Kong.                                                                              This was a cross-sectional study of a random sample of 389 entrants in a university in Hong Kong, using the Global Acne Grading System (GAGS) to measure the clinical severity of acne and the Cardiff Acne Disability Index (CADI) to measure QOL.                                                                              The response rate was 99.3%. The prevalence of acne was of 81.5% (95% CI 77.6-85.4%) and coexisted with a high frequency of acne disability at a rate of 81.8% (95% CI 78.1-85.6%). Assessment of the clinical severity of acne did not correlate strongly with the effect on QOL (gamma(s) = 0.445, P <    0.001). Over the previous 6 months, 30.3% of subjects had used topical treatments, 3.9% had taken systemic conventional western drugs and 3.2% of the subjects had used traditional Chinese medicine. Multivariate logistic regression was used to explore the predictive factors for acne disability. Female gender (P = 0.002), higher GAGS score (P <    0.001), higher perceived stress (P = 0.01) and willingness to pay Hong Kong$15,000 (970 pounds) for a hypothetical permanent cure (P = 0.03) were positive predictors.                                                                                      Acne is prevalent in Hong Kong and has considerable psychological effects. The association between clinical severity and impaired QOL is not strong."
9159571	"Low-elevation surveys with small aerial drones (micro-unmanned aerial vehicles [UAVs]) may be used for a wide variety of applications in plant ecology, including mapping vegetation over small- to medium-sized regions. We provide an overview of methods and procedures for conducting surveys and illustrate some of these applications.                                                                              Aerial images were obtained by flying a small drone along transects over the area of interest. Images were used to create a composite image (orthomosaic) and a digital surface model (DSM). Vegetation classification was conducted manually and using an automated routine. Coverage of an individual species was estimated from aerial images.                                                                              We created a vegetation map for the entire region from the orthomosaic and DSM, and mapped the density of one species. Comparison of our manual and automated habitat classification confirmed that our mapping methods were accurate. A species with high contrast to the background matrix allowed adequate estimate of its coverage.                                                                                     The example surveys demonstrate that small aerial drones are capable of gathering large amounts of information on the distribution of vegetation and individual species with minimal impact to sensitive habitats. Low-elevation aerial surveys have potential for a wide range of applications in plant ecology."

We herewith report a 55-year-old man who has disseminated cutaneous rhinosporidiosis. He presents with multiple reddish lesions over the nose of 10 year's duration. In the past year, he develops skin lesions over the right arm and over back. Histopathological examination of the skin biopsy specimen from the representative cutaneous lesions shows hyperplastic epithelium with numerous globular cysts of varying shape, representing sporangia in different stages of development. His serology for HIV infection by ELISA is negative. On the basis of these clinical and histopathological findings, a diagnosis of nasal rhinosporidiosis with cutaneous dissemination is made."

Randomized controlled trial with immediate and 4-month follow-up visits.                                                                              Clinical offices in the ambulatory care area of a hospital. Patients The study included 130 participants and their cohabiting partners drawn from a melanoma registry. Intervention The subjects were randomly assigned to receive the intervention either as solo learning or as dyadic learning. The intervention consisted of a 10-minute demonstration of the ABCDE (asymmetry of shape, border irregularity, color variegation, diameter >    or =6 mm, and evolution of the lesion) rule and skills training.                                                                                            Behavioral measures included self-reported performance of SSE and use of a body map designed to record areas of concern found during SSE. Intentions, along with attitudinal measures such as perceived importance of SSE and self-efficacy in performing SSE, were also assessed at the 4-month follow-up visit.                                                                              The participants in the dyadic learning group were significantly more likely to report engaging in SSE behaviors (P<   .05). The dyadic learning group also exhibited greater intentions to perform future SSE (P<   .01), higher perceived importance of SSE (P<   .01), and higher perceived self-efficacy (P<   .01).

7922030	"We report on a 32-year-old female patient undergoing peritoneal dialysis for diabetic nephropathy who developed blisters and cutaneous fragility on the dorsa of the hands. Histopathology of an early lesion showed a subepidermal cleft under a regular epidermis with single necrotic keratinocytes and normal dermal structures. In an advanced lesion, a subepidermal bulla and caterpillar bodies were found in the epidermis. Dermal vessel walls were normal and surrounded by a discrete lymphocytic infiltrate. Direct immunofluorescence revealed perivascular deposits of C3. Uroporphyrin and coproporphyrin levels of serum, urine and dialysate were repeatedly normal, confirming pseudoporphyria. The patient took furosemide (500 mg daily). Replacement of furosemide by ethacrynic acid led to spontaneous healing of the blisters. The patient was free of further lesions at the 1-year follow-up."
4168647	"The aim of this study was to develop a tool for preoperatively predicting the need of a patient to attend an extended care facility after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). A multidisciplinary group, which included 2 transplant surgeons, 2 transplant nurses, 1 nurse manager, 2 physical therapists, 1 case manager, 1 home health care professional, 1 rehabilitation physician, and 1 statistician, met to identify preoperative factors relevant to discharge planning. The parameters that were examined as potential predictors of the discharge status were as follows: age, sex, language, Karnofsky score, OLT alone (versus a combined procedure), creatinine, bilirubin, international normalized ratio (INR), albumin, body mass index (BMI), Child-Turcotte-Pugh score, chemical Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score, renal dialysis, location before transplantation, comorbidities (encephalopathy, ascites, hydrothorax, and hepatopulmonary syndrome), diabetes mellitus (DM), cardiac ejection fraction and right ventricular systolic pressure, sex and availability of the primary caregiver, donor risk index, and donor characteristics. Between January 2004 and April 2010, 730 of 777 patients (94%) underwent only liver transplantation, and 47 patients (6%) underwent combined procedures. Five hundred nineteen patients (67%) were discharged home, 215 (28%) were discharged to a facility, and 43 (6%) died early after OLT. A multivariate logistic regression analysis identified the following parameters as significantly influencing the discharge status: a low Karnofsky score, an older age, female sex, an INR of 2.0, a creatinine level of 2.0 mg/dL, DM, a high bilirubin level, a low albumin level, a low or high BMI, and renal dialysis before OLT. The nomogram was prospectively validated with a population of 126 OLT recipients with a concordance index of 0.813. In conclusion, a new approach to improving the efficiency of hospital care is essential. We believe that this tool will aid in reducing lengths of stay and improving the experience of patients by facilitating early discharge planning."
9805264	"Mitogen activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) signal transduction pathways are important eukaryotic mechanisms for regulating cellular responses to stress. The objective of this work was to investigate the role of the barley MAP kinase HvMPK4 (a homologue of the Arabidopsis MAP kinase AtMPK1) in the plant response to biotic and abiotic stress. Transgenic barley plants bearing antisense or overexpression constructs for HvMPK4 were produced, and RNA blot analysis showed that HvMPK4 gene expression was much reduced in the antisense lines and approximately double in the overexpression lines. Three independent lines of each construct were tested for their response to a fungal pathogen and to salt treatment. The antisense lines were more resistant to the hemibiotrophic fungal pathogen Magnaporthe grisea, and showed enhanced levels of salicylic acid (SA) and of hydrogen peroxide following infection; HvMPK4 is thus a negative regulator of SA production post infection. The overexpression lines had constitutively higher levels of jasmonic acid and enhanced levels of ethylene following infection but were not more resistant to the pathogen. However the overexpression lines showed greater tolerance to abiotic stress, as following 2 weeks of salt treatment these lines showed less reduction in fresh and dry weight, accumulated less salt in the leaves and contained enhanced levels of the osmoprotectant amino acid, proline."
6975635	"A strain of Penicillium notatum has been found growing upon media containing saturated calcium acetate which upon passage through media containing saturated KC1 loses its ability to grow at normal rates in salt-free glucose-peptone medium. This salt-habituated form can be restored to a near-normal growth rate by adding yeast extract, RNA or RNA-hydrolysates, but not by DNA or its hydrolysate. The 4 RNA nucleotides in combination replace yeast extract whereas riboside and base combinations do not. Adenylic, guanylic or cytidilic acids, singly or in various combinations, are even more effective, but uridylic acid alone is not active at all. Ribonucleotide pairs including uridylic acid are less active, but 3 ribonucleotide combinations are highly effective, even in the presence of uridylic acid. Differential effects were evident in mycelial form and sporulation, as well as growth. In addition to a direct role in Penicillium RNA metabolism, the significance of ribonucleotides in energy metabolism or cell wall synthesis is mentioned as alternatives to explain their restorative effects."
1935429	"Neonatal mice deficient in IkappaB-alpha, an inhibitor of the ubiquitous transcription factor NF-kappaB, develop severe and widespread dermatitis shortly after birth. In humans, inflammatory skin disorders such as psoriasis are associated with accumulation in the skin of the unusual arachidonic acid metabolite 12R-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12R-HETE), a product of the enzyme 12R-lipoxygenase. To examine the etiology of the murine IkappaB-alpha-deficient skin phenotype, we investigated the expression of lipoxygenases and the metabolism of exogenous arachidonic acid in the skin. In the IkappaB-alpha-deficient animals, the major lipoxygenase metabolite was 8S-HETE, formed together with a minor amount of 12S-HETE; 12R-HETE synthesis was undetectable. Skin from the wild-type littermates formed 12S-HETE as the almost exclusive lipoxygenase metabolite. Upregulation of 8S-lipoxygenase (8-LOX) in IkappaB-alpha-deficient mice was confirmed at the transcriptional and translational level using ribonuclease protection assay and western analysis. In immunohistochemical studies, increased expression of 8-LOX was detected in the stratum granulosum of the epidermis. In the stratum granulosum, 8-LOX may be involved in the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes. Although mouse 8S-lipoxygenase and human 12R-lipoxygenase are not ortholog genes, we speculate that in mouse and humans the two different enzymes may fulfill equivalent functions in the progression of inflammatory dermatoses."
7710577	"Angiokeratoma corporis diffusum (ACD), initially considered to be synonymous with Fabry's disease, represents a well-known cutaneous marker of some other lysosomal enzyme disorders. Aspartylglucosaminuria (AGU) is a rare hereditary disorder mostly affecting the Finnish population, with only a few sporadic patients of non-Finnish origin. To date, only three patients with AGU have been reported with cutaneous lesions of ACD. A 19-year-old Spanish woman presented with a 10-year history of progressive ACD affecting the limbs, buttocks and trunk. After the age of 6 years she had developed progressive mental deterioration, coarse facies and macroglossia with a scrotal appearance. Peripheral blood smears showed many vacuolated lymphocytes. Enzyme analysis in cultured fibroblasts revealed a decreased activity of aspartylglucosaminidase. By the age of 31 years the patient had developed a bipolar psychosis, polycystic ovarian disease and severe impairment of cognitive skills. This is the first case of AGU detected in a Spanish patient presenting with cutaneous lesions of ACD. To our knowledge, macroglossia with a scrotal appearance and polycystic ovarian disease have not been reported in previous cases of AGU."
5530466	"Recent research has implicated nitric oxide (NO) in the induction of the hypersensitive response (HR) during plant-pathogen interactions. Here we demonstrate that Arabidopsis suspension cultures generate elevated levels of NO in response to challenge by avirulent bacteria, and, using NO donors, show that these elevated levels of NO are sufficient to induce cell death in Arabidopsis cells independently of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We also provide evidence that NO-induced cell death is a form of programmed cell death (PCD), requiring gene expression, and has a number of characteristics of PCD of mammalian cells: NO induced chromatin condensation and caspase-like activity in Arabidopsis cells, while the caspase-1 inhibitor, Ac-YVAD-CMK, blocked NO-induced cell death. A well-established second messenger mediating NO responses in mammalian cells is cGMP, produced by the enzyme guanylate cyclase. A specific inhibitor of guanylate cyclase blocked NO-induced cell death in Arabidopsis cells, and this inhibition was reversed by the cell-permeable cGMP analogue, 8Br-cGMP, although 8Br-cGMP alone did not induce cell death or potentiate NO-induced cell death. This suggests that cGMP synthesis is required but not sufficient for NO-induced cell death in Arabidopsis. In-gel protein kinase assays showed that NO activates a potential mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), although a specific inhibitor of mammalian MAPK activation, PD98059, which blocked H2O2-induced cell death, did not inhibit the effects of NO."
9639358	"1. Graft survival rates increased about 3-5 percentage points for patients with all primary diseases in 1989-1990. 2. Patients with different diseases had 1-year graft survival rates that varied from 73% for noninsulin-dependent diabetes (NIDDM) to 83% for IgA nephropathy (IgAN). Five-year graft survival varied from 40% for NIDDM to 66% for IgAN. 3. Our findings in Clinical Transplants 1990 that IgAN patients have a high graft survival was confirmed and 1-year graft survival improved by 5% in the last 2 years. 4. There was a 20 percentage point increase in full-time work status of patients after transplantation; 68% of patients with polycystic kidney disease (PKD) and chronic glomerulonephritis (CGN) had full-time work status after 3 years whereas patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and atheronephrosclerosis (NS) had about 50%. 5. Good early graft function (urine output during the first 24 hours posttransplant, no dialysis within the first-week posttransplant, and no rejection episodes before discharge), predicted good 1-year graft survival for patients with different diseases but patients with NS and DM had a poorer graft survival beyond the first year posttransplant. Patients who had poor early function had 20% lower graft survival than those who had good function. However, in patients with IgAN, no urine at day 1 still resulted in graft survival comparable to those that produced urine. 6. More patients with DM were transplanted within 1 year after going into ESRD than those with other diseases. Conversely, 46% of those with NS did not get transplanted until more than 2 years after developing ESRD. 7. Only 77% of NS patients had functioning grafts at discharge compared to DM (84%), PKD (81%), IgAN (81%), and CGN (80%). 8. Black patients had a statistically significant higher incidence of anuria on the first day compared with Whites. They also had a higher incidence of dialysis and rejection during the first hospitalization. This was true for CGN, DM, PKD, and NS patients. Following excellent early function, Black CGN and DM patients had a higher incidence of rejection than White CGN and DM patients."
6071848	"Calcium (Ca(2+)) transients have been shown to take place in response to diverse developmental and physiological cues. Also, it is involved in biotic and abiotic stress signaling. Nitric oxide (NO) is an important signaling molecule that plays a crucial role in plant growth and development, starting from germination to flowering, ripening of fruit and senescence of organs. Moreover, it plays a pivotal role in several biotic and abiotic stress signaling processes. In the present work, the ability of NO to trigger increases in cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](cyt)) was investigated. For this purpose, transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings constitutively expressing the luminescent Ca(2+)-sensitive protein apoaequorin (35S::APOAEQUORIN) was employed. In chemiluminescence and in vivo Ca(2+) imaging assays, the NO-donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) triggered a strong, instantaneous, reproducible, and dose-dependent rise in [Ca(2+)](cyt). Moreover, the observed rise in [Ca(2+)](cyt) was shown to be NO-specific and not associated with decomposition products of SNP, as the NO-scavenger 2-4-carboxyphenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3 oxide (C-PTIO) significantly blunted the observed NO-mediated spike in [Ca(2+)](cyt). Interestingly, preincubation of 35S::APOAEQUORIN Arabidopsis seedlings with the plasma membrane channel blocker lanthanum chloride resulted in partial concentration-dependent blocking of the NO-specific Ca(2+) transient. This observation indicates that, in addition to the mobilization of [Ca(2+)](cyt), as an external source in response to NO treatment, there also exists an appreciable contribution of an as yet unidentified internal pool."
3387992	"U.S. allocation policies currently place less emphasis on human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching in pediatric kidney transplant candidates to minimize dialysis time. The impact this may have on pediatric recipients after graft failure has not been extensively examined.                                                                              Using the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients database, we examined HLA sensitization after graft loss and regraft survival of all pediatric primary kidney transplant recipients younger than 18 years transplanted between 1990 and 2008, stratified by HLA-DR mismatch (MM) of first and second kidney transplant.                                                                              Of 11,916 pediatric primary kidney transplant recipients, 2704 were relisted after first graft failure. 1847 received a retransplants, and 857 remained on the waiting list. Mean % panel reactive antibody increased from 6% to 45% for retransplant and from 8% to 76% for those on the waiting list. The degree of sensitization and waiting time to retransplantation increased with DR MM at first kidney transplantation. Two DR MM statuses at first transplant were associated with a 20% reduction in the hazard of receiving a retransplant (hazard ratio, 0.80 for 2 vs. 0-1 DR MM; P<   0.001). Five-year retransplant graft survival was associated with the number of HLA MM at first and second kidney transplant. Retransplant graft survival was similar in the circumstance of a 0-1 DR MM living donor following a deceased donor, and the converse.                                                                                     In pediatric recipients, increasing number of initial HLA-DR MMs is associated with HLA sensitization, longer waiting time, decreased rate of retransplant, and decreased regraft survival. Consideration of DR matching at first transplant may mitigate these risks."
4308635	"Histology reports of skin tumour excisions frequently describe a histological margin significantly less than the planned surgical excision margin.                                                                                   A novel method of marking visible tumour margin was devised. This allowed us to evaluate the accuracy of tumour detection and to compare tissue contraction of the clinically normal perilesional skin with that of tumour tissue following excision and fixation.                                                                              Forty-four well-defined basal cell carcinomas were excised from 42 patients. The visible tumour edge was marked by scoring with a blade around its circumference prior to excision. This allowed comparison of visible and true histological tumour margin. The excision margin was carefully measured from the scored line and the tumour excised. After tissue fixation and processing the histological dimensions of tumour and perilesional margin skin were compared with the pre-excision measurements.                                                                              The tumour edge was accurately identified to within 1 mm in 67% of margins and was underestimated in only 4%. The whole specimen contracted by a mean of 14%. Skin containing tumour contracted by a mean of 11% but adjacent tumour-free skin in the same plane contracted by a mean of 19%. There was no significant effect of age and site on difference in percentage shrinkage between tumour and margin.                                                                                      We underestimated tumour extent at only 4% of margins. Tissue shrinkage was the most important factor affecting eventual histological margin. Our novel technique allowed us to demonstrate that this shrinkage is not uniform across the specimen, but is disproportionately high in the tumour-free margin. This suggests that previous estimates of margin shrinkage, based on whole-specimen contraction measurements, may have been erroneously low."
6260794	"A retrospective cohort study was conducted to determine the incidence of major infectious complications after orthotopic liver transplantation and to compare outcomes in patients receiving either cyclosporine (CsA) or FK506 (tacrolimus) as primary immunosuppression. Of 133 transplants performed in 118 patients, 124 transplant episodes were evaluated. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection (INF) and disease (DIS), deep fungal infection (DFI), and intraabdominal bacterial infections (IAI) were catalogued. The overall incidences of major infectious outcomes were: CMV INF = 33%; CMV DIS = 19%; DFI = 15%; and IAI = 25%. Cox proportional hazard analysis identified donor seropositivity, OKT3 as secondary immunosuppression and initial intensive care unit (ICU) duration as risk factors for CMV INF and DIS in the overall population. Fungal colonization was the dominant risk factor associated with deep fungal infection. A choledochojejunostomy anastomosis, the number of cellular blood products transfused at the time of transplantation surgery, and prior CMV INF were independent risk factors for both fungal colonization and deep infection. The single risk factor identified for intraabdominal bacterial infections was the number of cellular blood products transfused at the time of surgery. In the Cox proportional hazards model the relative risk (RR) for each category of infection was lower in the FK506 group (CMV: RR = .87, 95% confidence interval [C.I.] = [.32-2.4]; DFI: .58 [.13-2.6]; IAI: .51 [.15-1.7]), but the effect was not statistically significant. Survival was similar in patients receiving FK506 or CsA. CMV INF and DFI were independent predictors of death for all patients. Risk factors identified for CMV INF and DIS support the findings of others. Higher intraoperative blood product requirements and complicated intraoperative or postoperative courses increase the risk for IAI or DFI. The development of effective strategies to prevent CMV and fungal infections in liver transplant recipients remains a priority for future endeavors."
5319343	"Lithium has long been widely used in the treatment of bipolar mood disorders. Recent studies have demonstrated that lithium is able to decrease ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in the brain, kidneys, and heart. Because lithium may act on a number of stress and survival pathways, it is of great interest to explore this compound also in the setting of liver I/R injury. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of lithium in a model of liver I/R injury in rats. Chronic treatment with lithium (2 mmol/kg for 3 days before ischemia) decreased I/R injury, whereas acute treatment with a single dose of lithium (2 mmol/kg 1 hour before ischemia) did not confer any protection in a partial hepatic I/R model. Furthermore, rats subjected to chronic lithium treatment had a significantly better survival rate (60%) than saline-treated rats (27%) in a total hepatic I/R survival model. Chronic lithium treatment protected against liver I/R injury, as indicated by lower serum aminotransferase levels, fewer I/R-associated histopathological changes, lower hepatic inflammatory cytokine levels, less neutrophil infiltration, and lower hepatic high-mobility group box expression and serum levels. The mechanism of action of lithium appears to involve its ability to inhibit glycogen synthase kinase 3β activation, modulate mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, inhibit hepatic apoptosis, and induce autophagy. On the basis of these data, we conclude that lithium treatment may be a simple and applicable preconditioning intervention for protecting against liver I/R injury."
1374465	"Previous studies that described the long-term quality of life of living kidney donors were conducted in single centers, and lacked data on a healthy nondonor comparison group. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to compare the quality of life of 203 kidney donors with 104 healthy nondonor controls using validated scales (including the SF36, 15D and feeling thermometer) and author-developed questions. Participants were recruited from nine transplant centers in Canada, Scotland and Australia. Outcomes were assessed a median of 5.5 years after the time of transplantation (lower and upper quartiles of 3.8 and 8.4 years, respectively). 15D scores (scale of 0 to 1) were high and similar between donors and nondonors (mean 0.93 (standard deviation (SD) 0.09) and 0.94 (SD 0.06), p = 0.55), and were not different when results were adjusted for several prognostic characteristics (p = 0.55). On other scales and author-developed questions, groups performed similarly. Donors to recipients who had an adverse outcome (death, graft failure) had similar quality of life scores as those donors where the recipient did well. Our findings are reassuring for the practice of living transplantation. Those who donate a kidney in centers that use routine pretransplant donor evaluation have good long-term quality of life."
1069222	"Simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplantation (SPK) is capable of achieving normoglycemia, as assessed by oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT), in the majority of diabetic recipients with end-stage renal disease. Despite its success over the last decade, standard ranges for OGTT after SPK are not available for comparison between studies and techniques. We examined 327 prospectively performed OGTT, undertaken in insulin-free bladder-drained SPK recipients, between 1 month and 10 yr after transplantation. Ranges of values for glucose, insulin and C-peptide were derived and areas under the time concentration curves calculated. The normal range of 2-h glucose values from SPK recipients was comparable to WHO criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus in a normal population; however, the fasting glucose fell below these levels. Fasting and area-under-the-curve (AUC) glucose were remarkably stable with time after SPK, although insulin fell with time after pancreas transplantation. These ranges may allow clinical evaluation of the endocrine function in individual SPK recipients, provide standards for comparison between different centers and techniques, and provide targets for islet transplantation."
1857304	"ClpP is a proteolytic subunit of the ATP-dependent Clp protease, which is found in chloroplasts in higher plants. Proteolytic subunits are encoded both by the chloroplast gene, clpP, and a nuclear multi gene family. We insertionally disrupted clpP by chloroplast transformation in tobacco. However, complete segregation was impossible, indicating that the chloroplast-encoded clpP gene has an indispensable function for cell survival. In the heteroplasmic clpP disruptant, the leaf surface was rough by clumping, and the lateral leaf expansion was irregularly arrested, which led to an asymmetric, slender leaf shape. Chloroplasts consisted of two populations: chloroplasts that were similar to the wild type, and small chloroplasts that emitted high chl fluorescence. Ultrastructural analysis of chloroplast development suggested that clpP disruption also induced swelling of the thylakoid lumen in the meristem plastids and inhibition of etioplast development in the dark. In mature leaves, thylakoid membranes of the smaller chloroplast population consisted exclusively of large stacks of tightly appressed membranes. These results indicate that chloroplast-encoded ClpP is involved in multiple processes of chloroplast development, including a housekeeping function that is indispensable for cell survival."
7462443	"Skin cancer in darker skin is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. We sought to assess the clinical characteristics of cutaneous malignancy amongst Hispanic skin cancer patients and compare them to age-matched non-Hispanic Caucasians. In this retrospective study, 150 Hispanic skin cancer patients were identified from electronic medical records and age-matched to 150 non-Hispanic Caucasian controls with skin cancer. The incidence of actinic keratoses (AKs) in Hispanic skin cancer patients (34.0%) was statistically lower than age-matched non-Hispanic Caucasian skin cancer controls (61.3%, P <   0.001; odds ratio, 3.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.92 - 4.93). Moreover, non-Hispanic Caucasian SCC (squamous cell cancer) controls were much more likely to report AKs (36.1%, P = 0.003) than Hispanic SCC patients (25.0%, P = 0.19). This study illustrates a lower incidence of AKs in Hispanic skin cancer patients as compared to their age-matched non-Hispanic Caucasians. The Hispanic skin malignancies present at a more advanced state and there is usually a lack of awareness in such cases. Therefore, patient knowledge and education is crucial for early detection and prevention of skin cancer in the Hispanic population."
3031378	"The association between lung cancer and eczema remains controversial. Previous studies have yielded conflicting results. This retrospective population-based cohort study is aimed at clarifying the risk of lung cancer associated with eczema.                                                                                           By using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, we identified 43,719 patients who had been newly diagnosed with eczema in the years 2000 to 2010. The comparison cohort included 87,438 randomly selected, age-matched patients without eczema. The cases of these two cohorts were followed until 2011. The Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to calculate the risk of lung cancer in eczema patients. The database did not contain any information regarding smoking, alcohol consumption, socioeconomic status, or family history.                                                                              After adjusting for age and comorbidity, the population with eczema had a 2.80-fold greater risk of developing lung cancer compared with the population in the comparison cohort (adjusted hazard ratio 2.80, 95 % confidence interval 2.59-3.03). Eczema patients with comorbid diseases including asthma, chronic obstructive -pulmonary disease, alcoholic liver damage, or diabetes were at a higher risk of lung cancer compared with the non-eczema patients without comorbidity.                                                                                      Eczema is associated with a greater risk for the development of lung cancer. Further studies with more comprehensive information on potential confounders are warranted."
2704369	"Neutral/Alkaline invertases are unique to plant and photosynthetic bacteria. The function of Neutral/Alkaline invertases in plant development is not clear so far. In this study, we isolated an Arabidopsis (Col-0) mutant insensitive to osmotic stress-induced inhibition on lateral root growth. Map-based cloning reveals that a neutral invertase gene (AtCYT-INV1) was point-mutated. The mutant Atcyt-inv1 showed short primary root, smaller size of leaves and siliques, and promotion of the reproductive compared to the wild type (WT). Carbohydrate measurement showed that sucrose is accumulated and glucose is reduced in the mutant Atcyt-inv1 under normal and 3% mannitol treatments. Taken together, AtCYT-INV1 plays multiple roles in plant development and is involved in osmotic stress-induced inhibition on lateral root growth by controlling the concentration of hexose in cells."
2014628	"A proteomic approach is undertaken aiming at the identification of novel proteins involved in the alkaloid biosynthesis of Catharanthus roseus. The C. roseus cell suspension culture A11 accumulates the terpenoid indole alkaloids strictosidine, ajmalicine and vindolinine. Cells were grown for 21 days, and alkaloid accumulation was monitored during this period. After a rapid increase between day 3 and day 6, the alkaloid content reached a maximum on day 16. Systematic analysis of the proteome was performed by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After day 3, the proteome started to change with an increasing number of protein spots. On day 13, the proteome changed back to roughly the same as at the start of the growth cycle. 88 protein spots were selected for identification by mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS/MS). Of these, 58 were identified, including two isoforms of strictosidine synthase (EC 4.3.3.2), which catalyzes the formation of strictosidine in the alkaloid biosynthesis; tryptophan synthase (EC 4.1.1.28), which is needed for the supply of the alkaloid precursor tryptamine; 12-oxophytodienoate reductase, which is indirectly involved in the alkaloid biosynthesis as it catalyzes the last step in the biosynthesis of the regulator jasmonic acid. Unique sequences were found, which may also relate to unidentified biosynthetic proteins."
6018932	"Itch is the cardinal symptom of atopic dermatitis (AD). β-Endorphin, a neuropeptide, is increased in both AD skin and sera. Interleukin (IL)-31, an itch-relevant cytokine, activates IL-31 receptors in keratinocytes. However, how IL-31 and β-endorphin interact in AD skin remains elusive.                                                                                   To investigate the mechanistic interaction of IL-31 and β-endorphin in AD.                                                                              This was a prospective cross-sectional study. We recruited adult patients with AD and controls according to Hanifin's AD criteria. Serum levels of IL-31 and β-endorphin were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Expressions of IL-31 receptor A (IL-31RA) and β-endorphin in the skin were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Their expression in the skin and blood was compared and correlated in patients with AD and in controls. We also treated primary keratinocytes with IL-31 and measured calcium influx, β-endorphin production and signalling pathways to define their mechanistic interactions.                                                                              β-Endorphin was increased in the supernatant from IL-31-treated keratinocytes. IL-31 receptor activation resulted in calcium influx and STAT3 activation; pretreatment with STAT3 inhibitor stopped the increase of β-endorphin. Notably, either replacement of extracellular calcium or treatment with 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, an inhibitor for the store-operated channel, blocked STAT3 activation. We found higher levels of blood β-endorphin and IL-31, which were significantly correlated, in patients with AD. Moreover, IL-31RA and β-endorphin were increased and colocalized both in AD human skin and TPA-painted mouse skin.                                                                                      IL-31 receptor activation in keratinocytes induces calcium influx and STAT3-dependent production of β-endorphin. These results might contribute to an understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying peripheral itch."
3158229	"Bud and shoot formation and regeneration of complete plants have been achieved with immature and mature leaflets, at various frequency, under the influence of a range of cytokinin and auxin combinations. Immature leaflets, 0.9 to 1.8 mm in length, produced shoots in 26 to 38% explants on a medium containing 10.0 μM BA and NAA, IBA or IAA. A reduction in the frequency of bud and shoot regeneration to 7% in the presence of 10.0 μM each of BA + NAA was observed with mature leaflets. In the differentiation of buds and shoots, no stimulating effect of GA(3) has been observed. Combinations of cytokinins with picloram and 2,4-D suppressed organogenesis. Plant regeneration was influenced by genotype and temperatures. Seed-derived progeny of regenerants contained the normal diploid number of chromosomes (2n = 14). Analysis of four isozymes, esterase, GDH, 6-PGD, and LAP, as well as nine genetically defined morphological characters indicated retention of genetic stability in the progeny of tisssue culture propagules."
3297762	"A rapid, in vivo measurement of the penetration of antiviral compounds into the skin would improve our ability to predict the therapeutic efficacy of topical treatments for herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. We have studied the concentration of iododeoxyuridine (IDU) in the stratum corneum of guinea pig skin by tape stripping at different time points after single and multiple topical doses of the drug. These results were correlated with the efficacy of topical IDU against an experimental cutaneous HSV infection. Ten adhesive tape strippings were performed on depilated guinea pig dorsum in vivo at serial intervals after a single topical dose of [3H]IDU. Iododeoxyuridine levels in the stratum corneum peaked at 1-3 h (67-70 mg/g of tissue) and then gradually declined over the next 3-24 h. We hypothesized that the peak IDU stratum corneum concentration would correlate with therapeutic efficacy. Accordingly, we determined the quantity of IDU in guinea pig stratum corneum 2 h after a topical application of seven different concentrations of IDU in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and examined the in vivo efficacy of these formulations in an experimental dorsal cutaneous HSV-1 infection in guinea pigs. The results showed an excellent correlation between the quantity of IDU in the stratum corneum and reduction in lesion severity (r = 0.95-0.97). Fifteen percent IDU in DMSO provided the highest therapeutic efficacy (90-94%). We also studied the relationship between the clinical efficacy of different dosing frequencies and the amount of IDU in the stratum corneum. Serial IDU stratum corneum concentrations were measured over 24 h following 1, 2, 3, or 4 applications per day of 1, 3, and 15% IDU in DMSO treatments and parallel efficacy studies of the different regimens were conducted in the animal model. Within each dosing frequency, the cumulative amount of drug in the stratum corneum correlated with the strength of the test formulation and with efficacy in the animal model. For each of the three formulations, increasing the number of daily doses from one up to three led to progressive increases in cumulative stratum corneum IDU levels and clinical efficacy. An increase in the number of daily applications to four had little effect on drug efficacy and was associated with a plateau in stratum corneum IDU levels. Stratum corneum IDU concentrations were rapid and easy to determine and correlated well with clinical events.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
5458400	"Eosinophilic pustular folliculitis is a rare disorder that is characterized by recurrent crops of papules and pustules localized on seborrheic areas of the body. The etiopathogenesis of the disease is still unknown, but it has been related to infections and immunosuppressive states.

3744808	"A plant-derived 0.3 kb constitutive promoter was obtained from AtTCTP expression analysis, and successfully applied to the expression of a selectable marker gene for production of transgenic creeping bentgrass plants. The isolation and use of an efficient promoter is essential to develop a vector system for efficient genetic transformation of plants, and constitutive promoters are particularly useful for the expression of selectable marker genes. In this study, we characterized a small size of the constitutive promoter from the expression analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana translationally controlled tumor protein (AtTCTP) gene. Histochemical and fluorometric GUS analyses revealed that a 303 bp upstream region from the start codon of the AtTCTP gene showed strong GUS expression throughout all plant tissues, which is approximately 55 % GUS activity compared with the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (35Spro). To examine the possible application of this promoter for the development of genetically engineered crops, we introduced pCAMBIA3301 vector harboring the 0.3 kb promoter of AtTCTP (0.3kbpro) that was fused to the herbicide resistance BAR gene (0.3kb pro ::BAR) into creeping bentgrass. Our transformation results demonstrate that transgenic creeping bentgrass plants with herbicide resistance were successfully produced using 0.3kb pro ::BAR as a selectable marker. Northern blot analysis revealed that the transgenic plants with 0.3kb pro ::BAR showed reduced but comparable expression levels of BAR to those with 35S pro ::BAR. Moreover, the transcription activity of the 0.3 kb promoter could be increased by the fusion of an enhancer sequence. These results indicate that the 0.3 kb AtTCTP promoter can be used as a plant-derived constitutive promoter for the expression of selectable marker genes, which facilitates its use as an alternative to the 35S promoter for developing genetically engineered crops."
7931630	"Both American and Canadian residency accreditation bodies have formal requirements in core competencies that include training in ethics and professionalism without prescribing content. A structured seminar series in medical ethics and professionalism relating to dermatology practice was started at Brown Medical School's dermatology residency in 2001. Methods of instruction include discussion groups, review of medical and lay literature, book review, didactic teaching, case presentation, and informal e-mail exchange. Some of the topics that have been covered include basic medical ethics, research ethics, physician-industry relationships, truth telling, privacy and confidentiality, duty to treat, and ethical and legal issues in cosmetic dermatology, dermatologic surgery, dermatologic genetics, occupational dermatology, and pediatric dermatology. The main goals of the curriculum are to fulfill the core competency requirement in professionalism of the specialty certifying boards, introduce trainees to the cross-disciplinary literature of biomedical ethics and current ethical controversies, and encourage dialogue on ethics and professionalism among faculty, colleagues in other specialties, and dermatology trainees."
8928963	"Bispyribac sodium (BS), a pyrimidinyl carboxy herbicide, is a well-known inhibitor of acetolactate synthase (ALS) activity. ALS is an enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway for branched-chain amino acids. A mutant form of rice ALS (OsmALS [W548L/S627I]) that confers resistance to BS can be used as an in vitro selection marker gene for plant transformation. Since indica and indica-derived cultivars are thought to have lower BS sensitivity than japonica rice, the application of BS as a selectable reagent for genetic transformation in indica and indica-derived cultivars is more challenging than for japonica cultivars. In this study, callus and seedlings of eight different rice cultivars (five indica-derived cultivars, two indica cultivars and one japonica cultivar) were tested for BS sensitivity. Our study indicates for the first time that callus shows a higher sensitivity to BS than seedlings in indica and indica-derived cultivars. We used BS with OsmALS [W548L/S627I] to select transformed calli, and transgenic rice plants from indica and indica-derived cultivars were successfully obtained."
9290607	"Despite improved immunosuppression, rejection accounts for significant morbidity and mortality in children after heart transplantation. We report the incidence and outcome of rejection of 105 children (male = 50; mean age of 8.3 +/- 5.8 years) following heart transplantation between January 2002 and August 2007. A multi-variant model was constructed for risk factors associated with significant rejection. In 271.9 patient-years of follow-up, there were 23 episodes of significant rejection (>   or=3A) in 21 patients (20%). Five presented in haemodynamic collapse requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support 1.6-35.9 months after transplantation; four of five survived the rejection episode. Overall rejection episodes were more common in older children, boys and those treated with sirolimus. Whereas the risk for rejection in patients on an immunosuppression regime containing tacrolimus was significantly lower. The latter finding persisted on multivariate analysis (P <    0.002). Interestingly, none of the patients who presented with haemodynamic collapse was on mycophenolate mofetil. While our experience is of a far lower incidence of rejection than registry data, rejection remains a serious problem after paediatric heart transplantation. Sirolimus without a calcineurin inhibitor was associated with more rejection episodes, whereas tacrolimus and mycophenolate appeared to provide the best protective profile."

8668319	"Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha is considered to be an important mediator in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Increased levels and activity of this cytokine have been observed in blood and skin of patients with psoriasis. As certain allelic variants of the TNF-alpha gene are associated with increased or decreased production of TNF-alpha, the disturbed cytokine balance may be under genetic control.                                                                                   To investigate the potential association of TNF-alpha promoter alleles within subtypes of psoriasis compared with healthy controls in a northern Polish population.                                                                              We analysed 166 patients with psoriasis vulgaris (134 with type I and 32 with type II) and 65 healthy controls. The polymorphisms -238G/A and -308G/A in the promoter region of the TNF-alpha gene were typed using the amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction method.                                                                              We found that the TNF-alpha-308A allele frequency was significantly decreased among patients with early-onset psoriasis in comparison with control subjects (7.5% vs. 15.4%, P = 0.022), whereas in the same patients the frequency of the TNF-alpha-238A allele was significantly increased as compared with the controls (16.8% vs. 3.1%, P = 0.000017, odds ratio 8.79, 95% confidence interval 2.606-29.678). Patients with early-onset psoriasis with -238 genotype GA or AA were found more often among those with age at onset <    25 years in comparison with those with genotype GG (31.7% vs. 9.1%, P = 0.0312). We also found that the mean +/- SD age at onset among -238A carriers was significantly lower in comparison with that associated with the -238GG genotype (13.5 +/- 7.4 vs. 19.2 +/- 9.9 years, P = 0.0132).                                                                                      Our study confirming the association between -238 G/A TNF-alpha promoter polymorphism and early-onset psoriasis vulgaris in the northern Polish population suggests that the -238A variant may contribute not only to a predisposition to psoriasis vulgaris but also to the disease phenotype."
3610804	"Steroidal saponins are widely distributed in many plant species. Their diverse structures have resulted in a wide range of applications, including drug and medicine production. It has been suggested that the nature of the non-saccharide and oligosaccharide portions of the saponin molecule both contribute to the properties of individual saponins. Despite numerous studies on the occurrence, chemical structure, and varying pharmaceutical activities of steroidal saponins, their biosynthesis pathway is poorly understood. Glycosylation is thought to be the final step in steroidal saponin biosynthesis and it is thought to be involved in regulating the biological activities of saponins. Isolation of the glycosyltransferases that catalyze the transfer of sugar molecules to steroidal compounds will help to clarify the mechanisms that produce diverse saponins and control their activities in plants. In this study, we obtained three cDNAs encoding putative glycosyltransferases from Solanum aculeatissimum. One of the three, SaGT4A showed UDP-glucosyltransferase activity. This is the first cloned glucosyltransferase involved in steroidal saponin biosynthesis. SaGT4A catalyzes the 3-O-glucosylation of steroidal sapogenins, such as diosgenin, nuatigenin, and tigogenin. This enzyme also glucosylates steroidal alkaloids, such as solanidine, solasodine, and tomatidine. Gene expression analysis revealed that the accumulation of SaGT4A transcripts showed a unique response to wounding stress indicating the involvement of SaGT4A in plant defense system."
7413361	"We have previously described a model for bone marrow transplantation that involves preparation of the host with monoclonal antibody against class I or class II antigens instead of irradiation or cytotoxic drugs. This allows engraftment and subsequent repopulation of the host by donor tissue. We have previously reported on chimerism in the peripheral blood of P1----(P1 X P2)F1 animals. In this report, we describe the examination of the bone marrow and spleen stem cell chimerism of these antibody-facilitated (AF) chimeras, by determining, with an isozyme assay, the phenotype of methylcellulose colonies grown from stem cells. We have found a correlation between peripheral blood chimerism and the stem cell constitution of both spleen and bone marrow. The peripheral blood chimerism also correlates with the level of chimerism in macrophages derived from peritoneal exudate cells. These findings indicate that assaying the peripheral blood of such chimeras provides an excellent indication of the degree of chimerism at the stem cell level and stands in sharp contrast to the level of chimerism in certain lymphoid compartments, as described in our accompanying article."

9324666	"Transgenic tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. cv. UC82) plants expressing a benign variant of Cucumber mosaic virus satellite RNA (CMV Tfn-satRNA) were generated. The transformed plants did not produce symptoms when challenged with a satRNA-free strain of CMV (CMV-FL). The same plant lines initially were susceptible to necrosis elicited by a CMV strain supporting a necrogenic variant of satRNA (CMV-77), but a phenotype of total recovery from the necrosis was observed in the newly developing leaves. The features of the observed resistance were analyzed and are consistent with two different mechanisms of resistance. In transgenic plants inoculated with CMV-FL strain, the symptomless phenotype was correlated to the down-regulation of CMV by Tfn-satRNA, amplified from the transgene transcripts, as the first resistance mechanism. On the other hand, the delayed resistance to CMV-77 in transgenic tomato lines was mediated by a degradation process that targets satRNAs in a sequence-specific manner. Evidence is provided for a correlation between a reduced accumulation level of transgenic messenger Tfn-satRNA, the accumulation of small (approximately 23 nucleotides) RNAs with sequence homology to satRNAs, the progressively reduced accumulation of 77-satRNA in infected tissues, and the transition in infected plants from diseased to healthy. Thus, events leading to the degradation of satRNA sequences indicate a role for RNA silencing as the second mechanism determining resistance of transgenic tomato lines."
7473231	"Thrombotic and haemorrhagic complications affect cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in haemodialysis patients. We investigated whether a new bedside Sonoclot analysis is useful for determining an appropriate heparin dose during haemodialysis.                                                                              Twenty-two haemodialysis patients (15 males and seven females) treated with unfractionated heparin were recruited. Sonoclot parameters, including activated clotting time (ACT), clot rate (CR), time to peak (TP) and peak amplitude (PA), were examined before and after haemodialysis, coupled with conventional coagulable variables, platelet count and fibrinogen level. Some indices were determined and verified to control heparin dose. Thrombotic and haemorrhagic complications were observed for 3 months. Sonoclot analysis was subsequently performed before initiation, 1 h later, 2.5 or 3 h later (before cessation of heparin infusion), and at the end of haemodialysis.                                                                              Both CR and PA were positively correlated with platelet count and fibrinogen level. Sonoclot parameters except for PA were significantly correlated with heparin dose. Heparin dose was reduced without causing complications in 12 patients with DeltaACT >   /=40 s and/or CR after haemodialysis (CRpost) <   20 U/min. Thrombotic complications occurred in five patients who had CRpost >   30 U/min. ACT and TP increased during heparin treatment. ACT was reversed but TP did not change after cessation of heparin. CR significantly decreased after initiation of heparin and was reversed, although not completely, after cessation of heparin. PA showed no significant changes during haemodialysis.                                                                                      Sonoclot analysis can monitor accurate coagulable states and determine an appropriate heparin dose during haemodialysis."
8889875	"Lentigo maligna (LM) is the in situ phase of LM melanoma (LMM). There is a paucity of data on the natural history of LM, the risk factors for progression to LMM and on treatment outcomes of the various modalities used.                                                                                   To investigate our impression that this, combined with the difficulties of treatment for large lesions particularly in the elderly and infirm, has led to considerable variation between dermatologists in the management of LM within the U.K.                                                                              A postal questionnaire survey was performed to establish current practice.                                                                              One hundred and seventy clinicians representing one-third of U.K. consultant dermatologists responded. Fifty-seven per cent of the dermatologists reported treating only one to four LMs per year, 30% treated five to 10 LMs per year and only 13% treated more than 10 LMs per year. Ninety-four per cent of the respondents routinely took an initial biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and plan treatment. The preferred treatment option was dependent on the age of the patient. Dermatologists were far more likely to use surgery for patients under the age of 60 years and more likely to use cryotherapy/radiotherapy or merely to observe with increasing age. Where surgery was used, the excision margins chosen ranged from 0 to 10 mm.                                                                                      This survey highlights that a significant proportion of U.K. dermatologists is managing small numbers of LMs each year. On the basis of this current practice and the data in the literature on the recurrence rates for the different modalities, we propose an algorithm for treatment options. The survey, however, showed no consensus between dermatologists regarding surgical margins for excision, which is reflected in the literature; further studies to establish this are required."
7249256	"The standard mixed lymphocyte culture assay, which measures the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA, usually requires 5 days. We describe a more rapid assay based on changes in the activity of ornithine decarboxylase. An increase in the activity of ornithine decarboxylase was observed in mixed lymphocyte cultures from genetically defined, major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-nonidentical miniature swine as early as 18 hr after plating. No increase was found in mixed cultures from inbred MHC-identical animals. Similar results were obtained with the enzyme S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase with the increase in activity starting at about 32 hr. There was a good correlation between the ornithine decarboxylase values at 18 hr and the results of the [3H]thymidine incorporation assay on day 5. Preliminary experiments with human lymphocytes revealed similar results."
1091438	"When oxygenic photosynthetic organisms are exposed to excessive light and/or heat, Photosystem II is damaged and electron transport is blocked. In these events, reactive oxygen species, endogenous radicals and lipid peroxidation products generated by photochemical reaction and/or heat cause the damage. Regarding light stress, plants first dissipate excessive light energy captured by light-harvesting chlorophyll protein complexes as heat to avoid the hazards, but once light stress is unavoidable, they tolerate the stress by concentrating damage in a particular protein in photosystem II, i.e., the reaction-center binding D1 protein of Photosystem II. The damaged D1 is removed by specific proteases and replaced with a new copy produced through de novo synthesis (reversible photoinhibition). When light intensity becomes extremely high, irreversible aggregation of D1 occurs and thereby D1 turnover is prevented. Once the aggregated products accumulate in Photosystem II complexes, removal of them by proteases is difficult, and irreversible inhibition of Photosystem II takes place (irreversible photoinhibition). Important is that various aspects of both the reversible and irreversible photoinhibition are highly dependent on the membrane fluidity of the thylakoids. Heat stress-induced inactivation of photosystem II is an irreversible process, which may be also affected by the fluidity of the thylakoid membranes. Here I describe why the membrane fluidity is a key to regulate the avoidance and tolerance of Photosystem II on environmental stresses."
6326306	"Human amniotic epithelial cells (h-AECs) have been shown to differentiate into cardiomyocyte-like cells in vivo that can regenerate myocardial tissue and improve cardiac function in a rat model of myocardial infarction (MI). In this study, we investigated the paracrine factors released from h-AECs under hypoxic conditions to elucidate the possible mechanisms underlying this previously reported phenomenon of h-AEC-mediated cardiac repair. We used hypoxic cell culture conditions to simulate myocardial infarction in vitro. In comparison to normal conditions, we found that h-AECs secreted higher levels of several cytokines, including angiogenin (ANG), epidermal growth factor (EGF), interleukin (IL)-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1. To determine whether transplanted h-AECs express these proangiogenic cytokines in vivo, we ligated the coronary artery of rats to cause MI and injected either h-AECs or saline into the infarcted area. We found that the infarct and border zones of rat myocardium treated with h-AECs had higher expression levels of the human-origin cytokines ANG, EGF, IL-6, and MCP-1 compared to the tissues of saline-treated rats. In conclusion, h-AECs secreted proangiogenic cytokines in a rat model of MI, which may suggest that the paracrine effect by h-AECs could regenerate myocardial tissue and improve cardiac function."

Up to now, there are reports of morphea patients initially diagnosed and treated as port wine stain. Coexistence of both diseases is not found yet. We herein present a case of juvenile localized scleroderma on the left side of trunk, with congenital port wine stain located on the ipsilateral face at V1-V2 distribution."
2472232	"Down syndrome is the most common chromosomal abnormality affecting numerous organs, including the skin. Our aim was to study mucocutaneous findings in this syndrome. To do so, 100 children with Down syndrome attending Schools for Children with Special Educational Needs and centers affiliated to the Welfare and Rehabilitation Organization in two provinces of Iran were thoroughly examined for skin and mucosal lesions. Their mean age was 11.2 years (3-20 years). Mucocutaneous findings were noted in 61. These were as follows (in decreasing order)--fissured tongue 28%, hypertrophy of tongue papilla 22%, premature graying 14%, cheilitis 13%, xerosis 12%, alopecia areata 11%, palmoplantar hyperkeratosis 10%, syringoma 6%, keratosis pilaris 4%, geographic tongue 4%, trichotillomania 4%, vitiligo 3%, seborrheic dermatitis 3%, livedo reticularis 2%. No instances of atopic dermatitis or skin infections and infestations were noted. The lack of atopic dermatitis in our series was in concordance with its low prevalence reported in recent articles. Improved hygiene due to patient care at home may underlie the absence of infections. With the increasing survival rate of those with Down syndrome, physicians should be more aware of the skin findings seen so frequently in this genetic disorder."
9544005	"Foot diseases have a high prevalence in the general population, but their impact on quality of life has not been assessed in large-scale studies. The Achilles Project surveyed foot disease in patients visiting their primary care physician or dermatologist.                                                                              A total of 43 593 patients were asked about the impact of their condition on their quality of life: pain, discomfort in walking, limitations in daily activities, and embarrassment.                                                                              Overall, 52.5% of patients had some aspect of their quality of life affected by their foot disease. More specifically, 30.7% of patients experienced pain, 40.3% had discomfort in walking, 19.6% had their daily activities limited, and 27.3% were embarrassed. The survey indicated a larger impact of foot disease on the quality of life of women vs. men in all categories, except for daily activities. Similarly, the elderly (>    or = 65 years) were more affected by their foot disease, although they suffered no more embarrassment than other age groups. Participation in sports seemed to lower the proportion of patients who had their quality of life adversely affected. Non-fungal foot diseases, particularly ulcer and gangrene, are more likely to cause pain, discomfort in walking and limit daily activities, than fungal diseases.                                                                                      In general, non-fungal foot diseases caused pain, discomfort in walking and limitations in daily activities in more patients than fungal foot diseases, but a higher proportion of patients with fungal foot diseases were embarrassed by their condition than patients with non-fungal foot diseases. The study found that the impact of foot disease on quality of life may be greater than previously suggested. Given that effective treatments are available, routine examination of patients' feet by dermatologists and primary care physicians may help to reduce the burden of these foot conditions."
5287913	"Respiratory problems or urticaria are well known in patients sensitized to tobacco. This occurs mainly as an occupational disease in tobacco workers, but also occasionally in those who smoke tobacco or dip snuff. Similar respiratory problems and anaphylactoid reactions have been observed in patients sensitized to cannabis. This may occur in those allergic to cannabis pollen when the plants bloom, in those with agricultural exposure and rarely in the end consumer. We describe a patient with generalized itching provoked by tobacco and cannabis smoking. Skin prick tests and specific IgE towards tobacco and cannabis were positive. Because of the close correlation of smoking tobacco or cannabis and the onset of symptoms, we put forward the diagnosis of a type I allergic reaction towards tobacco and cannabis."

Nevertheless, the disease has been reported to occur in people from various other ethnic and regional backgrounds.                                                                                  We report, for the first time, the occurrence of classic KS in five Inuit people living in northern Quebec, Canada.                                                                                          We describe the case of a 69-year-old Inuit man with classic KS, and report four other cases of KS in the Inuit population, identified by a review of our hospital's dermatopathology records.                                                                                     The discovery of classic KS in the Inuit population of northern Quebec brings with it new questions as to the origins of the KS-associated herpes virus in this population. It is our belief that the answers to these questions are in the genotype of the virus that is present in this community."
1599306	An incident of positional vertigo associated with osteotome technique for installation of multiple maxillary dental implants is reported. The symptoms resolved after 2 weeks with restricted physical activity and prohibition of lifting. There is a discussion of labyrinthine concussion and treatments. Suggestions for prevention are to use small sizes of osteotomes first and then progress to larger sizes and to avoid neck extension head position during osteotome use.
1140945	"Radiotherapy is an effective treatment for brain tumors but often results in cognitive deficits in survivors. Transplantation of embryonic or brain-derived neural stem/progenitor cells (BNSPCs) ameliorated cognitive impairment after irradiation (IR) in animal models. However, such an approach in patients requires a clinically relevant source of cells. We show for the first time the utilization of enteric neural stem/progenitor cells (ENSPCs) from the postnatal intestinal wall as a source of autologous cells for brain repair after injury caused by IR. Cells were isolated from the intestinal wall and propagated in vitro for 1 week. Differentiation assays showed that ENSPCs are multipotent and generated neurons, astrocytes, and myofibroblasts. To investigate whether ENSPCs can be used in vivo, postnatal day 9 mice were subjected to a single moderate irradiation dose (6 or 8 Gy). Twelve days later, mice received an intrahippocampal injection of syngeneic ENSPCs. Four weeks after transplantation, 0.5% and 1% of grafted ENSPCs were detected in the dentate gyrus of sham and irradiated animals, respectively, and only 0.1% was detected after 16 weeks. Grafted ENSPCs remained undifferentiated but failed to restore IR-induced loss of BNSPCs and the subsequent impaired growth of the dentate gyrus. We observed microglia activation, astrogliosis, and loss of granule neurons associated with grafted ENSPC clusters. Transplantation of ENSPCs did not ameliorate IR-induced impaired learning and memory. In summary, while autologous ENSPC grafting to the brain worked technically, even in the absence of immunosuppression, the protocols need to be modified to improve survival and integration."
6658521	"Quality-switched (QS) lasers are well-known effective treatment for removing solar lentigines. However, the high incidence of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) raises concern in darker skin types. This is the first study comparing efficacies and incidences of PIH in Asian skin with different degrees of irradiation between two QS lasers.                                                                             In total, 355 solar lentigines in 193 cases, skin types III-V, were randomly divided into four groups. All cases received single laser treatment. Clinical results were evaluated after 4 weeks. Groups 1 and 3 were treated 'aggressively' with endpoints of very obvious immediate whitening (IW) of the lesion. Groups 2 and 4 were treated 'mildly' with endpoints of slight IW of the lesion. Groups 1 and 2 were irradiated with the QS ruby, and groups 3 and 4 with the QS frequency doubled Nd:YAG laser.                                                                              There were no statistically significant differences in degrees of clearance among the four groups. However, PIH incidences were very different: 33.33%, 7.47%, 23.18% and 8.47% in groups 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively. The difference between aggressively and mildly irradiated groups (1 and 3 vs. 2 and 4) was statistically significant (P <    0.001). However, there was no statistical difference between the two aggressively or the two mildly irradiated groups. There were no significant differences between skin types.                                                                                     Aggressive irradiation using QS lasers resulted in a high PIH incidence, while having no advantage in efficacy. For darker skin types, mild irradiation reduces the PIH risk with no disadvantage in efficacy."
2206861	"Sensory modalities are essential for navigating through an ever-changing environment. From insects to mammals, transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are known mediators for cellular sensing. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a motile single-celled freshwater green alga that is guided by photosensory, mechanosensory, and chemosensory cues. In this type of alga, sensory input is first detected by membrane receptors located in the cell body and then transduced to the beating cilia by membrane depolarization. Although TRP channels seem to be absent in plants, C. reinhardtii possesses genomic sequences encoding TRP proteins. Here, we describe the cloning and characterization of a C. reinhardtii version of a TRP channel sharing key features present in mammalian TRP channels associated with sensory transduction. In silico sequence-structure analysis unveiled the modular design of TRP channels, and electrophysiological experiments conducted on Human Embryonic Kidney-293T cells expressing the Cr-TRP1 clone showed that many of the core functional features of metazoan TRP channels are present in Cr-TRP1, suggesting that basic TRP channel gating characteristics evolved early in the history of eukaryotes."
7708309	"Renal transplant recipients have a high risk of developing multiple and invasive urothelial tumors because of long-term immunosuppression and infections with oncogenic viruses in China. However, treatment of renal transplant recipients who developed invasive bladder tumor is challenging. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of orthotopic ileal neobladder reconstruction following radical cystectomy in renal transplant recipients. Orthotopic ileal neobladder reconstruction and preservation of the transplanted kidney were performed in two patients after one and 36 months of transplantation, respectively. One recipient was lacking a bladder because of prior cystectomy before the transplantation, and the other developed multiple and invasive bladder cancer after the transplantation. During the 14-month and seven-yr follow-up postoperation, no serious complications occurred except slight hydronephrosis in one patient. No rejection and graft dysfunction occurred in both patients with reduced dosage of immunosuppressants, and serum creatinine as a marker of renal function remained stable. Urinary continence was satisfactory during the day and night with voluntary voiding. Our experience showed that radical cystectomy and orthotopic ileal neobladder reconstruction in transplant patients with stable renal function is a safe and effective way to provide better quality of life, satisfactory urinary diversion and preservation of renal function simultaneously."
3455154	"The evaluation of graft function at various stages after transplantation is relevant, particularly at the moment of organ harvest, when a decision must be made whether to use the organ. Autofluorescence spectroscopy is noninvasive technique to monitor the metabolic condition of a liver graft throughout its course, from an initial evaluation in the donor, through cold ischemia transportation, to reperfusion and reoxygenation in the recipient. Preliminary results are presented in six liver transplantations spanning the periods from liver harvest to implant. The laser-induced fluorescence spectrum at 532-nm excitation was investigated before cold perfusion (autofluorescence), during cold ischemia, at the back table procedure, as well as 5 and 60 minutes after reperfusion. The results showed that the fluorescence analysis was sensitive to changes during the transplantation procedure. Fluorescence spectroscopy potentially provides a real-time, noninvasive technique to monitor liver graft function. The information could potentially be valuable for surgical decisions and transplant success."
4018432	"Cisplatin is one of the most effective chemotherapeutic agents used in the treatment of various kinds of malignant tumors. A major drawback associated with cisplatin chemotherapy is its cytotoxicity/genotoxicity towards normal tissues. The cytotoxicity has been attributed, in part, to the oxidative stress generated by the drug. Riboflavin is a micronutrient known for its photosensitization characteristics. Owing to the emergence of photodynamic therapy as a modality for the treatment of solid tumors and other accessible lesions in terms of opthalmic, dermatological, cardiovascular and urological diseases, the therapeutic window of riboflavin as a sensitizer has been used to avoid the toxic side effects of cisplatin.                                                       &                                    Using mice epidermal keratinocytes and comet assay, we show that photochemically activated riboflavin is able to prevent oxidative cellular DNA breakage induced by cisplatin. Irradiation of cells exposed to cisplatin resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the frequency of strand breaks in cellular DNA. Sequential incubation of keratinocytes with riboflavin and cisplatin followed by irradiation led to a significant decrease in strand breakage and reduced the generation of reactive oxygen species.                                                                                     Our results suggest that cisplatin-induced genotoxicity may be blunted or reduced by using riboflavin as a photosensitizer."
7216054	"Early detection and subsequent management of melanoma are critical for patient survival. New technologies have been developed to augment clinician analysis of suspicious pigmented skin lesions.                                                                                  To determine how information provided by a multispectral digital skin lesion analysis device affects the biopsy decisions of international dermatologists following clinical and dermoscopic pigmented skin lesion evaluation.                                                                              Participants at a dermoscopy conference in Vienna, Austria, were shown 12 clinical and dermoscopic images of pigmented skin lesions (2 melanomas in situ, 3 invasive melanomas, and 7 low-grade dysplastic nevi) previously analyzed by multispectral digital skin lesion analysis. Participants were asked if they would biopsy the lesion based on clinical images, again after observing high-resolution dermoscopy images, and again when subsequently shown multispectral digital skin lesion analysis information.                                                                              Data were analyzed from a total of 70 international dermatologists. Overall, sensitivity was 58 percent after clinical evaluation (C) and 59 percent post-dermoscopy (D), but 74 percent after multispectral digital skin lesion analysis. Participant specificity was 56 percent (C) decreasing to 51 percent (D), but increasing to 61 percent with multispectral digital skin lesion analysis. Diagnostic accuracy was 57 percent (C) decreasing to 54 percent (D), but increasing to 67 percent for dermatologists after integrating the multispectral digital skin lesion analysis data into the biopsy decision. The overall number of lesions biopsied increased from 50 percent (C) to 53 percent (D), rising to 54 percent after multispectral digital skin lesion analysis.                                                                                     Decisions to biopsy melanocytic lesions were more sensitive and specific when multispectral digital skin lesion analysis information was provided with no significant increase in the number of biopsies recommended. Providing multispectral digital skin lesion analysis data may lead to additional improvement in biopsy accuracy with a concomitant decrease in the number of nonessential biopsies for pigmented skin lesions even after dermoscopic evaluation."
7190267	"Proteinuria is a candidate surrogate end point for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in chronic kidney disease (CKD). There is a reasonably sound biological basis for this hypothesis, but only preliminary empirical evidence currently exists.                                                                              A systematic review and creation of a patient-level dataset of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in CKD that reported changes in proteinuria and assessed progression of kidney disease as defined by dialysis, transplantation, death, or changes in GFR or creatinine were performed.                                                                              Systematic review. Seventy RCTs met the eligibility criteria; 17 eligible RCTs contained analyses of proteinuria as a predictor of outcomes; 15 RCTs concluded that greater proteinuria was associated with adverse outcomes. A majority were studies of diabetic or hypertensive kidney disease and tested renin-angiotensin system blockade. Definitions of predictor and outcome variables were too variable to conduct a meta-analysis of group data. Database creation. Over 4 years was required to create the patient-level dataset. The final dataset included 34 studies and >    9000 patients with a variety of CKD types and interventions.                                                                                      There are a relatively small number of RCTs designed to rigorously test therapies for kidney disease progression. Current analyses of change in proteinuria as a predictor of CKD progression are heterogeneous and incomplete, indicating further evaluation in a pooled individual patient-level database is necessary to advance knowledge in this field."
7021022	"Systemic and focal infections by microorganisms have been known to induce or exacerbate psoriasis. To investigate the role of Malassezia species in the development of psoriasis, we analyzed the Malassezia microflora in psoriasis patients using a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, and compared it with those in atopic dermatitis (AD) patients and healthy subjects. Fungal DNA was directly collected from the lesional and non-lesional skin of the trunk of 22 psoriasis patients by applying a transparent dressing. The extracted DNA was amplified by using specific primers designed for the PCR in the intergenic spacer or internal transcribed spacer area of the ribosomal RNA. All nine of the Malassezia species were detected at different rates from the 22 psoriasis patients. The overall detection rates in lesional and non-lesional skin of M. restricta, M. globosa and M. sympodialis were high (96%, 82% and 64%, respectively), whereas the detection rates of the other species were relatively low. However, there was no difference in the rates between lesional and non-lesional skin areas. The average number of Malassezia species detected in overall sites of the psoriasis patients was 3.7 +/- 1.6 species, although this fact showed no correlation with the severity of the symptoms. The number of Malassezia species detected was 4.1 +/- 1.9 in the AD patients, and 2.8 +/- 0.8 in the healthy subjects, suggesting that the skin microflora of psoriasis patients and AD patients show greater diversity than that of healthy subjects."
7818787	"Der Zusammenhang zwischen Lungenkrebs und Ekzemen bleibt umstritten. Frühere Studien haben zu widersprüchlichen Ergebnissen geführt. Diese retrospektive populationsbasierte Kohortenstudie zielt darauf ab, das Risiko von Lungenkrebs im Zusammenhang mit Ekzemen abzuklären.                                                                                                In der Forschungsdatenbank der taiwanesischen nationalen Krankenversicherung identifizierten wir 43719 Patienten, bei denen in den Jahren 2000 bis 2010 ein Ekzem neu diagnostiziert wurde. Die Vergleichskohorte bildeten 87438 zufällig ausgewählte, altersangepasste Patienten ohne Ekzem. Die Fälle aus diesen beiden Kohorten wurden bis 2011 verfolgt. Zur Kalkulation des Lungenkrebsrisikos bei Ekzempatienten wurde die Cox-Regression verwendet. Die Datenbank enthielt keine Informationen über Raucherstatus, Alkoholkonsum, sozioökonomischen Status oder Familienanamnese.                                                                                    Nach der Bereinigung um Alter und Komorbidität hatte die Population mit Ekzemen ein um 2,80 erhöhtes Risiko für die Entwicklung von Lungenkrebs gegenüber der Vergleichskohorte (bereinigte Hazard-Ratio 2,80, 95 % Konfidenzinterval 2,59-3,03). Ekzempatienten mit Begleiterkrankungen, darunter Asthma, chronisch obstruktive Lungenerkrankungen, alkoholbedingten Leberschäden oder Diabetes, hatten ein höheres Lungenkrebsrisiko als Patienten ohne Ekzeme oder Komorbidität.                                                                                            Ekzeme gehen mit einem höheren Risiko für die Entwicklung von Lungenkrebs einher. Weitere Studien mit umfassenderen Informationen über weitere potentielle Einflussfaktoren sind sinnvoll."
6203118	"Potassium para-aminobenzoate was tested for its ability to affect growth and macromolecule synthesis in vitro using fibroblasts from normal human skin, from affected skin of patients with scleroderma, and rheumatoid synovial cells. The proliferation of all 3 cell types showed dose-dependent inhibition beginning at about 3000 microgram/ml. Acid mucopolysaccharide secretion by rheumatoid synovial cells and scleroderma fibroblasts was inhibited even at 100 microgram/ml, which is within the therapeutic range, and there was over 50% inhibition at 5000 microgram/ml. Collagen synthesis by several different strains, was not affected, despite the use of a range of concentrations and treatment times."
4766408	"Insulin resistance is considered to play an important role in the development of cardiovascular disease, which limits long-term renal transplant survival. Renal transplant recipients are more insulin-resistant compared with healthy controls. It is not known to date which factors relate to this excess insulin resistance. Therefore, we investigated which factors are related to insulin resistance long-term after renal transplantation.                                                                              All renal transplant recipients at our outpatient clinic with a functioning graft for more than one year were invited to participate. We excluded diabetic recipients. Recipient, donor, and transplant characteristics were collected as putative determinants. We used fasting insulin, homeostasis model assessment index, and McAuley's index as valid estimates of insulin resistance. Linear regression models were created to investigate independent determinants of all indexes.                                                                              A total of 483 recipients (57% male, 50+/-12 years) were analyzed at a median (interquartile range) time of 6.0 (2.6-11.6) years posttransplant. The most consistent determinants across all three indices were body mass index (P<   0.001), waist-to-hip ratio (P<   0.001), and prednisolone dose (P<   0.05). Independent associations were present for total cholesterol (P<   0.001), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P<   0.001), creatinine clearance (P<   0.05), recipient age (P<   0.001), and gender (P<    or =0.002). No independent associations were present for transplant-related factors such as acute rejection treatment or cytomegalovirus seropositivity.                                                                                      Our results indicate that obesity, distribution of obesity, and prednisolone treatment are the predominant determinants of insulin resistance long term after transplantation. Insulin resistance after renal transplantation could be managed favorably by weight and prednisolone dose reduction, which may reduce cardiovascular disease."
5588674	"Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections are usually chronically recurrent in the normal population and represent a significant cause of morbidity in immunocompromised patients. Acyclovir (ACV) is widely used for the treatment and prophylaxis of HSV infections. The emergence of ACV-resistant strains has been frequently reported as a result of long-term ACV therapy.                                                                            Despite the widespread use of ACV, there are no data available in our area on the frequency of ACV-resistant HSVs. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the susceptibility of HSV isolated from normal subjects and patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) to ACV.                                                                              HSVs were isolated from the orofacial region of normal individuals and patients with AIDS. The susceptibility of isolated HSV strains to various concentrations of ACV was determined by plaque reduction assay. The sensitivity of the viral strains was expressed as IC(50) (the concentration of drug reducing the viral plaque by 50%).                                                                              One hundred and thirty-three isolates from 102 normal subjects and 31 patients with AIDS were tested. One HSV-1 isolate from normal individuals had intermediate susceptibility. Two ACV-resistant isolates (one HSV-1 and one HSV-2), with IC(50) >    or = 2 to <    or = 3 microg/mL, and one highly resistant HSV-2 isolate, with IC(50) >    or = 5 microg/mL, were detected in patients with AIDS.                                                                                      Our data show that the prevalence of ACV-resistant strains is very low in the general immunocompetent population; however, in patients with AIDS, the prevalence of ACV-resistant strains is remarkable (P = 0.001). Alternative antiherpetic agents should be employed to control and reduce the emergence of ACV-resistant strains in patients with AIDS."
6857865	Two patients with lichen sclerosus (et atrophicus) are described in whom there was conspicuous localization of lesions to sites subjected to friction from tight clothing. This was highly suggestive of the Köbner phenomenon. Both patients experienced symptomatic improvement following avoidance of pressure on the skin from tight clothing.
6229731	"The Osnabrück Hand Eczema Severity Index (OHSI) is a scoring system for the assessment of the severity of hand eczema (HE).                                                                                  To assess the clinimetric value of the OHSI and to validate the longitudinal responsiveness of the OHSI using the Manuscore as a gold standard.                                                                              OHSI and Manuscore scores were compared before and after 3 weeks' inpatient treatment of 62 patients with occupational HE. Correlation coefficients and 95% limits of agreement were calculated and the ability of OHSI to identify severe HE was analysed. The responsiveness of the OHSI in monitoring skin changes over time was evaluated by calculating effect sizes.                                                                              High correlation was found between the OHSI and Manuscore at both scoring occasions (around r(s) = 0.77). Differences between both measurements were within the 95% limits of agreement for 94% of patients, with a tendency for the OHSI to underestimate the severity at very low and at very high values compared with the Manuscore. Responsiveness to change was good. Both instruments showed significant improvement between the scoring occasions. Using the OHSI values, the proportion of classification to the correct tertile of score change was 69%. Effect size from untreated to treated was 0.6 for the Manuscore and 1.1 for the OHSI, with higher effect sizes in individuals with severe HE.                                                                                      Even though the OHSI allows less differentiation than the Manuscore, it shows adequate validity and responsiveness to change. Thus the OHSI is suitable for both monitoring the severity of HE and the effects of treatment."
1433377	"Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a multifunctional cytokine, which, among various other activities, acts as a growth factor for melanocytes and has recently been implicated in the pathogenesis of malignant melanoma. In the skin, the main source for HGF is dermal fibroblasts (FB). Here, we have investigated the regulation of HGF production and secretion by cytokines derived from UV-irradiated keratinocytes (KC) and by direct UV irradiation. We demonstrate that supernatants of ultraviolet (UV)B-irradiated KC strongly induce HGF production in FB, and that this effect was mediated primarily by IL-1alpha. Direct irradiation of FB with UVB had no effect on HGF expression. In contrast, irradiation with UVA1 strongly upregulated HGF mRNA production and secretion of the functional protein. Addition of neutralizing anti-HGF antibodies after UVA1 irradiation, as well as transfection of FB with HGF small-interfering RNA (siRNA); which completely abrogated HGF secretion led to a dramatic rise of FB apoptosis demonstrating that autocrine HGF efficiently protected FB from UVA1-induced apoptosis. Our data suggest that upregulation of HGF plays a role in skin homeostasis after UV irradiation. However, a negative side effect of UV-induced HGF secretion by dermal FB might represent a decisive factor for induction and/or progression of melanoma."
8957547	"Tumor promoting phorbol esters, such as 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), when applied topically to mouse skin cause inflammation and hyperplasia. The major cellular phorbol ester receptor is a calcium and phospholipid dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C (PK-C). PK-C is directly activated by TPA and most of the responses of cells to TPA appear to be mediated by PK-C. This suggests that PK-C may play a key role as a mediator of inflammation and growth in TPA treated mouse skin. Sphingosine has been reported to be a potent inhibitor of PK-C in vitro and in intact leukocytes. We therefore have investigated the effects of sphingosine upon TPA-induced inflammation, hyperplasia, induction of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity and ODC mRNA, and activation of PK-C in mouse skin. The results demonstrate that sphingosine is a potent inhibitor of all of the TPA-induced responses examined. These data are compatible with the hypothesis that PK-C is a major mediator of the phorbol ester response in mouse skin. Furthermore, PK-C inhibitors may have therapeutic potential in inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis."
4426684	"1. Spinach was harvested once a week, beginning five weeks after sowing. The leaves were divided into three categories, according to their height of insertion. For every category, Hill-activity and manganese content (by atomic absorption) were measured. The remaining leaf material was homogenised in distilled water or in a mixture of 0.6 M sucrose and 0.05 M Tris/maleate buffer, pH 7.8, and the homogenate was separated by differential centrifugation into two fractions: a green precipitate consisting mainly of chloroplast fragments and a yellow supernatant. Chloroplast fragments, isolated in sucrose medium, were washed with distilled water. Manganese and nitrogen content of the precipitate and the supernatant were determined, as was the chlorophyll concentration of the precipitate. 2. The manganese content in the old leaves and their fractions increased; nitrogen concentration, chlorophyll concentration, chlorophyll/nitrogen and chlorophyll/manganese ratios decreased. 3. The lowest inserted leaves and their fractions had a different chemical composition from the rest: they had a higher manganese and a lower nitrogen content. The chlorophyll/nitrogen ratio of the lamellae was also higher. 4. At the beginning, the lowest inserted leaves had the same manganese content as the seeds. Then the manganese concentration decreased slightly and increased again when leaf decomposition began. 5. We found a chlorophyll/manganese ratio of 104 molecules chlorophyll to 1 atom manganese. 6. Hill activity decreased with increasing age of the shoot. It seemed to be a function of the shoot age rather than the leaf age. 7. The manner of preparation had an effect on the chlorophyll/dry weight ratio, but not on the manganese/dry weight and nitrogen/dry weight ratios. Therefore the manganese/chlorophyll and the chlorophyll/nitrogen ratios depended on the manner of preparation."
3011184	"Although diffuse linear C4d deposition in peritubular capillaries (PTCs) is a well-established criterion of alloantibody-mediated kidney transplant rejection, the actual relevance of focal or granular C4d deposits or staining outside PTC (glomeruli and arterioles) has yet to be established.                                                                              This study was designed to evaluate the diagnostic significance of such nontypical C4d staining patterns. A total of 539 early indication biopsies (329 kidney transplants) were analyzed by immunohistochemistry using a polyclonal anti-C4d antibody.                                                                              We found a close interrelationship between diffuse or focal linear C4d deposition in PTC, linear endothelial deposition in glomeruli, and arteriolar C4d. These specific patterns were also related to transplant glomerulitis and recipient presensitization. No such associations, however, were observed for other patterns, such as granular C4d in PTC. Detection of diffuse but not focal linear C4d in PTC was found to be associated with adverse allograft survival (5-year death-censored graft survival: 48% vs. 82%, 89%, or 84% in patients with focal, minimal, or no C4d, respectively; P<   0.0001). Univariate analysis also revealed inferior graft survival in recipients with linear C4d in glomeruli (P=0.02). Applying multivariate Cox regression analysis, however, only diffuse linear PTC staining was found to be predictive of graft loss (hazard ratio 3.95 [95% confidence interval 1.62-9.60]; P=0.002).                                                                                     There might be a relationship between humoral alloimmunity and distinct less established staining patterns, such as focal linear C4d in PTC, endothelial C4d in glomeruli, or arteriolar C4d. Nevertheless, our results reemphasize the prognostic value of diffuse linear PTC staining."

5207770	"Baseline staging in patients with primary cutaneous malignant melanoma (MM) is routine, but the diagnostic accuracy and the impact on clinical outcome are still unclear.                                                                                   To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of baseline staging in the early detection of regional lymph node metastases or distant metastases in patients with MM.                                                                              One hundred consecutive patients with MM of Breslow's tumour thickness over 1.0 mm were enrolled. All patients had an extensive baseline staging including physical examination, ultrasound (US) of the abdomen and regional lymph nodes, chest X-ray, whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) and sentinel lymph node biopsy. The sensitivity and specificity of detection of macroscopic or microscopic metastases in the regional lymph nodes or at distant sites were calculated for each method.                                                                              Sentinel lymph node biopsy was positive in 26 patients. US detected two of 26 histologically tumour-positive sentinel nodes (sensitivity 8%, specificity 88%) and PET two of 26 (sensitivity 8%; specificity 100%). There were three lymph node metastases with a diameter >    4 mm. All of them were found suspect at physical examination. Two of them were detectable with US, two with PET, and all were identified with either US or PET. Nine patients had suspect findings at distant sites, which were all false positive on further investigation (specificity of the combined staging procedures 91%). At 18 (6-37) months' follow-up, five of 26 (19%) patients with a positive sentinel node and four of 74 (5%) of patients with a negative sentinel node had recurrent or progressive disease.                                                                                      The combination of physical examination and lymph node US detects the great majority of patients with macroscopic lymph node metastasis (approximately 3% of patients at baseline). Only 10% of patients who have a histologically tumour-positive sentinel node are macroscopically detectable. Altogether, approximately 25% of patients have a positive sentinel node biopsy, among 90% microscopic. The value of whole body staging at baseline remains limited, since distant metastases can hardly ever be detected. The survival benefit of baseline staging and surveillance in patients with cutaneous MM remains to be established by comparative prospective trials."
1027590	"Fractional photothermolysis has become popular in the recent years and is currently widely used for the treatment of scars and for photo-rejuvenation purposes. The fractional photothermolysis is to thermally alter a 'fraction' of the skin, leaving intervening areas of normal skin untouched, which rapidly repopulate the altered columns of tissue. Fractional photothermolysis is subdivided into non-ablative and ablative fractional resurfacing. Ablative fractional resurfacing uses fractional CO(2) or Er:YAG lasers to create deeper columns of thermal damage.Few studies have compared fractional CO(2) and Er:YAG lasers on scars and cutaneous photodamages by a split trial. In this pilot study, we have compared the effects, down time, postprocedure erythema, pain of CO(2) and Er:YAG fractional lasers using analysis of clinical photographs, dermoscopic findings and patient's rate of satisfaction."
3335140	"In vivo visualization of epidermal melanin was performed by reflectance-mode confocal microscopy (RCM). Firstly, we examined the distribution of epidermal melanin in pigmented animals and compared with that of the human skin. Melanocytes in the skin of pigmented animals were found to accumulate a large amount of melanin that can be easily visualized because of its brightness. Their RCM images correlated well with the Fontana-Masson-stained sections for melanin. In contrast, in the human skin, typical dendritic melanocytes were hardly observed even in pigmented lesions, although supranuclear melanin caps were easily visible. These results suggested that human melanocytes rapidly transfer the produced melanin to keratinocytes and do not accumulate it. Secondly, to elucidate the production of melanin by human melanocytes, we evaluated the changes of melanin after a single ultraviolet (UV) exposure. The melanin-accumulating melanocytes were clearly visualized during the skin pigmentation process. The RCM images showed the brightness because of melanin gradually increased from day 4, then dendrite-elongated melanocytes appearing from day 8, and finally melanin caps formed from day 29. In conclusion, RCM successfully evidenced the difference in melanin distribution between the pigmented animals and humans, and the UV-induced pigmentation process in vivo as well."
8408960	"Plant cytokinesis occurs by the growth of cell plates from the interior to the periphery of the cell. These dynamic events in cytokinesis are mediated by a plant-specific microtubule (MT) array called the phragmoplast, which consists of bundled antiparallel MTs between the two daughter nuclei. The NACK-PQR pathway, a NACK1 kinesin-like protein and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, is a key regulator of plant cytokinesis through the regulation of phragmoplast MTs. The MT-associated protein MAP65 has been identified as one of the structural components of MT assays involved in cell division, and we recently showed that Arabidopsis AtMAP65-3/PLEIADE (PLE) is a substrate of MPK4 that is a component of the NACK-PQR pathway in Arabidopsis. Here we show that AtMAP65-1 and AtMAP65-2 are also phosphorylated by MPK4. AtMAP65-1 and AtMAP65-2 that localize to the phragmoplast were phosphorylated by MPK4 in vitro. Although mutants of the Arabidopsis AtMAP65-1 and AtMAP65-2 genes exhibited a wild-type phenotype, double mutations of AtMAP65-3 and AtMAP65-1 or AtMAP65-2 caused more severe growth and cytokinetic defects than the single atmap65-3/ple mutation. These results suggest that AtMAP65-1 and AtMAP65-2 also function in cytokinesis downstream of MPK4."

This research reviewed the experience with cardiac transplantation in Chagas' disease, emphasizing reactivation, immunosuppression, and mortality.                                                                              Over 25 years from March 1985 to March 2010, 107/409 (26.2%) patients with Chagas' disease underwent heart transplantation, patients including 74 (71.1%) men and 72 (67.2%), in functional class IV with 33 (30.8%) on vasopressors and 17 (10.7%) on mechanical circulatory support.                                                                              The diagnosis of disease reactivation was performed by identifying the parasite in the myocardium (n = 23; 71.8%) in the subcutaneous tissue (n = 8; 25.0%), in blood (n = 11; 34.3%), or in central nervous tissue (n = 1; 3.1%). Hospital mortality was 17.7% (n = 19) due to infection (n = 6; 31.5%), graft dysfunction (n = 6; 31.5%), rejection (n = 4; 21.1%), or sudden death (n = 2; 10.5%). Late mortality was 27 (25.2%) cases, which were distributed as: rejection (n = 6; 22.2%), infection (n = 6; 22.2%), (n = lymphoma 4; 14.8%), sarcoma (n = 2; 7.4%), for constrictive pericarditis (n = 2; 7.4%) reactivation of Chagas' disease in the central nervous system (n = 1; 7.1%).                                                                                      Transplantation in Chagas' disease has peculiar problems that differ from other etiologies due to the possibility of disease reactivation and the increased possibility of emergence of cancers. However, transplantation is the only treatment able to modify the natural progression of the disease in its terminal phase. Early diagnosis and rapid introduction of benzonidazole reverses the histological patterns. Immunosuppression, especially steroids, predisposes to the development of cancer and disease reactivation."
1802215	"The control of flowering is not only important for reproduction, but also plays a key role in the processes of domestication and adaptation. To reveal the genetic architecture for flowering time and photoperiod sensitivity, a comprehensive evaluation of the relevant literature was performed and followed by meta analysis. A total of 25 synthetic consensus quantitative trait loci (QTL) and four hot-spot genomic regions were identified for photoperiod sensitivity including 11 genes related to photoperiod response or flower morphogenesis and development. Besides, a comparative analysis of the QTL for flowering time and photoperiod sensitivity highlighted the regions containing shared and unique QTL for the two traits. Candidate genes associated with maize flowering were identified through integrated analysis of the homologous genes for flowering time in plants and the consensus QTL regions for photoperiod sensitivity in maize (Zea mays L.). Our results suggest that the combination of literature review, meta-analysis and homologous blast is an efficient approach to identify new candidate genes and create a global view of the genetic architecture for maize photoperiodic flowering. Sequences of candidate genes can be used to develop molecular markers for various models of marker-assisted selection, such as marker-assisted recurrent selection and genomic selection that can contribute significantly to crop environmental adaptation."
4903394	"A proper definition of the 'optimal' number of implants to support a full arch prosthesis should go beyond solely a listing of the number of implants used in a treatment plan; it should be based upon a biomechanical analysis that takes into account several factors: the locations of the implants in the jaw; the quality and quantity of bone into which they are placed; the loads (forces and moments) that develop on the implants; the magnitudes of stress and strain that develop in the interfacial bone as well as in the implants and prosthesis; and the relationship of the stresses and strains to limits for the materials involved. Overall, determining an 'optimal' number of implants to use in a patient is a biomechanical design problem. This paper discusses some of the approaches that are already available to aid biomechanically focused clinical treatment planning. A number of examples are presented to illustrate how relatively simple biomechanical analyses - e.g. the Skalak model - as well as more complex analyses (e.g. finite element modelling) can be used to assess the pros and cons of various arrangements of implants to support fullarch prostheses. Some of the examples considered include the use of 4 rather than 6 implants to span the same arc-length in a jaw, and the pros and cons of using tilted implants as in the 'all-on-4' approach. In evaluating the accuracy of the various biomechanical analyses, it is clear that our current prediction methods are not always perfectly accurate in vivo, although they can provide a reasonably approximate analysis of a treatment plan in many situations. In the current era of cone beam computerised tomography (CT) scans of patients in the dental office, there is significant promise for finite element analyses (FEA) based on anatomically-accurate input data. However, at the same time it has to be recognised that effective use of FEA software requires a reasonable engineering background, especially insofar as interpretations of the clinical significance of stresses and strains in bone and prosthetic materials."
6984515	"Lymphomatoid papulosis is a chronic disease of cutaneous lymphoid infiltration characterized clinically by involuting and recurring papules, plaques, and nodules. The intriguing combination of a usually benign clinical course, a cytologically malignant lymphoid infiltrate on histologic examination, and a clear, but sporadic association with extracutaneous lymphomas has stimulated significant investigation. Application of recent technical advances to research in lymphomatoid papulosis prompts this review."
3160578	"A 59-year-old woman presented with an itchy and uncomfortable raised lesion at a tattoo site (Fig. 1) on the lateral aspect of the left leg, just above the ankle. The tattoo had been placed 2 years before her presentation and the tattoo site was sun exposed. Immediately after she had the tattoo, she noticed redness of the skin. After a week, a pruritic and red scaly nodule developed that continued to gradually enlarge until her presentation. The patient had tried topical vitamin A and D ointment with no relief. The patient also had tattoos on the arms without any noticeable skin changes. The patient reported that the tattoo procedure on her leg was more painful than that on her arms, and was performed by a different (and perhaps inexperienced) tattoo artist. The original tattoo contained red, green, and yellow pigments. A diagnosis of tattoo granuloma was considered; squamous cell carcinoma and fungal infection were included in the differential diagnosis. A punch biopsy was performed, followed by complete surgical excision of the lesion with a split-thickness skin graft from the right thigh. The skin excision specimen showed a 3 x 2.5-cm granular and pitted pink lesion with well-demarcated, somewhat irregular borders. The lesion was raised 0.5 cm above the skin surface. The lesion was present in the center of the original tattoo. Portions of the original tattoo with green and blue-green pigmentation were visible on either side of the lesion. No satellite lesions were identified. Microscopically, the raised lesion demonstrated striking pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, with irregular acanthosis of the epidermis and follicular infundibula, hyperkeratosis, and parakeratosis (Fig. 2). Follicular plugging was present with keratin-filled cystic spaces. There was a brisk mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate in the dermis, composed primarily of lymphocytes, with admixed plasma cells and histiocytes. Giant cells were occasionally identified. Dermal pigment deposition was noted both within the lesion and in the surrounding skin, corresponding to the original tattoo. Variable dermal fibrosis was noted, with thick collagen bundles in some areas. There was no evidence of epidermal keratinocytic atypia, dyskeratosis, or increased suprabasal mitotic activity. Special stains (periodic acid-Schiff and acid-fast) for microorganisms were negative."
1320948	"A fuller understanding of the interaction between plants and engineered nanomaterials is of topical relevance because the latter are beginning to find applications in agriculture and the food industry. There is a growing need to establish objective safety criteria for their use. The recognition of two independent Arabidopsis thaliana mutants displaying a greater level of tolerance than the wild type plant to exposure to cadmium sulfide quantum dots (CdS QDs) has offered the opportunity to characterize the tolerance response at the physiological, transcriptomic, and proteomic levels. Here, a proteomics-based comparison confirmed the conclusions drawn from an earlier transcriptomic analysis that the two mutants responded to CdS QD exposure differently both to the wild type and to each other. Just over half of the proteomic changes mirrored documented changes at the level of gene transcription, but a substantial number of transcript/gene product pairs were altered in the opposite direction. An interpretation of the discrepancies is given, along with some considerations regarding the use and significance of -omics when monitoring the potential toxicity of ENMs for health and environment."
1264091	"The fresh rhizome of Zingiber zerumbet (L.) Roscoe ex Smith (Zingiberaceae) is widely used as a folk medicine in Taiwan. In this study, the fresh rhizome was extracted with 95 % EtOH and partitioned with diethyl ether. The antitumor effects of the diethyl ether extract were measured in cultured P-388D (1) cells and in an animal model of P-388D (1)-bearing CDF (1) mice. The results indicated that the extract could induce DNA fragmentation in P-388D (1) cells in vitro, and significantly prolong the life of P-388D (1)-bearing CDF (1) mice (ILS% = 127.8) at a dosage of 5 mg/kg body weight. After column chromatography combined with an MTT cytotoxicity bioassay, zerumbone, a cyclic sesquiterpene was isolated from the diethyl ether extract. Zerumbone inhibited the growth of P-388D (1) cells, induced DNA fragmentation in culture, and significantly prolonged the life of P-388D (1)-bearing CDF (1) mice (ILS% = 120.5) at a dosage of 2 mg/kg. Furthermore, zerumbone inhibited the growth of a human leukemia cell line, HL-60 cells, in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, with IC (50) values of 22.29, 9.12, and 2.27 microg/mL for 6, 12, and 18 h, respectively. The cell cycle of HL-60 cells was observed after treatment with zerumbone, which induced G (2)/M cell cycle arrest in HL-60 cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, and decreased the cyclin B1/cdk 1 protein level. These results suggest that zerumbone is an active principal of Z. zerumbet and is potentially a lead compound for the development of anticancer drugs."
2357598	"The changes in parathyroid hormone secretion after successful renal transplantation remain to be clearly elucidated. Our study was aimed at identifying the predictors of hyperparathyroidism in renal transplant recipients. A retrospective single center study involving 37 renal transplant recipients, with a follow-up of at least one year, was performed. All transplants were performed using kidneys from living related donors. The average age of the study patients was 30 +/- 10 years, with a male-female ratio of 1.31. The mean duration on hemodialysis (HD) prior to transplantation was 25 +/- 18 months. All the grafts but one, were functional after a mean follow-up of 41 +/- 21 months. We noted a rapid reduction of the mean parathyroid hormone (iPTH) level from 383 +/- 265 pg/ml before transplantation to 125 +/- 67 pg/ml at one year and 108 +/- 66 pg/ml at two years after transplantation (p = 0.01). Bivariate analysis revealed that the level of iPTH obtained during follow-up correlated with the duration on HD (p = 0.03), the serum creatinine at 24-months (p = 0.013), and to the level of iPTH in the first year post-transplantation (p = <    0.001). Other clinical or laboratory parameters were not predictive of hyperparathyroidism after kidney transplantation. Linear regression showed that only the serum creatinine at 24-months independently correlated with the level of iPTH at last follow-up (p = 0.02). Our study suggests that short duration on HD and a functional graft are the main predictors of correction of hyperparathyroidism after renal transplantation."
8475472	"An earlier study reported that a common polymorphism in the 5' untranslated region of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) gene is associated with increased risk for cutaneous malignant melanoma (MM) and Breslow thickness. Since then, several independent studies have reported conflicting results that have challenged this hypothesis. However, none of the previous studies examined survival as the primary outcome. We therefore sought to study the association between this polymorphism and survival. One hundred and thirty patients diagnosed with MM with a Breslow thickness of >   1.5 mm were included in this study. In our collective, the G/G genotype represented a significant risk factor for both shorter disease-free period (hazard ratio of 2.246, 95% CI: 1.06-4.78, P=0.036) and overall MM-specific survival (hazard ratio of 3.8, 95% CI: 1.5-9.5, P=0.004) compared with the A/A genotype, while the heterozygous A/G genotype showed an intermediate risk. In the present study, we demonstrate for the first time that the EGF A61G polymorphism is associated with survival. Our data suggest that this polymorphism is a potential marker for disease severity that predicts earlier progression of MM."
8612746	"The purpose of this retrospective study was to assess if there was a difference in the likelihood of achieving passive fit when an implant-supported full-arch prosthesis framework is fabricated with or without the aid of a verification jig.                                                                                            This investigation was approved by the University of Rochester Research Subject Review Board (protocol #RSRB00038482). Thirty edentulous patients, 49 to 73 years old (mean 61 years old), rehabilitated with a nonsegmented fixed implant-supported complete denture were included in the study. During the restorative process, final impressions were made using the pickup impression technique and elastomeric impression materials. For 16 patients, a verification jig was made (group J), while for the remaining 14 patients, a verification jig was not used (group NJ) and the framework was fabricated directly on the master cast. During the framework try-in appointment, the fit was assessed by clinical (Sheffield test) and radiographic inspection and recorded as passive or nonpassive.                                                                              When a verification jig was used (group J, n = 16), all frameworks exhibited clinically passive fit, while when a verification jig was not used (group NJ, n = 14), only two frameworks fit. This difference was statistically significant (p <    .001).                                                                                      Within the limitations of this retrospective study, the fabrication of a verification jig ensured clinically passive fit of metal frameworks in nonsegmented fixed implant-supported complete denture."
9001235	"End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients exhibit an extraordinarily high annual mortality secondary to cardiac and vascular causes, particularly sudden cardiac death (SCD). Left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy is a frequent finding and constitutes an independent predictor of mortality risk in these patients. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) are cardioprotective in heart failure patients and effectively reduce LV mass, but are considered inappropriate in patients with severe renal impairment, given their potential to cause hyperkalaemia. Recent data from small clinical studies suggest that MRAs may be safe in patients undergoing regular haemodialysis, but cardiovascular (CV) protection in these patients is unclear. We here review the literature on CV effects of MRA in dialysis patients and report the design of the Mineralocorticoid Receptor antagonists in End-stage renal Disease (MiREnDa) trial.                                                                              The MiREnDa trial is a prospective randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group, multi-centre, intervention study investigating the effects of spironolactone (50 mg daily) compared with placebo in maintenance haemodialysis patients. The change in LV mass index (LVMI) as assessed by cardiac magnet resonance imaging (CMR) constitutes the primary efficacy end point. Secondary end points include changes in LV geometry and function, office and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure, cardiac arrhythmias, vascular function parameters, measures of heart failure and quality of life. Pre-dialysis potassium levels and the incidence of threatening hyperkalaemia (pre-dialysis potassium ≥6.5 mmol/L) constitute safety end points.                                                                                      MiREnDa will investigate CV efficacy and safety of spironolactone in haemodialysis patients [clinical trials.gov NCT01691053]."
5433092	"Reports on infectious complications following reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) before allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) are equivocal. This prospective follow-up study compared the impact of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections following RIC with fludarabine, ATG and busulphan or conventional myeloablative conditioning (MAC). Forty-eight RIC and 59 MAC patients were enrolled. The occurrence and severity of CMV infections within 100 days following allo-SCT were assessed, using plasma CMV DNA load kinetics. CMV DNAemia was observed in 21 RIC (60%) and in 19 MAC (44%) patients at risk for CMV. The mean CMV DNAemia free survival time was comparable following RIC and MAC: 70 days (95% (confidence interval) CI: 59-80 days) and 77 days (95% CI: 68-86 days), respectively (P=0.24). Parameters indicative for the level of CMV reactivation, including the area under the curve of CMV DNA load over time as well as the onset, the peak values and duration of CMV infection episodes, the numbers and duration of CMV treatment episodes and recurrent infections, were not different in both groups. During follow-up, none of the patients developed CMV disease. RIC with fludarabine, ATG and busulphan demonstrated safety comparable to conventional MAC with regard to frequency and severity of CMV infections within 100 days following T cell-depleted allo-SCT."

8527370	"Type VII collagen is the predominant, if not the exclusive, component of the anchoring fibrils. In this study, we have examined the expression of the type VII collagen gene in human skin fibroblasts and keratinocytes in culture by Northern analyses and immunocytochemistry. Type VII collagen gene expression was greatly enhanced in all cell strains studied after stimulation by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). However, no definitive correlation between the donor age and the magnitude of TGF-beta response could be made. In contrast, the basal expression of the type VII collagen gene was shown to decrease in an age-dependent manner in fibroblasts. The pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were shown to elevate type VII collagen mRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner. This response was inversely related to the donor age of the cell cultures. The attenuated response of cells from older individuals to TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta was specific for type VII collagen gene expression, because, in the same experiments, collagenase gene expression was strongly elevated by the two cytokines. Our data suggest that type VII collagen gene expression is subject to modulation by the cytokine network, which may play a role in controlling anchoring fibril assembly in normal skin and in pathologic conditions characterized by altered deposition of type VII collagen."
6733732	"Administration of epidermal growth factor (EGF) extracted from mouse submaxillary gland to Merino sheep resulted in a temporary inhibition of the activity of the wool follicles. Subsequently, either complete discontinuities appeared in the fibers resulting in shedding of the entire fleece, or incomplete, in which case the fleece was retained but bore a zone of weakness. The protein composition of the first sample of wool harvested from 1 sheep following infusion for 66 hr with 27.5 mg EGF (0-2 weeks posttreatment) was similar to pretreatment wool. This represented wool fibers which were already present in the follicles at the beginning of infusion. Thereafter, the composition of the wool changed progressively, reaching a maximum divergence from the control in the 3-4 week regrowth period followed by a return to normal by about 10 weeks. Over this period the content of high-sulfur proteins first rose from an initial 19% to a maximum of 30%, then returned to 19%, while the high-tyrosine protein content initially decreased from 12% to 5% and then slowly increased to 12%. In addition to changes in overall protein composition, two-dimensional electrophoresis revealed alterations in the proportions of some individual protein components. These changes were similar to those observed with many other wool growth inhibitors. Smaller doses of EGF (5.8 and 2.9 mg but not 1 mg) had similar effects on wool composition but these were of lower magnitude and there was a delay in reaching a maximum response. Even after 16-18 weeks the wool from these treated sheep differed slightly in composition from the pretreatment samples."
4800783	"It is well known that a decrease in vertical height and in horizontal width is seen after tooth extraction. Immediate implant placement, originally thought to prevent buccal wall resorption, showed little or no evident decrease of the resorption rate or pattern in animal experiments or clinical studies. Thus, the need for bone augmentation with immediate implantation has been suggested. However, until recently, simultaneous bone augmentation with immediate implant placement was thought to be possible only in a submerged environment. In this report, the harmony of soft and hard tissue was achieved in 3 patients by immediate implant placement and bone augmentation with transmucosal healing in esthetically challenging situations. Further evaluation is needed to monitor hard- and soft-tissue changes on a long-term basis. Implant placement and bone augmentation with transmucosal healing using demineralized bone matrix may be an option in the treatment of the loss of anterior teeth."
2118849	"Integrins are heterodimers that mediate cell attachment to the extracellular matrix. Previously, we used fibroblast-specific knockout mice to show that the integrin β1 subunit was required in vivo for dermal fibrogenesis and cutaneous tissue repair. Here, we show that integrin β1 expression by fibroblasts is required for dermal homeostasis; at 8 weeks after deletion of integrin β1, the dermis is significantly thinner, expressing less collagen and displaying reduced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Cultured integrin β1-deficient fibroblasts show reduced rac1 activation and ROS generation. Overexpressing rac1 in integrin β1-deficient fibroblasts restored ROS generation; adding hydrogen peroxide to integrin β1-deficient fibroblasts restored Col1a2 (collagen, type I, α2) and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) mRNA expression and α-SMA protein expression and stress fiber formation. Thus integrin β1 expression by fibroblasts is required for the maintenance of dermal connective tissue via a rac/ROS pathway."
7851231	"Genes encoding sterol ester-forming enzymes were recently identified in the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genome. One belongs to a family of six members presenting homologies with the mammalian Lecithin Cholesterol Acyltransferases. The other one belongs to the superfamily of Membrane-Bound O-Acyltransferases. The physiological functions of these genes, Phospholipid Sterol Acyltransferase1 (PSAT1) and Acyl-CoA Sterol Acyltransferase1 (ASAT1), respectively, were investigated using Arabidopsis mutants. Sterol ester content decreased in leaves of all mutants and was strongly reduced in seeds from plants carrying a PSAT1-deficient mutation. The amount of sterol esters in flowers was very close to that of the wild type for all lines studied. This indicated further functional redundancy of sterol acylation in Arabidopsis. We performed feeding experiments in which we supplied sterol precursors to psat1-1, psat1-2, and asat1-1 mutants. This triggered the accumulation of sterol esters (stored in cytosolic lipid droplets) in the wild type and the asat1-1 lines but not in the psat1-1 and psat1-2 lines, indicating a major contribution of the PSAT1 in maintaining free sterol homeostasis in plant cell membranes. A clear biological effect associated with the lack of sterol ester formation in the psat1-1 and psat1-2 mutants was an early leaf senescence phenotype. Double mutants lacking PSAT1 and ASAT1 had identical phenotypes to psat1 mutants. The results presented here suggest that PSAT1 plays a role in lipid catabolism as part of the intracellular processes at play in the maintenance of leaf viability during developmental aging."
5259749	"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and its recurrence after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) are associated with the remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM) components [particularly collagen (Col)], which leads to fibrosis. Our aim was to determine whether the development of antibodies (Abs) to self-antigen Col in HCV-infected patients correlates with the fibrosis stage and the peripheral cytokine response. Patients with chronic HCV infection, patients with HCV recurrence after OLT who had undergone a biopsy procedure, and healthy control subjects were enrolled. The HCV subjects (n = 70) were stratified as follows: (1) a non-OLT group without fibrosis (Scheuer stages 0-2), (2) a non-OLT group with fibrosis (Scheuer stages 3-4), (3) a post-OLT group without fibrosis (Scheuer stages 0-2), and (4) a post-OLT group with fibrosis (Scheuer stages 3-4). Serum samples were analyzed for Abs against Col1, Col2, Col4, Col5, and vimentin with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Serum levels of cytokines were measured with multiplex bead immunoassays. The levels of Abs to Col1 were higher in the fibrosis groups versus the no-fibrosis groups and the controls for both non-OLT patients (P <    0.001) and post-OLT patients (P = 0.01). There were increased levels of Abs to Col2, Col4, Col5, and vimentin in the non-OLT fibrosis group (Col2, P = 0.0001; Col4, P = 0.122; Col5, P <    0.0001; vimentin, P = 0.36) and in the post-OLT fibrosis group (Col2, P = 0.006; Col4, P = 0.19; Col5, P <    0.0001; vimentin, P = 0.24) in comparison with the no-fibrosis groups. The non-OLT and post-OLT fibrosis groups demonstrated significantly higher T helper 2 (T(h) 2) and T helper 17 (T(h) 17) cytokine levels and lower T helper 1 cytokine levels in comparison with the no-fibrosis groups. Our results demonstrate that in HCV-infected patients, the levels of Abs to ECM Col1, Col2, and Col5 positively correlate with liver fibrosis, which is associated with a predominantly T(h) 2 and T(h) 17 cytokine profile."
8182745	"Chemical polymorphism concerning the essential oils of the genus THYMUS is a widespread phenomenon, especially in the northern species. The two Finnish species, T. SERPYLLUM ssp. SERPYLLUM and T. SERPYLLUM ssp. TANAENIS, turned out to form four different chemotypes each, with hedycaryol, germacra-1(10),5-dien-4-ol, germacra-1(10),4-dien-6-ol, linalool, and linalyl acetate as type-characterizing compounds. Otherwise the oils of the two subspecies were similar containing myrcene, TRANS-beta-ocimene, beta-caryophyllene, and germacrene D as the main terpene hydrocarbons. 1,8-Cineol and camphor represented another great portion in both oils. If Finland is regarded as an area of T. SERPYLLUM (s.l.), a total of six types of plants can be defined with regard to the essential oil chemistry only. Including the frequency of these six types at the four areas investigated, a certain gradient from the south to the north can be seen. A most interesting aspect is the fact that the most frequent, linalyl acetate containing chemotype of the northern Lapland has nearly the same oil composition as T. PRAECOX ssp. ARCTICUS in Island, Norway, and Greenland."
2204998	"Accurate preoperative prediction of functional donor and remnant hemiliver volumes in live donor liver transplantation is essential in preventing postoperative liver failure and optimizing safety. Our aim was (1) to evaluate volume variability associated with multiphasic CT imaging and (2) to determine over- or under-estimations of 3-D CT graft-volume assessments based on 'largest' versus 'smallest' CT phases with respect to intraoperative findings. Native, arterial and venous phase CT images from 83 potential live liver donors were subject to 3-D CT liver volume calculations and virtual 3-D liver partitioning. Estimates were compared to intraoperative volumes obtained in 43 cases. Calculated (preoperative) graft-volume-body-weight-ratios (GVBWR) versus measured (intraoperative) graft-weight-body-weight-ratios (GWBWR) were analyzed. Significant differences in total liver volume- and in graft-liver volume calculations were found among the largest (venous) and smallest (native) CT phases. High significant overestimations were observed in graft-volume determinations and in GVBWR-calculations based on the 'largest' CT phase when compared to intraoperatively obtained graft-weight and -GWBWR values. In contrast, differences among intraoperative measurements and preoperative calculations based on the 'smallest' CT phase yielded less significant overestimations. While 3-D CT volumetry based on the 'largest' (venous) CT phase is associated with considerable overestimation, 3-D volumetry based on the 'smallest' (native) CT phase accurately matches the intraoperative findings."
5766220	"In Fabry disease, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and severe neurologic and cardiac complications represent the leading causes of late morbidity and mortality. A comprehensive Italian nationwide survey study was conducted to explore changes in cardiac status and renal allograft function in Fabry patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT) and enzyme replacement therapy (ERT).                                                                              This study was designed as a cross-sectional survey study with prospective follow-up. Of the 34 patients identified via searches in registries, 31 males and 2 females who received RRT and ERT (agalsidase beta in 30 patients, agalsidase alpha in 3) were included. Left ventricular mass index (LVMI), interventricular septal thickness at end diastole (IVSD), left ventricular posterior wall thickness (LVPWT) and renal allograft function were assessed at ERT baseline and subsequently at yearly intervals.                                                                              The patients in the dialysis and transplant groups had been started on dialysis at age 42.0 and 37.1 years (mean), respectively, and patients in the transplant group received their renal allograft at age 39.8 years (mean). The mean age at the start of ERT was similar, 44.1 and 44.6 years, respectively. The mean RRT follow-up was 61.1 and 110.6 months for dialysis and transplant patients, respectively, whereas the ERT duration was 45.1 and 48.4 months, respectively. Cardiac parameters increased in dialysis patients. In transplant patients, mean LVMI seemed to plateau during agalsidase therapy at a lower level as compared to baseline. Decline in renal allograft function was relatively mild (-1.92 ml/min/year). Agalsidase therapy was well tolerated. Serious ERT-unrelated events occurred more often in the dialysis group.                                                                                      Kidney transplantation should be the standard of care for Fabry patients progressing towards ESRD. Transplanted Fabry patients on ERT may do better than patients remaining on maintenance dialysis. Larger, controlled studies in Fabry patients with ESRD will have to demonstrate if ERT is able to change the trajectory of cardiac disease and can preserve graft renal function."
4110372	"A 4-month-old female infant presented with widespread pyoderma gangrenosum associated with stridor, presumed secondary to tracheal involvement. No underlying cause was revealed despite extensive investigation. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents only partially suppressed disease activity. Complete resolution followed treatment with infliximab. We review this rare condition in infants and discuss treatment with infliximab not previously described in this age group."
1018995	"In this study we compared the function and morphology of two types of neural grafts: allografts of fetal ventral mesencephalic (VM) tissue and xenografts of embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived dopamine neurons. Mouse embryonic stem cells were cultured and exposed to differentiation factors that induced approximately 10% of the cells to express a dopaminergic phenotype. These cells were then harvested and implanted into the denervated striatum of rats with unilateral lesions of the nigrostriatal pathway. Another group of lesioned rats received allografts of fetal ventral mesencephalic tissue. While both types of grafts yield a similar number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive cells, amphetamine-induced rotational behavior was differentially affected by these grafts: rotational behavior was significantly reduced in lesioned rats receiving allografts of fetal VM tissue while ESC grafts had slight but insignificant effects on rotational scores. Densitometry measures of TH+ fiber outgrowth revealed a similar area of reinnervation and a comparable number of TH+ cells for ESC graft when compared with VM grafts. These data suggest there are similarities and also distinct differences in the manner in which ESC and VM grafts interact with the denervated striatum."
2193334	"Cytokines participate in host responses to allografts, largely through recruiting and activating various regulatory and effector cells. We performed this study to determine the feasibility of using polymerase chain reaction methodology to define the expression of three important cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-2, and interferon-gamma) in human pulmonary allografts.                                                                              Twenty-six graft-derived samples (11 transbronchial biopsy and 8 macrophage and 7 lymphocyte cell pellets isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage) were obtained from 13 lung transplant recipients and treated as follows: extraction of RNA; reverse transcription of RNA to complementary DNA; polymerase chain reaction amplification of cDNA with oligonucleotide primers specific for the three cytokines; gel electrophoresis of the polymerase chain reaction products; and verification of correct cytokine message by Dot blot technique (with specific 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes).                                                                              Concomitant pathologic evaluation of biopsy specimens from these 13 recipients showed five diagnostic groups: ""normal"" (no rejection/infection), n = 2; acute rejection, n = 4; nonspecific inflammation, n = 3; infection, n = 3; and obliterative bronchiolitis, n = 1. Interleukin-2 was expressed predominantly in acute rejection and infection (seven of ten and five of six samples positive, respectively), whereas tumor necrosis factor-alpha was expressed mainly in nonspecific inflammation (four of five samples) and somewhat less in rejection (six of ten). Interferon-gamma was expressed less frequently (in two of six samples with infection, but in none of ten with rejection and none of five with nonspecific inflammation). Serial data from one patient (6 months apart) showed considerable increase in interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma expression as she progressed from normal histologic status to obliterative bronchiolitis.                                                                                      Cytokine gene transcripts can be determined from minute samples derived directly from pulmonary allografts. Although our data are insufficient to make definitive conclusions, the suggestion of trends of cytokine expression in different posttransplantation pathologic conditions may indicate a useful role for this approach in the clinical evaluation of the lung transplant recipient."
9957842	"The response to daily topical applications of arachidonic acid (0.25-4 mg/ear/day) to the ears of outbred CD-1 mice was monitored. The first application produced erythema, extravasation of plasma proteins resulting in an increase in ear weight, and some neutrophil accumulation (detected histologically and quantified by myeloperoxidase content). The second application produced minimal edema but did cause erythema and a greater accumulation of neutrophils. Subsequent daily application caused erythema, neutrophil accumulation, and an increase in ear weight predominantly due to cell proliferation (epidermis and connective tissue). Daily applications of other unsaturated fatty acids did not match the response induced by arachidonic acid. Mast cell deficient mice (W/Wv) exhibited a smaller edema response to the first dose of arachidonic acid compared to either their wild-type controls or CD-1 mice. In addition, W/Wv mice exhibited a smaller ear weight increase and myeloperoxidase accumulation following eight daily doses of arachidonic acid. However, epidermal proliferation was similar in all the strains of mice tested. These data suggest that the edema caused by the first topical application of arachidonic acid is partly mast cell mediated. Mast cells also appear to be involved in the neutrophil infiltration induced by multiple topical applications, but not in the epidermal proliferation."
8430169	"We retrospectively evaluated the use of double-j stent and the incidence of urological complications in 2 groups of patients who received a kidney transplant. From January 2005 to September 2007 we studied 172 patients receiving kidney transplants, 65 and 107 from living and cadaver donors, respectively. From the 172 patients, a total of 34 were excluded due to ureterostomy or Politano-Leadbetter ureterovesical anastomosis. Another 21 patients were excluded from the study due to graft loss due to acute or hyperacute rejection, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, or vascular complication. The remaining patients were divided into 2 groups: group A (44 patients) and B (73 patients) with versus without the use of a double-j-stent, respectively. The 2 groups were comparable in terms of donor and recipient gender, ischemia time, and delayed graft function. We failed to observes significant differences between the 2 groups in mean hospital stay (23 +/- 9 and 19 +/- 9), urinary leak (2.3% and 4.1%), and urinary tract infection (20.4% and 19.2%), among groups A and B, respectively. The only difference observed concerned the gravity of the urinary leak; no surgical intervention was needed among the double-j stent group versus 2 patients demanding ureterovesical reconstruction in the nonstent group. In conclusion, our data suggested that the routine use of a double-j stent for ureterovesical anastomosis neither significantly increased urinary tract infection rates, nor decreased the incidence of urinary leaks, but may decrease the gravity of the latter as evidenced by the need for surgical intervention."
4911677	"Different plant parts varied in copper sulfate (CuSO(4)) and cadmium sulfate (CdSO(4))-induced ethylene production, inflorescences showed the greatest induction, while all other plant parts tested produced significantly less. Leaf age had a dramatic effect on CuSO(4) and CdSO(4)-induced ethylene production with the youngest leaves showing the greatest stimulation and as the age of the leaf increased there was a reduction in their ability to produce ethylene. However, there was no significant difference in CuSO(4), CdSO(4) and wound-induced ethylene production when whole rosettes were taken from plants that were 7, 14 or 21-day-old. The highest amount of CuSO(4) and CdSO(4)-induced ethylene production was produced in the root tip with regions below this producing less. CuSO(4) and CdSO(4)-induced ethylene production was also greatest from the tip of the inflorescence to 2cm below the tip and from this point down there was a reduction in ethylene production. When inflorescence stalks or leaves were treated with CuSO(4) or CdSO(4) over a range of concentrations from 0 to 800microM, there was an increase in ethylene production starting at 50microM with increasingly greater responses up to 400microM. There was no further increase at the 800microM CuSO(4) concentration; however, there was a slight decline with 800microM CdSO(4). Inflorescence stalks or leaves treated with either 400microM CuSO(4) or CdSO(4) exhibited a dramatic increase in ethylene production 2h following treatment initiation and remained high over a 24-h period with a decline in ethylene production after this time in inflorescence stalks but not the leaves. It was found that light caused a dramatic decrease in CuSO(4), CdSO(4) and wound-induced ethylene production in both inflorescence stalks and leaves. When inflorescence stalks or leaves were treated at 43 degrees C, there was a dramatic effect on CuSO(4), CdSO(4) and wound-induced ethylene production in each."
1389250	"Cutaneous manifestations in renal transplant recipients are frequently represented by infections and cancerous lesions. However, dermatologic lesions secondary to autoimmune diseases are rare. We report a case of pustular psoriasis occurring after renal transplantation in a 31-year-old woman with a history of vitiligo. The patient was on hemodialysis for 2 years for undetermined chronic nephropathy. She received an HLA identical live related transplant from her brother. She was maintained on an immunosuppressive regimen of corticosteroids, azathioprine, and cyclosporine, which was replaced with mycophenolate mofetil because of neurotoxicity and azathioprine was stopped. Thirty-one months after renal transplantation, she developed pustular psoriasis which was treated with retinoids; she experienced a relapse and resistance to treatment despite the reintroduction of cyclosporine."
7445571	"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) of superficial basal cell carcinomas using endogenous protoporphyrin IX generated by topically applied 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) is an innovative and clinically encouraging approach.                                                                                  This paper reports on the first results of an ongoing clinical study on photodynamic therapy of 55 basal cell carcinomas in 19 patients.                                                                              Because of the chemical instability of 5-ALA, a novel nanocolloid lotion was developed. This formulation was applied to the lesions under occlusive dressing 6 h before irradiation with visible light from an unfiltered halogen lamp. Light-induced fluorescence was used to ascertain the superficial extension of the tumors. The response to the therapy was assessed by visual inspection and in 13 patients also by biopsies.                                                                              After a single treatment, 47 (85%) basal cell carcinomas showed a complete response at a follow-up time of at least 6 months. For the remaining 8 (15%) lesions, a partial response was observed, indicated by a marked reduction of the tumor size. The treatment modality without local anesthetics was well tolerated by all patients, with only slight discomfort during light irradiation.                                                                                     Our results indicate that 5-ALA-PDT with our novel formulation, a nanocolloid lotion, is a highly effective and convenient therapy for the treatment of superficial basal cell carcinomas. Its use in the treatment of nodular tumors needs further investigations."
4686123	"Our aim was to assess the medium-time results after orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) depending on the serostatus of heart transplant recipients at the time of transplantation.                                                                                            We enrolled 120 patients in this retrospective study including 107 males and an overall mean age of 49.1 +/- 8.6 years ischemic heart disease (IHD) was the diagnosis before OHT in 46%. The mean follow-up was 48 months. The first diagnostic coronary angiography was routinely preformed at 1 year after OHT, and then every second year. We evaluated every incidence of a change in the coronary arteries, the presence of significant stenosis (requiring percutaneous coronary intervention), acute myocardial infarction, death, or retransplantation. Using indirect immunofluorescence assays we detected Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antigenemia by identification of antibodies against early antigens of EBV (EA) of IgM and IgG classes as well as IgG antibodies against nuclear antigen of EBV (EBNA). Since April 2001 all three types of antibodies were routinely investigated on admission to the hospital for OHT.                                                                              At the time of transplantation, IgM-EA antibodies were detected in 17 (14%) patients, IgG-EA in 35 (29%), and IgG-EBNA in 113 (94%). Survival rate, incidence of cardiac allograft vasculopathy and death, as a function of the serostatus of the heart recipient at the time of transplantation were estimated by Kaplan-Meier curves; the results were compared by log-rank tests. The findings among IgM EA, IgG EA, and IgG EBNA-positive and -negative groups were statistically comparable.                                                                                     Infection with EBV before OHT did not worsen the prognosis over the first 4 years after transplantation."
2077315	"Despite the great efficacy of current antiviral preventive strategies, hCMV infection is still a major complication after renal transplantation, significantly challenging patient and graft survival. This issue seems to be explained because of the rather poor immunologic monitoring of the antiviral immune response. An important body of evidence has shown that monitoring the hCMV-specific T-cell response, at different time points of the transplant setting, seems to add crucial information for predicting the risk of viral infection, thus potentially helping individualization of therapeutic decision-making in clinical transplantation. While several immune-cellular assays have shown its capability for accurately monitoring hCMV-specific T-cell responses, only few such as the IFN-γ ELISPOT and the ELISA based technology assays might be reliable for its application in the clinic. Nonetheless, an important effort has to be made among the transplant community to standardize and validate such immune assays. Noteworthy, large-scale prospective randomized trials are highly warranted to ultimately introduce them in current clinical practice as a part of the highly desired personalized medicine."

We examined 254 consecutive kidney transplant recipients with positive virtual crossmatch and negative flow crossmatch.                                                                              A total of 111 patients (43%) developed CMV disease or BK infection or nephropathy (BKVN). Specifically, 78 patients (30.7%) developed BK infection, 19 (7.5%) had BKVN, and 33 (12.9%) presented with CMV disease. Four patients (1.5%) developed both infections. Mean time from transplant to diagnosis for BK and CMV was 4.07 ± 3.10 and 8.35 ± 5.20 months, respectively.

Thymoglobulin induction (HR, 2.50; 95% CI, 1.02-6.13; P = 0.04), and peak PRA greater than 80% (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.23-0.86; P = 0.02) remained significant predictors of infection after multivariate adjustment.                                                                                      Although more than 40% of patients with a positive virtual crossmatch presented with BK infection/CMV disease, high PRA greater than 80% seemed to be protective."
4652730	A case of annular lipoatrophy of the ankles in a 4-year-old girl is presented. Histologically a lobular lymphohistiocytic panniculitis with masses of foam cells was present.

The clinical and histopathological findings were compatible with the diagnosis of generalized eruptive histiocytoma. The ultrastructural findings in this case suggest that this condition which is in the non-X group of histiocytic disorders is closely related to histiocytosis X."
7502604	"The roles of auxin and cytokinin in cell cycle reactivation were studied during the first 48 h of culture of mesophyll protoplasts of Nicotiana tabacum. Using hormone delay and withdrawal studies we found that auxin was required by 0-4 h of culture, whereas cytokinin was not required until hour 10-12, which is 6-10 h before S phase. Cycloheximide blocks division, indicating that protein synthesis is required. In an effort to detect a molecular response to either hormone, we examined the expression of the cell cycle marker, cdc2. Cdc2 expression was detected by 12 h of culture, coincident with the timing of the cytokinin requirement and well before the entry into S. However, cdc2 was partially induced by either auxin or cytokinin alone, suggesting that cdc2 expression is not the primary target of either hormone. Our hormone delay experiments suggest that there are separate signal transduction pathways leading from auxin and from cytokinin to reactivation of the cell cycle and that these pathways converge before S. The underlying mechanisms for these distinct pathways remain to be elucidated. Key Words. Auxin-Cytokinin-Tobacco-Protoplast-Development-cdc2"
3561986	"Barley (Hordeum vulgare) primary leaves synthesize saponarin, a 2-fold glucosylated flavone (apigenin 6-C-glucosyl-7-O-glucoside), which is efficiently accumulated in vacuoles via a transport mechanism driven by the proton gradient. Vacuoles isolated from mesophyll protoplasts of the plant line anthocyanin-less310 (ant310), which contains a mutation in the chalcone isomerase (CHI) gene that largely inhibits flavonoid biosynthesis, exhibit strongly reduced transport activity for saponarin and its precursor isovitexin (apigenin 6-C-glucoside). Incubation of ant310 primary leaf segments or isolated mesophyll protoplasts with naringenin, the product of the CHI reaction, restores saponarin biosynthesis almost completely, up to levels of the wild-type Ca33787. During reconstitution, saponarin accumulates to more than 90% in the vacuole. The capacity to synthesize saponarin from naringenin is strongly reduced in ant310 miniprotoplasts containing no central vacuole. Leaf segments and protoplasts from ant310 treated with naringenin showed strong reactivation of saponarin or isovitexin uptake by vacuoles, while the activity of the UDP-glucose:isovitexin 7-O-glucosyltransferase was not changed by this treatment. Our results demonstrate that efficient vacuolar flavonoid transport is linked to intact flavonoid biosynthesis in barley. Intact flavonoid biosynthesis exerts control over the activity of the vacuolar flavonoid/H(+)-antiporter. Thus, the barley ant310 mutant represents a novel model system to study the interplay between flavonoid biosynthesis and the vacuolar storage mechanism."
1850522	"Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) represent an important clinical problem resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Ongoing translational research studies strive to better understand molecular/cellular basis of DFU pathology that may lead to identification of novel treatment protocols. Tissue at the non-healing wound edge has been identified as one of major contributors to the DFU pathophysiology that provides important tool for translational and clinical investigations. To evaluate quality of tissue specimens and their potential use, we obtained 81 DFU specimens from 25 patients and performed histological analyses, immunohistochemistry and RNA quality assessments. We found that depth of the collected specimen is important determinant of research utility, and only specimens containing a full-thickness epidermis could be utilized for immunohistochemistry and RNA isolation. We showed that only two-thirds of collected specimens could be utilized in translational studies. This attrition rate is important for designs of future studies involving tissue specimen collection from DFU."
8885674	"Attempts were made to establish models to study interactions between marrow stromal cells and hematopoietic cells in vivo. The approach was to create a NOD-SCID-hu murine model of long-term human hematopoiesis by implantation of a human adult bone fragment. Nine to 12 weeks posttransplantation, human CD45+ cells were detected in the blood and the spleen of some mice. The histology of the human transplant showed that human bone fragment was viable at 9 weeks. Moreover, vessels of human origin, as assessed by immunohistochemical detection of human beta2-microglobulin, were observed in the mouse tissue surrounding the transplanted human fragment."
9836835	"Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria are increasingly being seen as a way of complementing conventional inputs in agricultural systems. The effects on their host plants are diverse and include volatile-mediated growth enhancement. This study sought to assess the effects of bacterial volatiles on the biomass production and root system architecture of the model grass Brachypodium distachyon (L.) Beauv.                                                                              An in vitro experiment allowing plant-bacteria interaction throughout the gaseous phase without any physical contact was used to screen 19 bacterial strains for their growth-promotion ability over a 10-day co-cultivation period. Five groups of bacteria were defined and characterised based on their combined influence on biomass production and root system architecture. The observed effects ranged from unchanged to greatly increased biomass production coupled with increased root length and branching. Primary root length was increased only by the volatile compounds emitted by Enterobacter cloacae JM22 and Bacillus pumilus T4. Overall, the most significant results were obtained with Bacillus subtilis GB03, which induced an 81 % increase in total biomass, as well as enhancing total root length, total secondary root length and total adventitious root length by 88.5, 201.5 and 474.5 %, respectively.                                                                                      This study is the first report on bacterial volatile-mediated growth promotion of a grass plant. Contrasting modulations of biomass production coupled with changes in root system architecture were observed. Most of the strains that increased total plant biomass also modulated adventitious root growth. Under our screening conditions, total biomass production was strongly correlated with the length and branching of the root system components, except for primary root length. An analysis of the emission kinetics of the bacterial volatile compounds is being undertaken and should lead to the identification of the compounds responsible for the observed growth-promotion effects. Within the context of the inherent characteristics of our in vitro system, this paper identifies the next critical experimental steps and discusses them from both a fundamental and an applied perspective."
7051576	"The transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is an important treatment for complications of portal hypertension. As some authors have suggested that TIPS may facilitate liver transplantation technically, the objective of this study was to determine the impact of TIPS on the liver transplant operation and its outcome.                                                                              The analysis was designed as a retrospective cohort study using a multicenter database. Fifty-five patients with TIPS were matched with 55 controls on the basis of 10 pretransplant laboratory, clinical, and demographic features. TIPS patients and control patients were compared with regard to duration of surgery, intraoperative blood product usage, liver and renal function, volume of ascites, survival, and hospital stay. For confirmatory purposes, a parallel analysis using linear regression methods was performed.                                                                              By matched analysis, TIPS patients had less ascites at surgery (mean 0.9+/-0.20 vs. 2.2+/-0.37 L, P=0.005) and a slightly shorter time from incision to cross-clamp (mean 2.1+/-0.10 vs. 2.5+/-0.15 hr, P=0.03). However, there were not significant differences for total operative time (mean 6.0+/-0.17 vs. 6.3+/-0.25 hr, P=1.00), blood product usage, or any other outcome variable. Regression analysis confirmed these results.                                                                                      TIPS does not significantly impact the course of liver transplantation surgery. Therefore, preoperative portal decompression solely to facilitate liver transplantation is not an appropriate indication for TIPS."
8677805	"Programmed cell death (PCD) is a crucial process both for plant development and responses to biotic and abiotic stress. There is accumulating evidence that chloroplasts may play a central role during plant PCD as for mitochondria in animal cells, but it is still unclear whether they participate in PCD onset, execution, or both. To tackle this question, we have analyzed the contribution of chloroplast function to the cell death phenotype of the myoinositol phosphate synthase1 (mips1) mutant that forms spontaneous lesions in a light-dependent manner. We show that photosynthetically active chloroplasts are required for PCD to occur in mips1, but this process is independent of the redox state of the chloroplast. Systematic genetic analyses with retrograde signaling mutants reveal that 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphate, a chloroplast retrograde signal that modulates nuclear gene expression in response to stress, can inhibit cell death and compromises plant innate immunity via inhibition of the RNA-processing 5'-3' exoribonucleases. Our results provide evidence for the role of chloroplast-derived signal and RNA metabolism in the control of cell death and biotic stress response."

6824821	"Although arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) are actively promoted, their use at the start of haemodialysis (HD) seems to be decreasing worldwide. In this paper, we describe recent trends in incidence and prevalence of vascular access types in Europe from 2005 to 2009 and their relationship with patient characteristics and survival.                                                                              Ten European renal registries participating in the ERA-EDTA Registry provided data on incidence (n = 13,044) and/or prevalence (n = 75,715) of vascular access types. We used logistic regression to assess which factors influence the likelihood to be treated with an AVF rather than another type.                                                                              The use of AVFs at the start of HD showed a significant decreasing trend from 42% in 2005 to 32% in 2009 (P <    0.0001), while the use of central venous catheters (CVCs) increased from 58 to 68% (P <    0.0001). A similar evolution pattern was observed for the prevalence; use of AVFs decreased from 66 to 62% and use of CVCs increased from 28 to 32%. There was a large international variation in the use of the different vascular access types. Female patients [adjusted odds ratio: 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.78-0.90] and those ≥80 years (0.77, 95% CI: 0.67-0.90) were least likely to start HD with an AVF.                                                                                     In Europe, there is a decreasing trend in the use of AVFs and an increasing trend in the use of CVCs at the start and after the start of HD. We cannot explain all between-country variations we found, and more research is needed to clarify how healthcare around vascular access is organized in Europe."
8983701	"Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS) is a rare genetic disease which causes a variety of dermatological lesions, especially basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), often on the face, neck, and head.                                                                              Persons attending a national NBCCS support group meeting were asked to participate in survey-based assessments of quality of life and depressive symptoms. Inclusion criteria required a self-reported NBCCS diagnosis, voluntary agreement to participate, and age over 18 years. Exclusion criteria included cognitive impairment. Skin-related quality of life was assessed with Skindex-29, completed by 32 participants. Depressive symptomatology was determined with the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), completed by 18 participants. Sociodemographic, medical, and social variables were also analyzed.                                                                              Median Skindex-29 scores for the emotions, symptoms, and functioning scales were 42.50, 32.14, and 28.13, respectively (means: 41.17, 37.05, and 29.30, respectively). These scores were slightly higher than those observed in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1, a similar genetic disease with skin symptoms. The CES-D scores (median = 15.50, mean = 17.50) suggested that 50% of participants had significant depressive symptomatology. Variables showing moderate associations with the scores included diet, number of affected family members, and treatment type. Interestingly, the number of BCCs had no effect.                                                                                      Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome impacts the quality of life of its subjects in a similar manner to other genodermatoses. Depressive symptoms are particularly prevalent. Several demographic, medical, and social characteristics affect these outcomes. Thus, the psychological impact of this disorder should be evaluated in the course of considering the care of persons with NBCCS."
3176034	"We performed a cross-sectional study of Hispanic and non-Hispanic parents of children with acne using a survey designed to determine their level of awareness of acne and its treatment; 82% of Hispanic parents and 40% of non-Hispanic parents agreed that a health care provider should treat mild acne (p <    0.001). Hispanic parents of adolescents with acne agreed more frequently than non-Hispanic parents that children with mild and moderate acne should be taken to a health care provider for treatment, but they tended not to visit health care providers. Future studies should aim to determine the reasons for this discrepancy, after which culturally sensitive educational programs can be developed to address this disparity."
5974038	"Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a unicellular green alga, grows photoautotrophically at very low concentrations of inorganic carbon due to the presence of an inducible CO2-concentrating mechanism. During the induction of the CO2-concentrating mechanism at low-CO2 growth conditions, at least five polypeptides that are either absent or present in low amounts in cells grown on high-CO2 concentrations are induced. One of these induced polypeptides with a molecular mass of 36 kD, LIP-36, has been localized to the chloroplast envelope. The protein was purified and the partial internal amino acid sequences were obtained through lys-C digestion. Two cDNAs encoding LIP-36 have been cloned using degenerate primers based on the amino acid sequences. The two genes encoding LIP-36 are highly homologous in the coding region but are completely different in the 5'-end and 3'-end untranslated regions. The deduced protein sequences show strong homology to the mitochondrial carrier protein superfamily, suggesting that LIP-36 is a chloroplast carrier protein. The regulation of the expression of these two genes at high- and low-CO2 growth conditions is also different. Both genes were highly expressed under low-CO2 growth conditions, with the steady-state level of LIP-36 G1 mRNA more abundant. However, neither gene was expressed at high-CO2 growth conditions. The gene products of both clones expressed in Escherichia coli were recognized by an antibody raised against LIP-36, confirming that the two cDNAs indeed encode the C. reinhardtii chloroplast envelope carrier protein LIP-36."
4620329	"This review summarizes new treatments from the last seven years employed for the treatment of genital warts caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). Imquimod 3.75% is a new agent with fewer side effects and perhaps a better dosing schedule than imquimod 5%, but is not more effective. Sinecatechins/Polyphenon E 15%, a novel extract from green tea can be effective against genital warts but requires three times a day dosing and is not more effective than existing treatments; the treatment course is 12-16 weeks. Photodynamic therapy combined with other destructive modalities might increase the cure rate for genital warts. The quadrivalent vaccine against HPV 6, 11, 16, 18 is decreasing the incidence of warts in the western world but the evidence does not support vaccination as a treatment for those already infected by HPV. Hyperthermia and immunomodulators might be positive additions to the armamentarium of clinicians. In sum, there are new tools that physicians can use but none is really a great advance over what was available a decade ago."
4904469	"Use of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in kidney transplantation has led to significant improvements in the acute rejection index and graft survival. Posttransplant MMF levels are known to be of value for discriminating patients at risk of acute rejection. Trough MMF levels were measured in 153 patients who had undergone kidney transplantation more than 1 year before and showed stable graft function. MMF dosage was adjusted based on hematologic or gastrointestinal toxicity. The quotient between the weight-adjusted dose and through MMF levels was calculated in order to establish absorption type. We analyzed the diagnostic value of this quotient in relation to creatinine proteinuria, hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity based upon percentiles of 10, 25, 50, 75, and 90, which were used as cutoff points. Mean MMF levels were 3.79 +/- 3.3 mg/L. Mean quotient value was 6.55 +/- 9.2. A significant correlation was found between MMF dosage and MMF trough levels (r = .34, P <    .01). However, no correlation was seen between MMF dosage and the quotient. There were no significant differences in the analyzed parameters and the percentiles established as cutoff points. However, patients with gastrointestinal toxicity had a larger quotient (9.07 +/- 7.45.3 vs 5.28 +/- 4.9). The relationship between MMF dose and levels does not establish differences in kidney function and proteinuria among stable transplant patients; patients with diarrhea may show decreased absorption."
4799687	"Pruritus can be a distressing and even debilitating symptom for patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). To date, few studies have evaluated the pathophysiology of this symptom. Because of this, therapy for pruritus in CTCL has mainly relied on those therapies that target and treat the lymphoma. For patients living with CTCL that relapses or becomes refractory to treatment, and who continue to experience severe itch, this lymphoma-targeted treatment may not be enough to combat their pruritus. Therefore, other itch-targeted therapies are needed for use in this disease.                                                                                  We sought to evaluate the current evidence regarding the mechanism of action and treatments for pruritus associated with CTCL.                                                                              An explicit and thorough search was restricted to all peer-reviewed literature available through MEDLINE (1950 to September 2011) and PubMed. Search terms used were ""pruritus,"" ""cutaneous T-cell lymphoma,"" ""CTCL,"" ""mycosis fungoides,"" ""MF,"" and ""Sézary syndrome."" All studies that involved pruritus in CTCL, mycosis fungoides, or Sézary syndrome were evaluated by all 3 authors.                                                                              The current literature helps to identify therapies and possible mechanisms for treating patients with CTCL-associated pruritus.                                                                                     Most studies were preclinical. Only studies involving mechanisms of action or treatment were included.                                                                                     A guideline is necessary to assist in the treatment of pruritus in CTCL and additional studies are necessary to uncover the exact mechanism or mechanisms of action."
3329065	"Although papulonecrotic tuberculid is an uncommon cutaneous manifestation of tuberculosis (TB) associated with Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, the simultaneous occurrence of papulonecrotic tuberculid and erythema induratum is even rarer. Papulonecrotic tuberculid occurs predominantly in young adults and is characterized by eruptions of necrotizing papules that heal with varioliform scars. Histopathologic findings include wedge-shaped necrosis of the dermis, poorly formed granulomatous infiltration, and vasculitis. Stainings and culture for acid-fast bacilli from skin biopsies are usually negative for M. tuberculosis, although the eruptions resolve with antitubercular therapy. Few patients with papulonecrotic tuberculid, especially with concurrent occurrence of erythema induratum, have been reported in the English literature. Here we report a case of a 12-year-old girl with simultaneous occurrence of papulonecrotic tuberculid and erythema induratum accompanying pulmonary TB."
3394306	"Intermediate-conductance, calcium-activated potassium channels (IKs) modulate proliferation and differentiation in mesodermal cells by enhancing calcium influx, and they contribute to the physiology of fluid movement in certain epithelia. Previous reports suggest that IK channels stimulate proliferative growth in a keratinocyte cell line; however, because these channels indirectly promote calcium influx, a critically unique component of the keratinocyte differentiation program, an alternative hypothesis is that they would be anti-proliferative and pro-differentiating. This study addresses these hypotheses.                                                                              Real-time PCR, patch clamp electrophysiology, and proliferation assays were used to determine if human IK1 (hIK1) expression and function are correlated with either proliferation or differentiation in cultured human skin epidermal keratinocytes, and skin biopsies grown in explant culture.                                                                              hIK1 mRNA expression in human keratinocytes and skin was increased in response to anti-proliferative/pro-differentiating stimuli (elevated calcium and Vitamin D). Correspondingly, the hIK1 agonist 1-EBIO inhibited keratinocyte proliferation suggesting that the channel could be anti-proliferative and pro-differentiating. However, this proliferative inhibition by 1-EBIO was not reversed by a panel of hIK1 blockers, calling into question the mechanism of 1-EBIO action. Subsequent patch clamp electrophysiological analysis failed to detect hIK1 channel currents in keratinocytes, even those expressing substantial hIK1 mRNA in response to calcium and Vitamin D induced differentiation. Identical electrophysiological recording conditions were then used to observe robust IK1 currents in fibroblasts which express IK1 mRNA levels comparable to those of keratinocytes. Thus, the absence of observable hIK1 currents in keratinocytes was not a function of the electrophysiological techniques.                                                                                     Human keratinocyte differentiation is stimulated by calcium mobilization and influx, and differentiation stimuli coordinately upregulate mRNA levels of the calcium-activated hIK1 channel. This upregulation is paradoxical in that functional hIK1 channels are not observed in cultured keratinocytes. It appears, therefore, that hIK1 does not contribute to the functional electrophysiology of primary human keratinocytes, nor intact human skin. Further, the results indicate caution is required when interpreting experiments utilizing pharmacological hIK1 modulators in human keratinocytes."
8923778	"Little is known about the recurrence/persistence rates of dysplastic nevi (DN) after biopsy, and whether incompletely removed DN should be re-excised to prevent recurrence.                                                                                  Our purpose was to determine the recurrence rates of previously biopsied DN, and to assess whether biopsy method, margin involvement, congenital features, epidermal location, and degree of dysplasia are associated with recurrence.                                                                              Patients having a history of a ""nevus biopsy"" at least 2 years earlier were assessed for clinical recurrence. Slides of original lesions were re-reviewed by a dermatopathologist.                                                                              A total of 271 nevus biopsy sites were assessed in 115 patients. Of 195 DN with greater than 2 years of follow-up, 7 (3.6%) demonstrated recurrence on clinical examination. In all, 98 DN had a follow-up period of at least 4 years with no clinical recurrence. Of 61 benign nevus biopsy sites examined, clinical recurrence was observed in two (3.3%). For all nevi, recurrence was significantly associated with shave biopsy technique but not with nevus dysplasia or subtype, or the presence of positive margin or congenital features.                                                                                      Most biopsies were performed in a pigmented lesion clinic at a single tertiary referral center. Determinations of nevus recurrence were made on clinical rather than histologic grounds, and follow-up times were limited in some cases.                                                                                     In this cohort, rates of clinical recurrence after biopsy of DN and benign nevi were extremely low. Re-excision of nevi, including mildly to moderately DN with a positive margin, may not be necessary."
9392109	"Oxalate-producing plants accumulate calcium oxalate crystals (CaOx(c)) in the range of 3-80% w/w of their dry weight, reducing calcium (Ca) bioavailability. The calcium oxalate deficient 5 (cod5) mutant of Medicago truncatula has been previously shown to contain similar Ca concentrations to wild-type (WT) plants, but lower oxalate and CaOx(c) concentrations. We imaged the Ca distribution in WT and cod5 leaflets via synchrotron X-ray fluorescence mapping (SXRF). We observed a difference in the Ca distribution between cod5 and WT leaflets, manifested as an abundance of Ca in the interveinal areas and a lack of Ca along the secondary veins in cod5, i.e. the opposite of what is observed in WT. X-ray microdiffraction (μXRD) of M. truncatula leaves confirmed that crystalline CaOx(c) (whewellite; CaC2 O4 · H2 O) was present in the WT only, in cells sheathing the secondary veins. Together with μXRD, microbeam Ca K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy (μXANES) indicated that, among the forms of CaOx, i.e. crystalline or amorphous, only amorphous CaOx was present in cod5. These results demonstrate that deletion of COD5 changes both Ca localization and the form of CaOx within leaflets."

8329951	"One nonenzymic and two enzymic forms of ascorbate peroxidase were found in pea leaves, and designated A, B and C. Form A was due to a low molecular weight, heat-stable component, and could be separated from the enzymic forms by gel filtration. Forms B and C were soluble proteins with an apparent molecular weight of 57,000. These two forms could be separated by cation-exchange chromatography on CM-Sephadex C-50. This technique was incorporated into a procedure for their partial purification. Several properties of B and C were found to be similar: they were active over a wide pH range (5 to 8), they displayed very high affinities for H(2)O(2) (Km<   5 μM), and Km values for ascorbate (6.5 mM and 2.9 mM, respectively) were comparable to physiological concentrations of this substrate. These properties are considered conducive to the proposed physiological role of ascorbate peroxidase, viz prevention of H(2)O(2) accumulation."
2647937	"The perfusion of human renal allografts with CD45-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) may reduce their immunogenicity and the incidence of rejection. We performed a safety study in 40 patients receiving their first cadaveric renal transplant. Two milligrams each of the rat CD45 specific mAbs YTH 24.5 and YTH 54.12 were perfused into the grafts prior to transplantation. The patients were followed for 3 months. No patient died, and four grafts were lost, three to vascular causes not considered to be related to antibody perfusion and one to severe rejection. Two patients developed an anti-rat antibody response. Immunohistological double-labelling performed on cortical biopsies taken post-perfusion and prior to wound closure showed that at least 60% of the CD45+ cells were coated by perfused anti-CD45 ('antibody uptake'). Among the patients studied for uptake and episodes of rejection, the incidence of rejection was 75% in 12 patients whose antibody uptake was <    95% compared with 22% in 18 patients with antibody uptake >    or = 95% (P = 0.01). We conclude that this treatment was free of adverse effects and that there is a correlation between the uptake of antibody by passenger leucocytes and reduction in acute rejection episodes."
1284852	"Accidental ingestion of medication intended for topical use occurred in two patients. A patient hospitalized for psoriasis mistakenly swallowed potassium permanganate tablets intended for use in her bathwater. Another patient ingested tablets intended to prepare Burow's solution for topical treatment of his wound infection. These types of accidental ingestion of medicine intended for topical use are, fortunately, uncommon and do not usually lead to complications. However, the current trend to unit dosing, especially in tablet form, may result in the more frequent occurrence of such accidents."
8828161	"Auxin directs plant ontogenesis via differential accumulation within tissues depending largely on the activity of PIN proteins that mediate auxin efflux from cells and its directional cell-to-cell transport. Regardless of the developmental importance of PINs, the structure of these transporters is poorly characterized. Here, we present experimental data concerning protein topology of plasma membrane-localized PINs. Utilizing approaches based on pH-dependent quenching of fluorescent reporters combined with immunolocalization techniques, we mapped the membrane topology of PINs and further cross-validated our results using available topology modeling software. We delineated the topology of PIN1 with two transmembrane (TM) bundles of five α-helices linked by a large intracellular loop and a C-terminus positioned outside the cytoplasm. Using constraints derived from our experimental data, we also provide an updated position of helical regions generating a verisimilitude model of PIN1. Since the canonical long PINs show a high degree of conservation in TM domains and auxin transport capacity has been demonstrated for Arabidopsis representatives of this group, this empirically enhanced topological model of PIN1 will be an important starting point for further studies on PIN structure-function relationships. In addition, we have established protocols that can be used to probe the topology of other plasma membrane proteins in plants."
2372918	BACKGROUND: Etanercept is a fully human tumor necrosis factor a receptor fusion protein that binds tumor necrosis factor a with greater affinity than natural receptors. Biologics are widely used in the treatment of psoriasis and psoriasis arthritis and may represent a new therapeutic option for some patients with psoriatic nail disease. CASE REPORT: We report a case of lichen planus limited to the toe nails successfully treated with etanercept monotherapy. CONCLUSION: The significant improvement of our case suggests that etanercept is an effective treatment modality for lichen planus limited particularly to the nails. Further controlled studies are needed to establish the effectiveness and therapeutic regimes.
7070404	"A major risk factor for skin cancer is UV irradiation, which not only damages DNA and other photosensitive compounds like vitamin A, but may also perturb cellular signaling, e.g. via the retinoid receptor system believed to be important for cancer protection. We used cultured normal human keratinocytes and melanocytes to examine the effects of UV irradiation on the expression of the predominant retinoid receptors in the human skin (RARalpha, RARgamma and RXRalpha) and the AP-1 protein c-Jun; mRNA levels were studied by real-time PCR and protein levels by Western blot. In keratinocytes, a single dose of UVB (50 mJ/cm2) caused a rapid drop in the expression of all three receptors (mRNA levels minus 35-50% after 4 h; protein levels minus 20-45% after 8 h), which was followed over the next 40 h by a variable response, leading to full normalization for RARalpha only. In contrast, the levels of c-Jun did not change significantly after UV exposure. In melanocytes, UVB caused a similar drop of the retinoid receptor levels as in keratinocytes but this was soon followed by an increased expression leading to a complete normalization of all receptor levels within 1-3 days. The c-Jun levels in melanocytes increased 1 day after UV exposure and remained high (plus 50%) thereafter. In both cell types, a approximately 3-fold increase in apoptosis (measured by DNA fragmentation) was observed 8-48 h after UVB irradiation. In conclusion, a depletion of vitamin A and retinoid receptors by UV irradiation, together with unchanged or even increased c-Jun levels, might seriously interfere with retinoid signaling and thus promote future tumor development, especially in keratinocytes."
6789869	"Porto-caval hemitransposition (PCH) in liver transplantation allows revascularization of the liver when the porto-mesenteric axis is thrombosed. We, here, review our experience over an 11-year period. A total of 23 patients underwent liver transplantation using PCH. Immunosuppression was based on tacrolimus, with sirolimus used in case of renal insufficiency. Most common diagnoses were hepatitis C, Laennec's, Budd-Chiari and cryptogenic cirrhosis. Six patients needed splenectomy prior to transplant, 5 during transplant, 1 post-transplant, 11 had no splenectomy. Overall survival was 60% at 1 year and 38% at 3 years, with 10 of 23 patients currently alive and the longest survivor at 9.3 years. Most common cause of death was sepsis/multisystem organ failure, followed by pulmonary embolism. A total of 7/23 patients experienced post-operative gastrointestinal bleeding episodes, 6/23 patients developed thrombosis of the vena cava (median 162 days post-op). Post-operative ascites was noted in almost all patients. Renal dysfunction was commonly seen even after the first month post-transplant. PCH offers a feasible option for liver transplantation in those patients with complex thrombosis of the mesenteric and portal circulation."

7429220	"Long-term oral 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) and UVA (PUVA) therapy increases the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer and possibly also of cutaneous malignant melanoma. Topical application of 8-MOP PUVA induces malignant tumors in rodent skin, but little is known about its carcinogenicity in human skin.                                                                                  Our purpose was to investigate the carcinogenicity of 8-MOP bath PUVA in humans.                                                                              This was a cohort study of 158 patients with psoriasis, for whom 8-MOP bath PUVA had been initiated during 1979 to 1992. The average number of 8-MOP bath PUVA treatments was 36 (range, 6 to 204) and the mean cumulative UVA dose was 92 J/cm2 (range, 3 to 884 J/cm2) by the end of 1995. The patients were not treated with any other forms of PUVA. Cancer incidence subsequent to 8-MOP bath PUVA up to the end of 1995 was determined by linking the cohort with the records of the Finnish Cancer Registry. The standardized incidence ratios (SIR) were calculated for skin cancer and some common internal cancers, using the expected numbers of cases based on the regional cancer incidence rates.                                                                              There was one case of basal cell carcinoma, but no cases of other types of skin cancer. A total of 6 noncutaneous cancers were observed (SIR, 1.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.5 to 2.8).                                                                                     No association between cutaneous cancer and 8-MOP bath PUVA was found, but the statistical power of this study alone is not adequate to warrant definite conclusions. The results can be used in a meta-analysis as soon as other studies on the carcinogenicity of 8-MOP bath PUVA are published."
4600934	"Of 2457 patients in the North American Pediatric Renal Transplant Cooperative Study registry who were followed for 5481 patient-years after the index transplantation, we observed 136 deaths, for an average annual rate of 24.8 deaths per 1000 patient-years. Death resulted primarily from infection (n = 55, 40%), cardiovascular causes (n = 28, 21%), hemorrhage (n = 16, 12%), and malignancies (n = 9, 7%). Cadaver-donor source was associated with greater mortality (6.7%) than a living-donor source (4.0%) (P <    0.005). Recipients aged 0-1, 2-5, 6-12, and 13-17 years old had mortality rates of 17.5, 8.0, 3.6, and 4.5%, respectively (P <    .001). Mortality rates increased substantially when examined by recipient and cadaver donor ages (mortality rates of up to 45%), the greater the concordance between young donor and recipient ages. Interestingly, acute tubular necrosis and graft failure less than 30 days after transplantation (GH30) were each associated with markedly elevated mortality rates. (The risk ratio for ATN was 3.1 [P <    0.001] and for GF30 it was 6.4 [P <    0.001].) Mortality after transplantation was also affected by the underlying renal disease, with high mortality rates observed for oxalosis (n = 21, 33.3%), congenital nephrotic syndrome (n = 79, 15.2%), pyelo/interstitial nephritis (n = 54, 11.1%), and Drash syndrome (n = 14, 21.4%). When the joint effect of these risk factors was examined in a Cox proportional hazards model, young recipient age (0-1 years old) and GF30 were significant (P <    .001) risk factors of mortality for recipients of living-donor organs. For recipients of cadaver kidneys, young recipient age--0-1 years old (P <    .001) and 2-5 years old (P = .002)--ATN (P = .029), and GF30 (P <    .001) were all significant risk factors. Recipient age is the major determinant of increased mortality after renal transplantation. Avoidance of acute tubular necrosis by reducing cold time and preventing early graft failure by better matching techniques in this vulnerable population may improve the mortality rate."
7430105	"There is evidence that calcium antagonists may have a beneficial effect on cyclosporine-induced nephropathy after transplantation. We treated 50 consecutive non-diabetic patients receiving their first cadaveric transplant with isradipine, a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, or placebo in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. There were no significant differences between the two groups as regards age, weight, sex, HLA matching and ischaemic periods. To achieve optimal vasodilation, treatment was started intravenously 2 h before the transplantation procedure, and continued orally afterwards for 3 months. The immunosuppressive treatment included rabbit antithymocyte globulin on day 0, and oral cyclosporine from day 5. In both groups 7 patients had primary non-functioning grafts, but the incidence of never functioning kidneys due to vascular and thrombotic complications was significantly higher in the placebo group (0 vs 4 patients, P <    0.05). Hypertension was treated with oral labetolol in combination with guanfacine if necessary. In the placebo group antihypertensive medication had to be prescribed significantly more often (67% vs 33% of patients, P <    0.05), but resulted in similar blood pressure recordings in the two study groups. Cyclosporin A (CsA) plasma concentrations were also comparable but in the isradipine group a significantly higher dose of CsA was needed to achieve adequate levels (8.0 +/- 0.5 vs 6.2 +/- 0.5 mg/kg per day, P <    0.01). However, in the isradipine-treated patients creatinine clearance was significantly higher (66.1 +/- 4.5 vs 55.6 +/- 6.2 ml/min, P <    0.05) after 3 months. We conclude that isradipine is an effective antihypertensive agent after kidney transplantation. Isradipine ameliorates CsA-induced nephropathy and seems to protect against early postoperative vascular complications."

After obtaining consent those suspected of IDH had specimens taken for blood counts, immunoglobulins, serum protein electrophoresis, viral studies (including genotyping), skin swabs and stool examinations.                                                                              Nineteen of 60 suspected cases recruited over 3 years met the diagnostic criteria for IDH. The male-to-female ratio was 1:2; mean age 8 years (range 0.7 to 15). Dermatitis mostly affected the scalp (78.9%) and axilla (73.7%); fewer children had nasal crusting (47.4%). Mean Ig A, IgG and IgM were raised, at 3.52 g/l, 22.6 g/l and 1.38 g/l, respectively. The median CD4 cell count was 1958 cells/mm3. Viral genotyping of all tested samples were positive for the Cosmopolitan, Subtype A (HTLV-1a).                                                                                      IDH is a distinct entity which also affects South Africans. Our patients were older at presentation and the majority did not present with nasal crusting as has been described in other countries."
5590432	"Granulomatous slack skin is a rare cutaneous disorder with less than 50 cases presented in the English-language literature. The disease is characterized by circumscribed erythematous lax skin accentuated most commonly in the axillary and inguinal areas. A strong association with a preceding or evolving diagnosis of mycosis fungoides or Hodgkin's disease has been reported. Previous reports describe the entity as a lymphoproliferative disease in the same spectrum as mycosis fungoides and Hodgkin's disease with a monoclonal T-cell population. Our case, without an evident beta-T-cell receptor rearrangement, suggests that not all cases of granulomatous slack skin are a result of an indolent lymphoma. Granulomatous slack skin probably represents a spectrum of diseases that can eventuate into a lymphoproliferative process."
9333098	"Scalp biopsies are crucial for the diagnosis of cicatricial alopecia. However, the pathologic interpretation may not be diagnostic if biopsy is not obtained from the correct site. This is particularly relevant for cicatricial alopecia as the disease may be focal and disease activity difficult to appreciate by the naked eye.                                                                                  To report a new simple technique to select the optimal biopsy site in cicatricial alopecia.                                                                              In the last 2 years we performed dermoscopy guided scalp biopsies using handled dermatoscopes in 80 patients with different forms of cicatricial alopecia. Biopsy site was selected based on presence of the following dermatoscopic features: perifollicular concentric white scales in lichen planopilaris, frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA) and discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE); hair tufts in folliculitis decalvans, hairs surrounded by a peripilar grey-white halo in central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia and follicular red dots or keratotic plugs in DLE.                                                                              The dermoscopy guided biopsies yielded a definitive pathological diagnosis in 95% of the cases.                                                                                  The advantage of this method is that it is a fast, precise way to identify even individually affected follicles in early or focal cicatricial alopecia. It also allows for the morphologic characterization of particular follicular structures."
6829641	"The role of cell-cell adhesion in the transition from premalignancy to invasive cancer is not well understood. The purpose of this study was to determine how abrogation of E-cadherin-mediated adhesion influenced early neoplastic progression in tissues that mimic human, premalignant disease. To accomplish this, E-cadherin function was abrogated in a human cell line representing an early stage in the transformation process (HaCaT-II-4 cells) that was grown in three-dimensional, organotypic cultures with intact basement membrane. Before modification, this cell line showed a paucity of cell adhesion structures by ultrastructural and immunohistochemical analysis, whereas immunoblot studies demonstrated that expression and association of E-cadherin and catenins were not diminished when compared with normal keratinocytes. To further reduce functional E-cadherin, II-4 cells were infected with a dominant-negative, recombinant adenovirus, expressing E-cadherin lacking an extracellular domain (AdECadEC). AdECadEC infection resulted in loss of endogenous E-cadherin and completely disrupted II-4 cell adhesion, as seen by loss of beta-catenin from II-4 cell junctions in monolayer culture. In three-dimensional cultures, AdECadEC-infected cells demonstrated disruption of tissue architecture, loss of cell-cell adhesion, and the invasion of individual tumor cells into the stroma. The induction of this invasive phenotype was associated with loss of basement membrane integrity, as seen by degradation of type IV collagen and laminin 5. These studies showed that loss of E-cadherin-mediated adhesion enabled acquisition of an invasive phenotype, suggesting that maintenance of intercellular adhesion and tissue organization plays a crucial part in suppressing the incipient stages of squamous cell cancer progression."
1078462	The growing use of anti-TNF drugs during the last years has reopened the discussion about the possible increased risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma in patients with such type of treatments.

9738811	"Previous studies of exposure of normal skin to ultraviolet radiation have demonstrated a cumulative effect lasting greater than 24 h when repeated suberythemal exposures are given. However, the time course of recovery from a single suberythemal dose of ultraviolet A (UVA) or ultraviolet B (UVB) has not been determined. We show here for the first time that the period required for recovery of normal skin (as measured by delayed erythema) following a single suberythemal dose of UVA is between 30 and 48 h, and for UVB is between 24 and 30 h. Photoprotection was noted for both UVA and UVB from the fifth through the ninth day after the single suberythemal exposure, but was only statistically significant on the fourth day after UVB exposure. The curve depicting recovery from a single suberythemal dose of UVA or UVB from the first irradiation time through the fourth day after irradiation may be described as an exponential decay curve. Formulas are given for both UVA and UVB which describe the exponential nature of this curve. These formulas may be used to predict the exact difference in erythema threshold between preirradiated and normal skin. From the fourth day after exposure to the ninth day, the curve is nearly constant. The nature of the recovery curve in the first 4 days after exposure suggests that an exponential decay process occurs in UVA or UVB damage, consistent with unstable photoproduct decay, DNA repair, or constitutive enzymatic processes."

However, few and controversial data have been published to date on the role and number of these cells in atopic dermatitis (AD).                                                                                   To investigate the number of CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ Tregs and interleukin 10-producing T regulatory type 1 (Tr1) cells in patients with AD.                                                                              Peripheral blood and skin biopsy samples from atopy patch test (APT)-positive patients with acute- and chronic-phase AD were investigated. Immunohistochemistry was applied to identify CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ Tregs in the skin, while flow cytometry was used to detect CD4+CD25highFOXP3+ Tregs and Tr1 cells in the peripheral blood.                                                                              In the peripheral blood samples of patients with AD significantly elevated numbers of Tr1 cells were found. Although neither the absolute number nor the percentage of CD4+CD25highFOXP3+ Tregs showed significant alteration in the peripheral blood of patients, increased numbers of FOXP3+ Tregs were detected in skin biopsy specimens. All of the APT-positive skin samples showed epidermal dendritic cell aggregates, morphologically consistent with so-called Langerhans cell microgranulomas, which also contained intermingled FOXP3+ Tregs.                                                                                      Tr1 cell numbers were elevated in the peripheral blood and increased numbers of CD4+CD25highFOXP3+ Tregs were detected in the skin of patients with AD. The epidermal dendritic cell clusters in APT-positive lesional skin showed a close connection to the FOXP3+ Tregs."
5645650	"Hypertension is one of the most frequent complications of renal transplantation. About 70% to 90% of this population display either high blood pressure (BP) or require antihypertensive therapy. Diabetes mellitus is also a common finding among kidney transplant recipients. The aim of the study was to assess the BP control among kidney transplant recipients according to the prevalence of diabetes. This retrospective analysis included 172 renal transplant recipients of overall mean age 50 years and 51% males. Hypertension was present in 79% of patients. About one-third of the studied population showed abnormal blood pressures based on office measurements. The cohort was divided into two groups according to the presence of diabetes: group 1, diabetic patients (n = 14) versus group 2, nondiabetics (n = 158). Nondiabetic patients were significantly older than diabetic ones (61.5 versus 49 years; P <    .05) and their time after renal transplantation was longer (98.83 versus 67.33 months, P <    .05). There was no difference in regard to hypertension prevalence, mean BP value, percentage of abnormal (≥ 140/90 mm Hg) BP values or glomerular filtration rate. Diabetic patients were prescribed less steroid. The main hypotensive drug used in whole cohort and in no-diabetic patients was a beta-blocker (n = 64, 37%; n = 4, 28%), patients with diabetes used beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors at the same frequency (n = 60, 37%). The main causative factor for hypertension appeared to be the calcineurin inhibitor. More aggressive antihypertensive treatment using combined drugs, including RAS blockers, might provide adequate BP control among renal transplant subjects with high cardiovascular risk."
4050325	"Contact hypersensitivity is one of the most common skin diseases and its pharmacological control is an important clinical issue. We investigated the control of contact hypersensitivity by immunosuppressive drugs administered during sensitization or challenge. Mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil completely inhibited contact hypersensitivity when administered during sensitization whereas they did not decrease inflammatory reaction when administered during challenge. Conversely, mitoxantrone, and cyclophosphamide, given as a single injection at the time of sensitization or challenge, completely inhibited the reaction, a property associated with T and B cell depletion. The data indicate that antimetabolites which are cell cycle dependent inhibit clonal expansion and subsequent differentiation of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Their lack of effect at the time of challenge indicates that T cell proliferation is not required for the expression of effector or regulatory T cell activation. Conversely lymphoablative drugs can inactivate or destroy differentiated cytotoxic T cells with rapid kinetics."
1228714	"Empyema necessitatis refers to a collection of exudative fluid that extends directly from the pleural cavity to the thoracic wall to form a mass in the extrapleural soft tissue of the chest. It was an uncommon complication of tuberculous pleural effusion even in the pre-antibiotic era, and has also been associated with bacterial lung abscess, actinomycosis, blastomycosis, and malignancies.                                                                              Seven instances of chest wall mass lesion secondary to empyema necessitatis, diagnosed by fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB), are reported.                                                                              Three cases were tuberculous, two were mesotheliomatous, one was caused by pulmonary small cell carcinoma, and another was due to coexisting Actinomyces and Actinobacillus. In all patients, subsequent pleural fluid cytologies demonstrated empyema with the respective etiologies identified.                                                                                      The usefulness of FNAB in the diagnosis of empyema necessitatis, supported by radiographic imaging and ancillary procedures, is well illustrated by these seven cases."
8698680	"Immune-modulating medications, such as the tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors, are establishing a niche in the dermatologic therapeutic armamentarium as novel, effective, and relatively safe alternatives in the treatment of numerous inflammatory dermatoses. The benefits of anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor therapy are well known. However, these agents are also associated with an increased risk of infectious complications--most commonly granulomatous infections with mycobacteria and fungi. We present a teenaged boy with localized, cutaneous Cryptococcus albidus infection on the scalp which occurred after he began etanercept for refractory psoriasis. The infection resolved after a course of fluconazole. This is the second report of localized, cutaneous C. albidus infection, but the first occurring in association with etanercept therapy. Our patient's findings remind us that extra vigilance is imperative in monitoring patients on immunosuppressive regimens and that any persistent, nonhealing lesion in these patients should prompt evaluation for potential infection, not only from common and typical pathogens but also from more unusual, atypical ones."
1679379	Thrombocytopenia was observed in 3 patients with cutaneous angiosarcoma of the scalp and face. A sudden decrease in the platelet count occurred in association with rapid enlargement of primary or metastatic lesions. Neither antiplatelet antibody nor platelet-associated IgG was detected. Increased serum levels of beta-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4 indicated that platelets were destroyed and consumed within the vascular bed of the tumor. Prominent PECAM-1 expression on tumor cells may be involved in intratumoral platelet aggregation and consumption. We suggest that the sudden development of profund thrombocytopenia in patients with angiosarcoma may suggest either rapid growth of the primary tumor or herald the development of metastatic disease.
6646653	"A questionnaire sent to 325 U.K. dermatologists regarding toxicity of antimalarials had a 70% response rate. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was used by 168 respondents, chloroquine (CQ) by 66, and mepacrine by 89 (only 111 always chose one of these). HCQ was considered to be the most effective by 59%, and to have the least cutaneous side-effects by 66%; mepacrine was considered to have the lowest frequency of ocular side-effects by 50%. Thirty respondents had encountered ocular side-effects, but in most cases these were mild. Maculopathy after short-term therapy was identified as a side-effect which is rarely considered. Ocular side-effects were believed to be due to cumulative dose alone by 31%, to dose/body weight alone by 8%, to duration of treatment alone by 3%, and to combinations of these by 58%. Overall, cumulative dose was considered relevant by 85%, duration of treatment by 52%, and dose/body weight by 41%. Referral for ophthalmology screening was always performed at baseline or after an initial trial of therapy by 56%; 17% never referred patients for baseline screening; 60% routinely requested ophthalmological follow-up. In comparison, 14% of respondents routinely referred patients for baseline ophthalmological screening before PUVA therapy (only 52% of whom routinely referred patients before antimalarial therapy). The most important factor contributing to an individual's current practice was experience in training posts (52%), followed by advice of local ophthalmologists (45%), personal experience (19%), specific publications (16%), and manufacturers' recommendations (14%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
8268007	"Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a serious drug eruption that results in death in approximately 25% to 50% of patients. There is controversy over whether SCORTEN accurately predicts mortality or if treatment interventions such as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) can alter mortality.                                                                                   We sought to determine whether SCORTEN accurately predicts mortality in this cohort, whether IVIg improved survival, and which drugs and medical comorbidities impacted mortality.                                                                              We summarize our experience prospectively over 5 years and 82 patients. Patients either received supportive care, intravenous immunoglobulin, or cyclosporine as treatment. All patients had a SCORTEN on admission, an offending drug on record, and a list of medical comorbidities.                                                                              Of the 82 patients, 29% died from TEN. SCORTEN accurately predicted mortality in this cohort with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.83 in a receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis. A Kaplan-Meier curve did not show improved mortality if patients received IVIg versus supportive care (P = .9). Medications most often responsible for TEN were trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, followed by anticonvulsants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, and allopurinol.                                                                                      This prospective cohort study design is not as ideal as patients presenting for a randomized controlled trial.                                                                                      SCORTEN was an accurate predictor of mortality in this cohort. Age older than 40 years, the presence of metabolic syndrome and/or gout, higher body surface area involvement, higher SCORTEN, and higher number of medical comorbidities statistically significantly increased risk of death. IVIg did not significantly alter mortality. Although the highest number of cases was due to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, the greatest proportion of deaths was due to allopurinol."

It is used to treat patients with moderate-persistent to severe-persistent asthma; patients must be older than 12 years, have a positive skin test to a perennial aeroallergen (e.g., dust mites, cats, dogs, and mold), and be symptomatic with inhaled corticosteroids. Omalizumab has a low incidence of side effects, and it is very expensive. The exact dosage of omalizumab dosage is determined by body weight and pretreatment serum total IgE levels. Omalizumab may have a role in the treatment of atopic dermatitis when IgE plays a causal role."
3420790	"The association between parathyroid hormone (PTH) level and mortality in dialysis patients is controversial. We hypothesized that wasting, a common condition potentially related to adynamic bone disease, modifies the association of PTH with mortality and cardiovascular events (CVE), respectively.                                                                              We analysed data from 1255 diabetic haemodialysis patients, participating in the German Diabetes and Dialysis Study between 1998 and 2004. The patients were stratified by the presence or absence of wasting (albumin <   or=3.8 versus albumin >   3.8 g/dL; BMI <   or=23 versus BMI >   23 kg/m(2)). Using Cox regression analyses, we calculated the risks of (1) all-cause mortality and (2) CVE according to baseline PTH levels. All analyses were adjusted for age, sex, atorvastatin treatment, duration of dialysis, comorbidity, HbA1c, phosphate, calcium, blood pressure, haemoglobin and C-reactive protein.                                                                              Patients had a mean age of 66 +/- 8 years, and 54% were male. Among patients without wasting (albumin >   3.8 g/dL, n = 586), the risks of death and CVE during 4 years of follow-up significantly increased by 23% and 20% per unit increase in logPTH. Patients in the highest PTH tertile had a 74% higher risk of death (HR(adj) 1.74, 95% CI 1.27-2.40) and a 49% higher risk of CVE (HR(adj) 1.49, 95% CI 1.05-2.11) compared to patients in the lowest PTH tertile. In contrast, no effect was found in patients with wasting. Accordingly, additional analyses in strata of BMI showed that PTH significantly impacted on death and CVE [HR(logPTH)(adj) 1.15 and 1.14, respectively] only in patients without, but not in patients with, wasting.                                                                                      Wasting modifies the association of PTH with adverse outcomes in diabetic dialysis patients. High PTH levels are of concern in the patients without wasting, while the effect of PTH on mortality is nullified in the patients with wasting."

Pretransplant sera of 24 KT recipients were retrospectively tested for sCD30 and compared with PRA. Inclusion criteria were de novo graft patients on calcineurin-inhibitor-based immunosuppression, minimum follow-up of 1 year, alive with a functioning graft, and stable renal function over the last 12 months. Objective measures were incidence of biopsy-proven AR (BPAR) within 6 months of KT and sCD30 and PRA diagnostic indexes. The relative risk (RR) of BPAR for each test was also obtained.                                                                              Fourteen (58.3%) patients presented at least one episode of BPAR within 6 months of KT. All rejection episodes were responsive to steroid treatment. PRA was positive in six (25%) patients, and four (66.7%) of them presented at least one episode of BPAR. sCD30 tested positive in nine (37.5%) patients, and all these later presented at least one episode of BPAR. sCD30 and PRA diagnostic indexes in predicting early (<    6months) BPAR were sensitivity 64.2% versus 28.5%; specificity 100% versus 80%; accuracy 79.1% versus 50%; positive predictive value 100% versus 66.6%; and negative predictive value 66.6% versus 44.4%. The RR of early AR was 1.4 in PRA-positive patients and extremely higher in the sCD30-positive group.                                                                                      Pretransplant sCD30 is a more accurate predictor of AR when compared with PRA. These results support its use in the pretransplant work-up of kidney-graft recipients."
7524785	"Chlorophyll precursors Mg-protoporphyrin IX and its monomethylester are candidates for plastid-derived molecules involved in light signalling from the chloroplast to the nucleus. The pool sizes of these two Mg2+-containing porphyrins and of protoporphyrin IX transiently increased upon a shift of Chlamydomonas cultures from dark to light. This increase coincided with the accumulation of mRNAs encoded by the nuclear genes HSP70A and HSP70B. Analysis of a mutant (brs-1), previously shown to be defective in the light induction of these genes, revealed high levels of protoporphyrin IX but no light-induced increase in the levels of Mg2+-containing porphyrins. Inhibitors of cytoplasmic protein synthesis prevented both the light-induced rise in pool levels and induction of the HSP70 genes. Similarly, pre-gametes, intermediates of sexual differentiation, lacked both responses to light. The block in light induction of the HSP70 genes in inhibitor-treated cells and in pre-gametes could be circumvented by the exogenous addition of Mg-protoporphyrin IX in the dark. This suggests an essential role for light-induced Mg-protoporphyrin IX accumulation in this chloroplast-to-nucleus signalling pathway. However, accumulation of this porphyrin in the dark - presumably in the chloroplast - did not result in induction. A second crucial role for light in this signalling pathway is postulated which makes this plastidic compound accessible to the cytoplasm/nucleus where the downstream signalling pathway may be activated."
4372535	"Psoriasis commonly responds beneficially to UV radiation from natural sunlight or artificial sources. Therapeutic mechanisms include the proapoptotic and immunomodulating effects of UV, affecting many cells and involving a variety of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, downregulating the Th17/IL-23 response with simultaneous induction of regulatory immune cells. However, exposure to UV radiation in a subset of psoriasis patients leads to exacerbation of the disease. We herein shed light on the predisposing factors of photosensitive psoriasis, including genetics (such as HLA-Cw*0602 or CARD14), gender and coexisting photodermatoses such as polymorphic light eruption (PLE) in the context of potential molecular mechanisms behind therapeutic photoresponsiveness or photoaggravation. UV-induced damage/pathogen-associated molecular patterns, damage to self-coding RNA (signalling through Toll-like receptors), certain antimicrobial peptides and/or inflammasome activation may induce innate immunity, leading to psoriasis at the site of UV exposure when there is concomitant, predisposing resistance against UV-induced suppression of the adaptive immune response (like in PLE) that otherwise would act to reduce psoriasis."

There are two fundamental approaches to address this conundrum. First, it is possible to use a purified cell population and submit these cells to various assays. The second approach is to manipulate a target molecule and determine what effect this has on T-cell homeostasis in vitro and in vivo. This molecular strategy may help characterize multiple regulatory populations that use the same pathway for controlling T-cell function. Through a concerted two-pronged effort, the authors' laboratory and others have attempted to decipher different molecular pathways for regulatory cell function. Several gene knockout mouse models display a phenotype of profound lack of homeostasis in which T cells accumulate, presumably because of a defect in regulation. Dependent on the molecule disrupted, the immune cell subset being examined may no longer be appropriately regulated. Accordingly, the phenotype of exogenously added ""putative"" regulatory cells can then be examined by assessing their ability to control this aberrant accumulation. By using co-transplantation techniques, much information can be postulated regarding potential regulatory cell phenotype and function. Model systems with target gene manipulations involving Fas ligand, Fas, perforin, interleukin-2, and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 exist and in all cases appear to disrupt critical cytotoxic regulatory cell function."
7495457	"Root-knot nematodes (RKN) are severe pests of maize. Although lipoxygenase (LOX) pathways and their oxylipin products have been implicated in plant-nematode interactions, prior to this report there was no conclusive genetic evidence for the function of any plant LOX gene in such interactions. We showed that expression of a maize 9-LOX gene, ZmLOX3, increased steadily and peaked at 7 days after inoculation with Meloidogyne incognita RKN. Mu-insertional lox3-4 mutants displayed increased attractiveness to RKN and an increased number of juveniles and eggs. A set of jasmonic acid (JA)- and ethylene (ET)-responsive and biosynthetic genes as well as salicylic acid (SA)-dependent genes were overexpressed specifically in the roots of lox3-4 mutants. Consistent with this, levels of JA, SA, and ET were elevated in lox3-4 mutant roots, but not in leaves. Unlike wild types, in lox3-4 mutant roots, a phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) gene was not RKN-inducible, suggesting a role for PAL-mediated metabolism in nematode resistance. In addition to these alterations in the defense status of roots, lox3-4 knockout mutants displayed precocious senescence and reduced root length and plant height compared with the wild type, suggesting that ZmLOX3 is required for normal plant development. Taken together, our data indicate that the ZmLOX3-mediated pathway may act as a root-specific suppressor of all three major defense signaling pathways to channel plant energy into growth processes, but is required for normal levels of resistance against nematodes."
1610103	"POLYAMINE OXIDASE 1 (OsPAO1), from rice (Oryza sativa), and POLYAMINE OXIDASE 5 (AtPAO5), from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), are enzymes sharing high identity at the amino acid level and with similar characteristics, such as polyamine specificity and pH preference; furthermore, both proteins localize to the cytosol. A loss-of-function Arabidopsis mutant, Atpao5-2, was hypersensitive to low doses of exogenous thermospermine but this phenotype could be rescued by introduction of the wild-type AtPAO5 gene. Introduction of OsPAO1, under the control of a constitutive promoter, into Atpao5-2 mutants also restored normal thermospermine sensitivity, allowing growth in the presence of low levels of thermospermine, along with a concomitant decrease in thermospermine content in plants. By contrast, introduction of OsPAO3, which encodes a peroxisome-localized polyamine oxidase, into Atpao5-2 plants could not rescue any of the mutant phenotypes in the presence of thermospermine. These results suggest that OsPAO1 is the functional ortholog of AtPAO5."

An aspirate of fluid from a bulla revealed uric acid crystals and serum uric acid was elevated at 16.2 mg/dL. A diagnosis of tophaceous gout was made."
9234224	"The London Cord Blood Bank was established with the aim of collecting, processing and storing 10000 unrelated stem cell donations for the significant number of children in the UK requiring transplantation, for whom a matched unrelated bone marrow donor cannot be found. Collection is performed at two hospitals by dedicated cord blood bank staff after delivery of the placenta. Mothers are interviewed regarding medical, ethnic and behavioural history by nurse counsellors and sign a detailed consent form. Donations are returned to the bank for processing. Volume reduction is undertaken by a simple, closed, semi-automated blood processing system, with excellent recovery of progenitor cells. Units are cryopreserved and stored in the vapour phase of liquid nitrogen. Blood samples from mothers and cord blood donations are tested for the UK mandatory red cell and microbiology markers for blood donors. Donations are typed for HLA-A, B and DR at medium resolution (antigen split) level using sequence-specific oligonucleotide probing and sequence-specific priming techniques. The selection of collection hospitals on the basis of ethnic mix has proven effective, with 41.5% of donations derived from non-European caucasoid donors. Bacterial contamination of collections has been dramatically reduced by implementation of improved umbilical cord decontamination protocols."
9027375	"Skin phototesting and cellular sensitivity studies were performed in a patient with xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) complementation group E (XP80TO) at the ages of 50 and 55 years. She showed a reduced minimal erythema dose at both ages, but the dose at age 55 was much lower than that at age 50 when tested with monochromatic ultraviolet (UV) light (280, 290 and 300 nm). The cellular sensitivity to UVC (254 nm), UVB and UVA and UVC-induced unscheduled DNA synthesis were examined using fibroblasts obtained by skin biopsy at the ages of 50 and 55 (XP80TO-1 and XP80TO-2, respectively). DNA synthesis was similar in both cell lines. XP80TO-2 cells were more sensitive to UVB cytotoxicity than XP80TO-1 cells in both the dividing and quiescent phases, but both cell lines exhibited a similar sensitivity to UVC and UVA. These results suggest that the in vitro cellular sensitivity to UVB may correlate with the clinically observed erythema reaction. Further, the results suggest that some XP complementation group E cases at least may show an increase in photosensitivity in vivo and in vitro with aging."
9357948	"To examine how human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections affect human papillomavirus (HPV) infections.                                                                                  MEDLINE was searched for relevant publications.                                                                                      All studies dealing with both HIV and HPV infections were reviewed.                                                                                      Publications with clinically relevant data were included in the present analysis.                                                                                     A critical analysis of the data described in these articles was performed without formal statistical calculations.                                                                                      Results revealed that immunocompromised individuals have an increase prevalence of HPV-associated lesions and neoplasia. Immunosuppressed patients (eg, those who have undergone transplantation or those who have been treated with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy) have a higher rate of HPV infections. Human papillomavirus and HIV appear to be important cofactors for developing cervical and anal dysplasia and carcinoma. Individuals who are seropositive for HIV have an increased prevalence of HPV infections, a more rapid progression of the disease, and a higher number of invasive carcinomas. The presence of HPV DNA, extent of disease, and potential for malignant transformation also appear to correlate with the degree of immunosuppression. Individuals with a CD4 cell count under 0.20 x 10(9)/L (<    200/microliters) are at greatest risk. Treatment options for immunocompromised individuals remain similar to those for normal hosts; however, immunocompromised individuals have a much higher rate of recurrence. Improved immunostimulant and/or antiviral therapy is needed for HIV-seropositive individuals with widespread genital involvement. Control of both the HPV and the HIV epidemics involves at least 3 levels of intervention: better antiviral drugs, frequent monitoring for disease progression in infected persons, and better education to reduce spread of the disease."
7700198	"We studied 13 prognostic factors in 582 patients with clinical stage I melanoma to determine which factor or combination of factors was associated with death from melanoma within the first 24 months following diagnosis. Thirty-six patients died during this period. Only 2 deaths occurred in patients with primary tumors thinner than 1.70 mm, and only 2 patients of 189 died with tumors located on the non-BANS extremities, excluding the hands and feet. Individual factors associated with high risk for death within 2 years included level V tumors, acral location, thickness greater than or equal to 3.65 mm, histologic ulceration greater than 3 mm, nodular type, presence of microscopic satellites, greater than 6 mitoses/mm2, positive elective node dissection, absence of lymphocyte response at the tumor base, and absence of an associated nevus histologically. Many of the preceding individual factors are highly correlated. By the use of logistic regression analysis, only one very high risk group was found: 71 percent of patients with level V tumors greater than 1.70 mm thick with histologic ulceration width greater than 3 mm located in an area other than the extremities (excluding hands and feet) had died within 2 years of diagnosis. The ability to select high-risk groups should be useful to investigators involved with the design and evaluation of adjuvant therapy studies."
4040732	"Genes for seven putative serine proteases (ChpA-ChpG) belonging to the trypsin subfamily and homologous to the virulence factor pat-1 were identified on the chromosome of Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis (Cmm) NCPPB382. All proteases have signal peptides indicating export of these proteins. Their putative function is suggested by two motifs and an aspartate residue typical for serine proteases. Furthermore, six cysteine residues are located at conserved positions. The genes are clustered in a chromosomal region of about 50 kb with a significantly lower G + C content than common for Cmm. The genes chpA, chpB and chpD are pseudogenes as they contain frame shifts and/or in-frame stop codons. The genes chpC and chpG were inactivated by the insertion of an antibiotic resistance cassette. The chpG mutant was not impaired in virulence. However, in planta the titre of the chpC mutant was drastically reduced and only weak disease symptoms were observed. Complementation of the chpC mutant by the wild-type allele restored full virulence. ChpC is the first chromosomal gene of Cmm identified so far that affects the interaction of the pathogen with the host plant."
7021891	"Several controversies exist regarding the relationship between hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and some cutaneous manifestations, lichen planus (LP) in particular.                                                                                   To determine the prevalence of LP and other cutaneous manifestations in a cohort of patients infected with HCV from low HCV endemic area of Slovenia, to correlate findings with chosen biological variables and to assess the role of interferon (IFN)-based treatment of HCV infection in cutaneous manifestations. Methods A total of 171 consecutive HCV-seropositive patients and 171 HCV-seronegative age- and gender-matched controls were studied prospectively. Prevalence of cutaneous manifestations, comparison between study patients and controls and correlation of skin findings with demographic, biochemical, virological and liver histologic findings as well as IFN-based therapy were assessed.                                                                              Overall presence of LP in HCV-seropositives was 2.3%; although LP was not found in controls, the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.123). Significantly higher than in controls was the prevalence of pruritus (31.0%, P <    0.001), dry skin (16.4%, P <    0.001) and hair loss (9.9%, P <    0.001). In IFN-based treatment naïves, skin findings were more frequent compared with controls, but not significantly, with no correlation to chosen biological variables. Current IFN-based treatment was significantly connected to pruritus (P <    0.001) and dry skin (P <    0.001). Compared with treatment naïves, in post-treated patients pruritus (odds ratio, 19.13; 95% confidence interval, 6.85-53.42; P <    0.001), dry skin (odds ratio, 4.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.44-12.31; P <    0.001) and hair loss (P <    0.001) were significantly more common.                                                                                      LP was not significantly related to HCV infection. Prevalence of pruritus, dry skin and hair loss was significantly higher in post-compared with pre-treated patients. The role of IFN in post-treatment persistence of skin manifestations needs to be assessed."
2393837	"Leprosy remains an important problem globally. Timely detection of new cases and prompt treatment with MDT continue to be the main intervention strategies. We review the various issues related to classification, treatment, drug resistance and the possible steps to eliminate the disease in the near future. The need for newer anti leprosy agents has been felt and various agents like fluroquinolones, macrolides and minocycline have all been tried in various combinations and duration. Uniform MDT in all leprosy patients might be a logical one too. Drug resistance can be identified by PCR based DNA sequence analysis which saves much time. Drugs like thalidomide analogues, pentoxifylline, selective cytokine inhibitory drugs have proved effective in controlling type-2 reaction in leprosy patients. New drugs for leprosy reactions are still needed. Far from being eliminated as a public health problem, leprosy still causes a considerable long term morbidity in both developing and developed world. New treatment and the optimal length of MDT requires further research. We need genome based technology to address the unresolved issues of transmission of M. leprae."
8321609	"Trichoscopy corresponds to the scalp, and hair dermoscopy has been increasingly used as an aid in the diagnosis, follow-up, and prognosis of hair disorders. Trichoscopy represents a valuable link between clinical and histological diagnosis. Tinea capitis (TC) and alopecia areata (AA) are considered the most common causes of hairless patches of the scalp in pediatrics. TC may have the same clinical appearance of AA, so dermoscopy has recently become a useful diagnostic tool for AA and TC, particularly in doubtful cases. The aim of this study is to identify the trichoscopic features of TC and AA in children that may facilitate in their differentiation from each other and choosing the appropriate treatment, which is a non-invasive method of diagnosis."
4010057	"If hyperacute rejection is prevented in the guineapig (GP)-to-Lewis rat (Lew) cardiac xenograft (CXg) model, an accelerated rejection involving cellular infiltration occurs in 3 to 4 days. In previous work using an adoptive transfer model, we found that this accelerated rejection was facilitated by either sensitized splenocytes or sensitized serum. In the current study, in an attempt to determine which splenocyte subset(s) facilitated this process, sensitized splenocytes, with or without subset depletion were injected, into complement- and natural antibody-depleted Lew recipients of GP CXgs. Graft survival was 4.18 +/- 0.75 days with no injection (n = 11), 4.13 +/- 0.99 days with naive splenocytes (n = 8), 1.80 +/- 0.45 days with sensitized splenocytes (n = 5), 2.67 +/- 1.03 days with CD4(W3/25+) depletion of the sensitized splenocytes (n = 6), 3.13 +/- 0.84 days with CD8(OX8+) cell depletion (n = 8), 4.70 +/- 0.68 days with macrophage depletion (n = 10), and 4.22 +/- 0.41 days with B cell depletion (n = 9). Cellular infiltrates, hemorrhage, myocyte necrosis, and endothelial deposition of IgG, IgM, and fibrin were seen in rejected grafts. In most groups, infiltrating cells consisted of CD4 (W3/25+), CD8 (OX8+), IL2R+ cells, macrophages, and natural killer (NK) cells. However, in the macrophages-depleted group, activated (ED2+) macrophages and NK cells were significantly reduced. Total IgM, anti-GP IgM, and anti-GP IgG rebounded in all groups over several days but were not consistent at the time of rejection. Lewis rats rejecting GP CXgs early had lower final titers than those rejecting later. Total IgG titers rebounded to baseline by posttransplant day 1 and were therefore similar in all groups at the time of rejection. These findings suggest that this accelerated rejection requires interaction between macrophages and B cells, since depletion of either significantly alters the rejection tempo. A possible explanation is that xenoreactive IgG antibodies, synthesized by sensitized B cells, bind their target antigens--but also bind sensitized macrophages through their Fc region, thus causing rejection by antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity."
7581863	"Angioendotheliomatosis is a rare disorder with both cutaneous and systemic clinical presentations. We agree that there is evidence in the existing medical literature for the separation of reactive and malignant (neoplastic) variants of angioendotheliomatosis. These variants share similar histologic and ultrastructural features but seem clinically distinct. The reactive variant has been associated (four of seven cases, including our patient) with existing or preexisting subacute bacterial endocarditis."
4081200	"Based on previous experience with parenteral prostanoids, we studied the effect of misoprostol treatment, an orally administered prostaglandin E1 analog, in patients with erythromelalgia. Treatment with placebo was followed by treatment with misoprostol (0.4-0.8 mg per d), both for 6 wk. The patients (n=21) and a study nurse who administered the trial were blinded. The endpoints were change in pain and need for cooling and global assessment of the treatment. Following central body heat provocation, global skin perfusion, capillary morphology, and change in pain were also recorded before and after each treatment period. Results were compared with data from healthy control subjects (n=11) that did not undergo treatment. Clinical safety and tolerability evaluation included physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, and monitoring of adverse events. All clinical outcome measures were significantly better after treatment with misoprostol (p<   0.01) as compared with placebo treatment and after a 3- mo follow-up without treatment. The heat-induced increase in global perfusion after misoprostol treatment was similar to the control group and significantly lower when compared with baseline (p<   0.01) and placebo treatment (p<   0.05), respectively. This study demonstrates that misoprostol is clinically superior to placebo in patients with erythromelalgia. The results of the perfusion studies may imply that the mechanism of action of the beneficial effect of misoprostol is reduced microvascular arteriovenous shunting in affected skin."
2455177	"The rates of both genetic and non-genetic living donors are increasing. However, previous research has almost exclusively explored the decision-making of genetic donors. Therefore, in this study both genetic and non-genetic donors are investigated with focus on their whole donation process.                                                                              Thirty-nine donors were interviewed the day before nephrectomy and 3 weeks afterwards. Twenty-three donors were genetic relatives, 16 were not. The interviews were analysed qualitatively, mainly by narrative structuring.                                                                              All donors but one passed seven steps in the donation process. They included: (i) awareness of suffering; compassion and empathy; (ii) imminence of transplantation; recognition of oneself as potential donor; (iii) information acquisition and deliberation; (iv) attribution of responsibility to oneself; announcement of decision to donate; (v) examination; maintaining the decision; (vi) facing nephrectomy; and (vii) postoperative experiences. Two types of decision-making were displayed: immediate and later announcement of decision. Half the donors belonged to each type. Various relationship groups displayed different types. The examination period was the most stressful time, partly due to imperfect coordination and excessive time-wasting. One-third found postoperative pain the most painful experience ever. There was a lack of attention to regressive needs and to recognition of the deed.                                                                                      The two types of decision-making seem similar in ethical requirements. It is not a genetic or non-genetic relationship per se that determines what kind of decision the donors make. Psychological support, especially during Steps 5 and 7, should be improved and the donors included in a structured donation programme. Possible health care ambivalence toward living donation should not affect the donors."

8208899	"Capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome (CM-AVM) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by RASA1 mutations. The prevalence and phenotypic spectrum are unknown. Evaluation of patients with multiple CMs is challenging because associated AVMs can be life threatening. The objective of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics of children presenting with features of CM-AVM to an academic pediatric dermatology practice. After institutional review board approval was received, a retrospective chart review was performed of patients presenting between 2009 and 2012 with features of CM-AVM. We report nine cases. Presenting symptoms ranged from extensive vascular stains and cardiac failure to CMs noted incidentally during routine skin examination. All demonstrated multiple CMs, two had Parkes Weber syndrome, and two had multiple infantile hemangiomas. Seven patients had family histories of multiple CMs; three had family histories of large, atypical CMs. Six had personal or family histories of AVMs. Genetic evaluation was recommended for all and was pursued by six families; four RASA1 mutations were identified, including one de novo. Consultations with neurology, cardiology, and orthopedics were recommended. Most patients (89%) have not required treatment to date. CM-AVM is an underrecognized condition with a wide clinical spectrum that often presents in childhood. Further evaluation may be indicated in patients with multiple CMs. This study is limited by its small and retrospective nature."
1976487	"Using an especially-designed facility, the Mode Stirred Reverberation Chamber, we exposed tomato plants (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. VFN8) to low level (900 MHz, 5 V m(-1)) electromagnetic fields for a short period (10 min) and measured changes in abundance of three specific mRNA soon after exposure. Within minutes of electromagnetic stimulation, stress-related mRNA (calmodulin, calcium-dependent protein kinase and proteinase inhibitor) accumulated in a rapid, large and 3-phase manner typical of an environmental stress response. Accumulation of these transcripts into the polysomal RNA also took place (indicating that the encoded proteins were translated) but was delayed (indicating that newly-synthesized mRNA was not immediately recruited into polysomes). Transcript accumulation was maximal at normal Ca(2+) levels and was depressed at higher Ca(2+), especially for those encoding calcium-binding proteins. Removal of Ca(2+) (by addition of chelating agents or Ca(2+) channel blocker) led to total suppression of mRNA accumulation. Finally, 30 min after the electromagnetic treatment, ATP concentration and adenylate energy charge were transiently decreased, while transcript accumulation was totally prevented by application of the uncoupling reagent, CCCP. These responses occur very soon after exposure, strongly suggesting that they are the direct consequence of application of radio-frequency fields and their similarities to wound responses strongly suggests that this radiation is perceived by plants as an injurious stimulus."
8412718	"Palpable migratory arciform erythema is a T-cell pseudolymphoma with no well-established treatment. The disease is rarely reported in the literature, perhaps because it is difficult to diagnose. We present a case of a variant of PMAE in a 30-year-old healthy man with no history of medication use and erythematous to violaceous annular and arciform plaques on his face, scalp and trunk. This case is of particular significance because gene rearrangement studies and histopathologic findings are concerning for folliculotropic mycosis fungoides while the clinical course does not support this diagnosis. The authors' emphasize that clinical history is imperative for definitive diagnosis of palpable migratory arciform erythema as it can clinically and histopathologically resemble other cutaneous lymphocytic diseases."
8056647	"Parvovirus B19 is the aetiological agent of erythema infectiosum. The presence of B19 DNA in lesional skin of other cutaneous manifestations has frequently been reported although there is disagreement on the role of the B19 virus in tissues.                                                                                   To investigate the presence of B19 DNA (1) in skin lesions of patients with a described B19-related disease, (2) in skin lesions of B19-unrelated diseases and (3) in healthy skin.

B19 DNA was detected in 11/38 (28.9%) pityriasis lichenoides, 8/30 (26.7%) melanocytic naevi, 5/29 (17.2%) primary melanomas and 6/24 (25.0%) healthy skin biopsies. A difference in B19 DNA prevalence was observed in specimens grouped according to age, irrespective of pathologies.                                                                                      B19 DNA can be found in skin tissues of patients with pityriasis lichenoides as well as in lesions not related to B19 infection and in healthy controls. B19 DNA can be detected in skin of young subjects in a significantly high rate compared to adults, suggesting that viral persistence may be the usual outcome after primary infection."
6659042	"Hepatocyte transplantation has been proposed as an alternative to orthotopic liver transplantation to treat metabolic liver diseases. This approach requires preconditioning of the host liver to enhance engraftment of transplanted hepatocytes. Different methods are currently used in preclinical models: partial hepatectomy, portal ligature or embolization, and radiotherapy or chemotherapeutic drugs. However, these methods carry high risks of complications and are problematic for use in clinical practice. Here, we developed an innovative method called volumetric (distal, partial, and random) portal embolization (VPE), which preserves total liver volume.                                                                              Embolization was performed in the portal trunk of C57BL6 adult mice with polyester microspheres, to ensure a bilateral and distal distribution. The repartition of microspheres was studied by angiographic and histological analyses. Liver regeneration was evaluated by Ki67 labeling. Optimal conditions for VPE were determined, and the resulting regeneration was compared with that after partial hepatectomy (70%). Labeled adult hepatocytes were then transplanted, and engraftment was compared between embolized (n = 19) and nonembolized mice (n = 8). Engraftment was assessed in vivo and histologically by tracking labeled cells at day 5.                                                                              The best volumetric embolization conditions, which resulted in the regeneration of 5% of total liver, were 8 × 10 ten-micron microspheres infused with a 29 G needle directly into the portal trunk at 3.3 μL/s. In these conditions, transplanted hepatocytes engraftment was significantly higher than that in control conditions (3 vs 0.65%).

The study period was 1 year. Patients were divided into two groups according to their body-weight and drinking habits. The smaller patients underwent 150-min dialysis sessions three times weekly. The larger patients underwent 3-h treatments thrice weekly. The treatment was adequate in all patients according to the KT/V criteria of adequacy. The intradialytic symptomatology was remarkably low and the treatments were well tolerated in all patients. The study confirms the reliability of paired filtration dialysis as a short dialysis technique. In some patients 150 min may be insufficient to achieve an adequate dialysis efficiency and 180 min may be required for the majority of the population."
3380025	"We present a set of tests for physical performance used for annual prospective follow-up after a pediatric transplant. Of the 103 eligible patients transplanted at a mean age of 8.8 years, 94 were included. The results were divided into early, performed 1 (n=46) or 2 (n=12) years post transplant, and late tests (n=66), performed 4-16 (mean 6) years post transplant. A total of 30 patients had tests both at early and late time points (paired tests). The control subjects included 522 healthy age- and gender-matched schoolchildren. Using their test results, the s.d. score (SDS) was calculated for each patient and for each test individually. Both in the early and late tests, patients had the mean SDS for each test significantly lower (P<   0.001) than controls, varying from -0.6 to -2.0 SDS. Specifically, tests measuring trunk muscles gave impaired results. In the group with paired tests, the results improved in four of six tests. In late tests, age at SCT, extensive chronic GVHD and being a sports club member correlated with the results. The potential beneficial effect of an exercise intervention program on impaired physical performance after pediatric SCT merits prospective studies."
8919986	"Previously reported cases of acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis secondary to brown recluse spider bite have been questioned due to lack of identification of the spider or because of the concomitant administration of antibiotics. We report a 9-year-old boy who arrived at the emergency department with a confirmed Loxosceles reclusa bite to the neck. On the third day of hospitalization, he developed hundreds of monomorphous, sterile pustules, initially in intertriginous areas. The eruption disseminated and was followed by pinpoint desquamation typical for acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis. During this he also developed late onset Coombs-positive hemolytic anemia and systemic loxoscelism. Sphingomyelinase in Loxosceles venom induces the production of interleukin-8 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, providing a mechanism by which Loxosceles reclusa bite may trigger acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis. We suggest that this case adds Loxosceles envenomation to the spectrum of agents that can trigger acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis."

To identify the source of clinical practices among dermatology residents that affect patient safety and determine the best approach for overcoming gaps in knowledge and practice patterns that contribute to these practices.                                                                                                        A survey-based study, performed at a national medical dermatology meeting in Itasca, Illinois, in 2012, included 142 dermatology residents from 44 residency programs in the United States and Canada.                                                                                                 Self-reported rates of dermatology residents committing errors, identifying local systems errors, and identifying poor patient safety role modeling.                                                                              Of surveyed dermatology residents, 45.2% have failed to report needle-stick injuries incurred during procedures, 82.8% reported cutting and pasting a previous author's patient history information into a medical record without confirming its validity, 96.7% reported right-left body part mislabeling during examination or biopsy, and 29.4% reported not incorporating clinical photographs of lesions sampled for biopsy in the medical record at their institution. Residents variably perform a purposeful pause (""time-out"") when indicated to confirm patient, procedure, and site before biopsy, with 20.0% always doing so. In addition, 59.7% of residents work with at least 1 attending physician who intimidates the residents, reducing the likelihood of reporting safety issues they witness. Finally, 78.3% have witnessed attending physicians purposefully disregarding required safety steps.                                                                                                    Our data reinforce the need for modified curricula, systems, and teacher development to reduce injuries, improve communication with patients and between physicians, residents, and other members of the health care team, and create an environment free of intimidation."
8537137	"The SCORAD (Index) is the best validated scoring system in atopic dermatitis (AD). Modification of the SCORAD Index has led several times to incorrect use of the system. To measure the extent of AD, the rule of nines is applied on a front/back drawing of the patient's inflammatory lesions. The extent can be graded from 0 to 100. The intensity part of the SCORAD consists of 6 items: erythema, oedema/papulation, excoriations, lichenification, oozing/crusts and dryness. Each item can be graded on a scale from 0 to 3. The subjective items include daily pruritus and sleeplessness. The SCORAD Index formula is: A/5 + 7B/2 + C. In this formula A is defined as the extent (0-100), B is defined as the intensity (0-18) and C is defined as the subjective symptoms (0-20). The maximal score of the SCORAD Index is 103. The objective SCORAD consist of the extent and the intensity items; the formula is A/5 + 7B/2. The maximal objective SCORAD score is 83 (with 10 additional points for severe disfiguring eczema of the face and hands). Patients should also evaluate their dermatitis, because their well-being is the most important aspect of treating AD. Therefore different self-assessment scores for AD patients, including the patient-oriented SCORAD, were developed. The patient-oriented SCORAD correlates well with the SCORAD Index. The Three-Item Severity (TIS) score involves the scoring of erythema (redness), oedema and excoriations (scratches) in one representative lesion. The TIS score corresponds well with the objective SCORAD and can be used as prescreening system or as a quick system in studies and is excellent for epidemiological studies."
8474738	"Vanden Driessche (1978) proposed that EDTA prevents the seismonastic leaf movement (the closing movement) of the pinnules (tertiary pulvini) ofMimosa via inhibition of the contraction of Ca (2)?,?-regulated contractile proteins. However, the effects of EGTA and EDTA on the leaf movement of the laminar pulvinus ofPhaseolus coccineus L. and the primary pulvinus ofMimosa pudica L. are contrary to the effects measured at the tertiary pulvini (pinnules) ofMimosa or Al- bizzia. EGTA and EDTA (5 to 25 m M) inhibit the upward (opening) movement and induce a downward (closing) movement of the laminar pulvinus ofPhaseolus and the primary pulvinus ofMimosa. High EGTA and EDTA concentrations «freeze» these pulvini in the night (closed) position of the leaves, whereas the tertiary pulvini ofMimosa andAlbizzia in the day (open) position. However, there is evidence that these contrary leaf movement reactions of the different pulvini are due to structural differences and not to different actions of these substances. In excised flexor and extensor tissues of the laminar pulvinus ofPhaseolus EDTA and EGTA induce a netto efflux of osmotica in hypotonic solutions. DMSO (5 to 10%, v/v), which change also the permeability of membranes, induces, similar to EDTA, an opening of the pinnules (tertiary pulvini) ofMimosa in light and dark and inhibit the seismonastic or dark-induced closing movement. However, in the laminar pulvinus ofPhaseolus , DMSO (3 to 5 %) induces a closing movement and «freezes» the lamina in the physiological night position. We conclude therefore, that leakage of osmotica induces night (closed) position in such pulvini, which are lowered during the night and elevated during the day, and day (open) position in such pulvini, which are elevated during the night and lowered during the day. Thus experiments with EDTA give no evidence that contractile proteins play an essential role in the mechanism of circadian, nyctin- astic, or seismonastic leaf movements."
9800667	"The ultraviolet component of sunlight is the major cause of skin cancer and is responsible for accelerating the aging of human skin. It is therefore important to determine the mechanisms by which ultraviolet light alters normal cellular functions. The potential importance of ultraviolet light-induced damage to non-DNA targets has received little attention. Since the cytoskeleton is an important participant in the control of normal cell growth, the microfilaments and microtubules of UV irradiated human skin fibroblasts have been studied using fluorescence microscopy. Polychromatic ultraviolet light, composed of environmentally relevant wavelengths, was found to disrupt the cytoplasmic microtubule complex in a dose dependent manner. The induction of microtubule disassembly did not correlate with the cytotoxicity of ultraviolet light of varying composition."
4639643	"Rosmarinic acid is known to have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities. This study was performed to evaluate the effect of rosmarinic acid on atopic dermatitis (AD), one of the inflammatory disorders of the skin. Twenty-one subjects (14 women and seven men, 5-28 years of age) with mild AD participated in this study. Rosmarinic acid (0.3%) emulsion was topically applied to the elbow flexures of AD patients twice a day (once in the morning and once in the evening). All subjects were evaluated for skin conditions before treatment at the first visit, and then at 4 and 8 weeks after treatment. According to local Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis index results, erythema on antecubital fossa was significantly reduced at 4 and 8 weeks (P <    0.05). Transepidermal water loss of the antecubital fossa was significantly reduced at 8 weeks compared to before treatment (P <    0.05). The results from self-questionnaires on the efficacy of rosmarinic acid indicated that dryness, pruritus and general AD symptoms improved. Our investigation into the AD-mitigating effect of rosmarinic acid through in vivo experiments demonstrated the possible clinical use of rosmarinic acid as a therapeutic agent for AD."
4784670	"An uncommon type of epidermal nevus characterized by systematized bands of non-epidermolytic hyperkeratosis with increased hairiness and follicular hyperkeratosis was observed in a 16-year-old boy who showed, in addition, hemihypoplasia of limbs, brachydactyly, clinodactyly and onychodystrophy. This case cannot be categorized within the group of presently established epidermal nevus syndromes. Most likely, this combination of anomalies represents a new type of epidermal nevus syndrome."
